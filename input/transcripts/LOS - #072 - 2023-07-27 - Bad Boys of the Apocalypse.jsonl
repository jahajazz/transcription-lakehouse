And he will be the light of the nations and the hope of those whose hearts are troubled. All who dwell on the earth will fall down and worship him. And they will praise and bless and celebrate with song the lord of spirits. First Enoch, chapter 48, verses 4 through 5. The modern world doesn't acknowledge, but is nevertheless haunted by spirits, angels, demons and saints. In our time, many yearn to break free of the of a flat secular materialism, to see and to know reality as it truly is. What is this spiritual reality like? How do we engage with it? Well, how do we permeate everyday life with spiritual presence? Orthodox Christian priests Father Andrew Stephen Damick and Fr. Stephen DeYoung host this live call in show focused on enchantment in creation, the union of the seen and unseen as made by God and experienced by mankind throughout history.

You're listening to the Lord of Spirits podcast. My co Host, Father Stephen DeYoung is with me from the sweltering and highly humid Lafayette, Louisiana. And I'm here in Emmaus, Pennsylvania. Cool and clean, 80 degrees Fahrenheit. I'm Father Andrew. Stephen Damick. Tonight we're not taking any calls because once again, this is a pre recorded episode. God willing, we will be live with you again for our next episode. Father Stephen and I are pre recording because we are. When you hear this, when it premieres, both in an apocalyptic location, also known as Phoenix, Arizona. Based on recent temperatures, it might well be a gateway to the underworld. What do you think? Write in, let us know. That said, we're not going to the underworld tonight. At least I hope not. Pray for our repentance. Tonight we're continuing our series on eschatology, talking about the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, Gog and Magog, and the armies of locusts from the north. Yes, it's Enemies of God night on the Lord of Spirits podcast. So set your GPS for Armageddon. So my first question is whether the Four Horsemen were doing real wrestling or not."}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #072 - 2023-07-27 - Bad Boys of the Apocalypse","start":488.68,"end":587.67,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Anyway, Bible itself. All right, so the four Horsemen are in Revelation, Chapter six. And to kind of set up what's going on, though, we have to dip a little bit back into chapter five. So the four Horsemen show up, make their appearance in the context of the opening of the seven seals. So there's this. In Revelation 5, there is this scroll in heaven. The scroll is sealed with seven wax seals that have to be broken in order to open the scroll. And first, there's sort of a liturgical ritual thing that happens in chapter five to try to locate the one who is worthy to open the scroll, to break the seals and open the scroll. That person is ultimately determined to be the Lamb who was slain, who is going to then break these seals and open the scroll. The scroll is a representation of sort of the deed or the title, the ownership or the authority over creation over the world, over the cosmos. And this is why a worthy person needs to be found to again, take possession of the creation, the created order, and to put it back in order to restore justice to It."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #072 - 2023-07-27 - Bad Boys of the Apocalypse","start":587.67,"end":606.04,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Yeah. I mean, this feeds into. It's the same theme as when Jesus is about to ascend and he says, all authority or all power in heaven and earth have been given to me. You know, I've taken it back from the dark powers that usurped it. This is mine. So this is just another way of depicting that same kind of thing."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #072 - 2023-07-27 - Bad Boys of the Apocalypse","start":606.76,"end":652.57,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Right. And remember, as we've talked about now several times on the show, to judge is to put things back into the proper order that justice represents. Right. So this taking of possession is also a judgment. Right. It's a putting things back the way they're supposed to be after a situation of injustice has prevailed for some time and things are out of order and not the way that they should be. And so in chapter six, as the lamb opens the first four seals, breaks those first four seals, after each one, one of the four horsemen sort of appears."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #072 - 2023-07-27 - Bad Boys of the Apocalypse","start":652.89,"end":653.69,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Yeah, right."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #072 - 2023-07-27 - Bad Boys of the Apocalypse","start":654.85,"end":661.49,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"And you get behold a lot in English translations, behold, which in Greek is."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #072 - 2023-07-27 - Bad Boys of the Apocalypse","start":662.45,"end":666.05,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Right. Although I love a good lo."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #072 - 2023-07-27 - Bad Boys of the Apocalypse","start":669.09,"end":742.38,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Yeah, yeah. And what this is all covering for is actually a word in the Hebrew Bible, hine. And if you want to really irritate a Hebrew professor of any stripe, translate the word hine as behold with a big exclamation point after it. So it is related to one of the Hebrew verbs, meaning to see, which is why it gets translated as idu. Right. This idea of, like, look. But the idea behind the word is that it's only quasi translatable. It's supposed to give, in a sense, give a sense of immediacy or suddenness or kind of a surprise twist. Right. It's not totally dissimilar from how we use the word look in the sense of if you and I were talking and we were going back and forth, and all of a sudden I said, look. Right. I wouldn't be actually telling you to look at something. I would just be. It would be, like, to get your attention."}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #072 - 2023-07-27 - Bad Boys of the Apocalypse","start":747.38,"end":774.68,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Which, I mean, like, in, you know, in Old English, there's a word like this, which is hwat, which is the first word of a number of different poems, including Beowulf. And I mean, it is the ancestor of our modern English word. What? But there's a lot of debate about how to translate the word. And it seems to be like, listen up, pay attention. You know, hey, it's not just an interjection. It's. It's. It's definitely a call for attention."}

So as each of the horsemen shows up, you get this behold. Right. But it's trying to. You could always translate like, boom. Right, Right. He opens the seal and boom, there's a. Right. There's a rider on a horse. Right. You could do bada bing, bada boom, I guess."}

However you want to do it. But that's the idea is this sense of immediacy. So it's not like he sees somebody riding up in the distance, like they're coming from someplace, and then they show up. It's just, bang, there they are. Right?"}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #072 - 2023-07-27 - Bad Boys of the Apocalypse","start":830.69,"end":893.08,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Right, Right. So then the question is, so who. Who are these guys who are popping up during these first four seals? Because seals 5, 6 and 7 are different. And we're going to mention a little later seal five, but there aren't seven horsemen of the Apocalypse. Right. This is four out of the seven seals. And as Father Andrew already mentioned, you may have in your head, based on old X Factor comics or Good Omens or some other thing, War, Famine, Pestilence and Death. Right. As the names of the Four Horsemen. But actually in the text, in Revelation 6, only one of them is actually named. Only one of them is said to have a name."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #072 - 2023-07-27 - Bad Boys of the Apocalypse","start":893.08,"end":894.12,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Yeah. And that's death."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #072 - 2023-07-27 - Bad Boys of the Apocalypse","start":895.24,"end":1042.05,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Yeah. The other three not only aren't named, but aren't even said to have a name necessarily. Right. So they're identified in the text based on the descriptions that St. John gives for each of them. Right. The details of their description. And when I say the details of their description, it's not like he spends, you know, a longish paragraph giving all these details. No, we're talking about a short, relatively short sentence. Right. Where he gives a few details, but that are sufficient for his audience to understand who and what he's talking about. So we have received those names, Pestilence, War, Famine and Death. We received the other three, other than death, through the Christian tradition. Right. But not from the text itself. But also, those aren't sort of random. Those aren't. Well, this church father or that church father or this group of church fathers, or even all the church fathers agree that this is who they are and that's why that's who they are. As we mentioned, the imagery that St. John uses that we're going to go through here, the imagery he uses is imagery that's found not only in the cultures surrounding the Old and New Testaments, but also within the Old Testament tradition. Itself. Right. This is true in general of the Book of Revelation. The. Well, so the biggest reason people probably misunderstand the Book of Revelation is that they're trying to interpret it based on a recent newspaper or news broadcast, I should say, I guess, or the Internet. But the second biggest reason why people misinterpret the Book of Revelation is that, by and large, we aren't familiar enough with the Old Testament, especially with Old Testament prophetic books."}

And notice that they're given authority over a fourth of the earth to kill with sword, famine and pestilence. That would be the other three. Right. That we're going to talk about.

The word we have for death is Thanatos. And of course, we also have Hades, the Greek word for which is Hades. So Hades is kind of obvious. Right. But the sort of easy identification then to make would be, well, if St. John is appealing to sort of elements and concepts in the broader culture surrounding the scriptures and surrounding his original hearers at the end of the first century, then this would be a reference to maybe the Greek God Thanatos. There's a Greek God named Thanatos and the Greek God Hades. Right. Like, maybe that's just the. He's making just this direction connection. The problem with that idea is that the way he here is describing Thanatos and Hades doesn't really match the concepts of Thanatos and Hades, the Greek gods, such that it doesn't look like he's referring to those, because those would give a very different impression than the one he's clearly trying to give in context. So Thanatos is or was the brother of Hypnos. Hypnos is one of the gods of sleep. He's the God of, like, deep, dreamless sleep. Not the God of dreams?"}

That's the kind of death that he represented. Right. He's sort of like the Grim Reaper and the dog meme, you know, where the dog asked him if he was a good boy. This is like the. That kind of death.

But if you go back to ancient Semitic religion, if you go back to Canaanite religion, Phoenician religion, and you go to their God of death, who's named Death, Mote, you find somebody who looks a lot more similar, Right. Because Mote was both the God of death who went around dealing death, and he also ruled over the underworld as a sort of tyrant. And so he was, after capturing, killing. Right. Enslaving everybody. Right. Remember, he eats baal in the baal cycle. And so this kind of idea that St. John is describing with death here is much closer to moat, that kind of idea of God. Mot is also often depicted as or with, alongside of him, some kind of beast or creature with a big open, gaping maw that represents Sheol, the grave, the underworld. Right. The hellmouth who's sort of swallowing up his victims, Right. Like he's chucking them in there, or sometimes he's just the one swallowing, like with BAAL and the BAAL cycle. But also importantly, in terms of this description by St. John, MOT also had a little retinue of gods, Right. He had an entourage who traveled around with him. And the way that St. John sort of depicts the sword and famine and pestilence going out in front of Death and sort of killing. Right. Reaping souls or whatever, however you want to imagine it. Right. And then him sort of collecting them up and feeding them to Hades, sort of how St. John is depicting this, that's very much in keeping with Mote, who had these other gods of pestilence and of famine and of war with and around him. Right. Who sort of fed him the living. Right. So it seems pretty clear that. And the way death is described helps us see this, that St. John is drawing on this earlier sort of Canaanite structures."}

And it's not always obvious to us, but in the ancient world especially, but probably still to this day, at least in many places, there's a very close connection between war and plague. We now know from the perspective of science, that a lot of this has to do with issues of sanitation. When you have an army camped out at war, that's a prime breeding ground for disease, because you've taken a whole bunch of people from one place and brought them to another place and then put them in close quarters with not great sanitation in an ancient military camp. At the same time, a lot of ancient warfare was laying siege to cities. And so what you did when you laid siege to a city was you cut off supplies going in, you cut off sanitation going out. And so the people inside, both due to malnourishment affecting their immune systems and the sanitation issues caused by being under a siege, would have outbreaks of plague and disease within the city. And that's part of what would help break a lot of sieges. Right. It's just people would have to stay closed up in the walls and all die, or they would have to surrender. So there was this. This connection, right, between disease and warfare that allowed him to also be a God of war, A God whose favor would be sought out by those going to war, or who would be. Who those going to war would want to target against their enemies instead of them."}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #072 - 2023-07-27 - Bad Boys of the Apocalypse","start":2437.45,"end":2788.89,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Reshev was so popular that he gets assimilated beyond sort of his home base where he originates is in. In the Levant. So in Canaan, Phoenicia, Aramea, Syria. Right. This is. This is where Refesh originally comes from. But he gets assimilated into Egyptian religion and maintains his name and maintains his general appearance from West Semitic religions, which is kind of unusual for Egypt. They continue to depict him as an Asiatic, which is what they called foreigners from the rest of the ancient Near East. He gets assimilated, at least at Cyprus, into Apollo. So you get these early depictions of Apollo in Cyprus, where he has the arrows, and the arrows are said to bring plague he's referred to, or there's a reference in the iliad in book one, lines 42 through 55, to Phoenician Apollo, which is apparently Homer's way of referring to Reshef, right? He sees him as a particular hypostasis, a particular localization of Apollo. He's being a Greek, seeing the correlation the opposite way from what it seems to have been historically, it seems Apollo seems to have been Greek Resche. More the other way around. But. And in the treaty between Hannibal the Carthaginian general of the Phoenicians and Philip of Macedon, the king of Macedonia, Apollo is one of the gods who is invoked as a witness to the treaty, this Venetian Apollo, because he seemed to be a God who they both share, right? And so can both appeal to in some way. So he is of some major significance. And so the imagery of Reshef as pestilence and his arrows then gets picked up in a bunch of places in the Old Testament to describe pestilence and plague. So, for example, Deuteronomy 32, verses 23 and 24, God says, I will pile evils upon them. My arrows will I exhaust on them. They will be wasted with hunger. They will be devoured by Reshef and Ketev the poisonous, right? So this is God talking about his judgment against the wicked. And you can see here, language, we're going to be coming back to this of him sort of letting Reshef and Keteb, who's another sort of plague God, sort of loose on them, right? Sort of sicking Reshef on them as part of that judgment. In Psalm 78, in the Hebrew 77, in the Greek verse 48, that Psalm goes through. It sort of meditates on the plagues on Egypt. And so in that psalm, when it gets to describe the seventh plague in verse 48, it describes God describes that plague as having given up the cattle to hail and the herds to the Reshefs to plague or to disease, right? It's sometimes translated in English, but the word there is literally the name of this spiritual being. Habakkuk 3:5 describes death. Deber, who's another similar kind of God, of famine and trouble, going before Yahweh and Reshef following behind, following after him. What Habakkuk is doing there in Habakkuk 3 is he's describing that kind of entourage or retinue that's usually attributed to Mot, right? Where Mot has sort of these minions who go and do these things. And in Habakkuk it's actually Yahweh who is in control of those minions. And again, that's an idea we'll come back to a little later. In Psalm 76 in the Hebrew, 75 in the Greek, verse 4, it's talking. God is talking there about putting an end to war and to battle. And he says that he shattered the ref chefs of the bow. And this is kind of typical. I know we've mentioned Mantu before, who was the Egyptian God of war, who was said to be the right arm of Re. And so when you read in the prophets, a lot of the prophecies in the Hebrew Bible against Egypt talk about God breaking the right arm of Egypt, right? That's the idea of him, you know, being able to wreck their. Their war God. This is the same kind of thing, right? Reshef being this war God with a bow. Right. It's saying God can snap him the way you, you know, snap a bow over your knee or something."}

So job 5, verse 7, one of the descriptions of Job's afflictions talks about the sons of Reshef that fly through the air. That's sort of the image of. Right. The sons of Reshef would be the arrows that he shoots that carry the pestilence and the disease. And of course, I know we've talked about. I'm pretty sure this is one of the places where we talked about Reshef before was in terms of Psalm 91 in the Hebrew, 90 in the Greek, which is in the Dead Sea Scrolls. That's. Of the six exorcism psalms that they held were written by David. Psalm 91, 90 is the one that's actually a canonical psalm. The other five we only know from Qumran. But so that exorcism Psalm in verse 5 talks about the arrows that fly by day. All of those, if you read the original Hebrew, are references and this is. Again, I believe we've gone through this on the show, and that's one of the places we talked about Reshef, the, you know, the demon of Noonday. All of those things are references to particular sort of demonic entities and spirits of calamity in the ancient world."}

And since it's in a list of very clear references, sometimes using the names of other demonic entities, it's a pretty clear link.

Nonetheless, everywhere you look, that's what this horsemen is. Is called. And that's because even though I imagine most folks, not everybody, but I imagine most folks hadn't really heard of Reshef before this show or some other similar show or they read DDD or something, that identification that we just sort of walked through has been held onto in. Within the Christian tradition, even if it hasn't been made explicit. Right. Even if there isn't some place where somebody sat down and said, yes, this is Reshef. Da da da da da da da. That's why we say that this horseman is Pestilence. Right. The horseman just identified as Pestilence. That interpretation is continued and contained in the tradition. And so this is, I think, illustrative of how we work with our holy orthodox tradition on this show a lot of the time. We will sometimes. I don't know. We will sometimes. Sometimes there are folks out there who assume that if they listen to this show, for example, and hear something they've never heard before, that either we're making it up or this is some newfangled academic thing or something, and therefore can't be part of orthodox tradition somehow because they haven't heard it before. There's a bunch of problems with that. One being if you assume that anything you haven't heard before is new, you're assuming you know everything."}

Like they're really good at it, but they're doing the same thing. Right. But yeah. So you could even compare. And this is the problem. This is why people have heard me Say, if understood correctly, the fathers never actually disagree. Right. Because the way that a particular passage of Scripture needs to be drawn out and laid out and explained to a congregation in a certain economic and social group in 19th century Russia, and the way it needed to be drawn out and laid out and explained to another congregation in Constantinople near the end of the 4th century is not identical."}

I mean, I can give a really quick example which is like if you read St. Theophan the Recluse is a 19th century Russian saint. He writes a lot of letters to people. He often talks about feelings, like having certain kinds of spiritual feelings. People in the 5th century didn't talk that way at all. They weren't talking about, have a feeling, go for this feeling, follow this feeling. Now what Saint Theophan means by feeling is not what late 20th and early 21st century, you know, post Freudian ideas about feelings mean by feelings.

My new book, An Introduction to Extra Biblical Literature, is now available. A lot of Christians today divide ancient Jewish and Christian literature into two categories. What's in the Bible? What's not in the Bible? Christian east, however, has traditionally had a third category, a middle category, books that are read privately in the home. The Greek word for that is Apocrypha. These texts from the centuries before and the centuries after the incarnation of Christ that go beyond even the larger canons of Orthodox and Roman Catholic churches reveal to us the religious world and theological framework of the apostles and early church fathers. In this book, Apocrypha, I survey these works which connect elements of liturgy, scripture, iconography, patristic writings. Familiarity with these works will enhance readers understanding of the breadth and depth of the Orthodox Christian faith.

They're thinking Dark Riders. They're thinking, this must be one of those completely disproportionate anime swords that's so giant the person wielding it could not possibly lift it. You're probably going too far with it. So this rider. Identifying this rider as war is not much of a stretch, right? So he takes peace from the earth. And if you take peace away, what do you have? You have war so that people should slay one another. That's war. Right. But the important element here in terms of identifying this rider with a kind of demonic entity or entity in general from the Old Testament is this sword, and specifically the way in which the sword is referred to in the Hebrew Bible. There are a lot of places where the sword is used, where it's clearly not referring to a sword, right? Just a sword as an. As an object. And where the sword is talked about as being an entity, as being something with agency that does things, something that is sent, something which remains in a place or in a family or among a people. And so it takes a certain kind of special pleading that modern people are very capable of, but it takes a kind of special pleading to read it as just being a metaphor, right? Oh, there's just going to be, like, strife and violence. Right. And the problem with. I mean, let's get right down to it. The problem with taking it as a metaphor is that strife or violence has to have an agent."}

Like someone's just standing there minding their own business, and all of a sudden, you know, they be. Are physically injured by nothing in particular. Right. Like, violence has to have an agent. Right? And so if violence or strife or conflict is going to come into a family, a tribe, a nation, right. Between one of those and another of those. Right. It has to have an agent. There has to be someone who's actually doing it. Right? And so there are places in scripture very clearly where God sends an agent to do something, sometimes something violent, right. Like sending in the descendants of Abraham to root out the giant clans. Right. There's the agent. Right. Or when God sends Nebuchadnezzar to take Judah into exile for their sinfulness. Right. Where he sends the Assyrians to wipe out the northern kingdom of Israel, there you've got your agent. Right. But there are other places where God just says he's going to send the sword."}

So that's not speaking as an analogy for violence in general or bloodshed in general. That's speaking of a kind of entity, a spiritual entity, meaning it's a spirit, because it has agency. An entity with agency that's going to inspire and cause this violence and bloodshed and strife to happen. Relatedly, another term that's used beside the sword in a similar kind of way is the way the Hebrew word for blood is used when it's used in the plural bloods. So not dam, but damim, which literally means bloods. Right. But which, when used in the plural, represents not just, again, metaphorically, while blood's plural, lots of blood, bloodshed. Right. But referring to a kind of agent connected to bloodshed. So to give you an idea, we're not going to read all these. We're not going to go through all these. But to give you an idea of how common these references to the sword as an agent are in the Hebrew Bible, here is a partial list. This is a partial list. Okay. And I'm just going to Jack Van Impiet. I'm going to go through it full speed. You can look it up later. You can pause this if you really want to look every single one up. Exodus 5, 8, 22, 24 Leviticus 26, verses 7 and 8 and 25, numbers 14, 43, numbers 20, verse 18, Deuteronomy 28, verse 22 and 32, verse 25, 2 Samuel 2, 26, 11, 20, 25, 12, 10, 18, verse 8, Ezra 9, 7, Job 5, 15, 20, 22, 29, 27, verse 14, 39, verse 22 Psalm 22, verse 20, Psalm 37, verse 15, Psalm 63, verse 10, Psalm 76, verse 3, Psalm 78, verse 62, and 64 Psalm 144, verse 10, Isaiah 1, verse 20, 31, verse 8 and 37, verse 7."}

But that should give you an idea of how common this is to say, talk about the sword as this agent, the spiritual agent. Right. And often it is, the sword is associated with verbs like devour, consume. Right. This idea of devouring, consuming lives. Right. A la mote, the hellmouth. Right. And so here we can kind of see the pattern emerging, right. This is gonna hold true when we get to famine also, that these other three, these are sort of the three ways you don't want to die. So the blessed way to die in the Hebrew Bible is old, full of years, surrounded by your grandchildren and great grandchildren around your table. That's the blessed way to die, Right. That's the way the patriarchs die in."}

Well, the ways you die, other than that, the ways you die short of that, the way you miss that blessing are what? Violence, disease, starvation. Right. In the ancient world, in an agrarian context, we may not think about starvation as much as we used to. We're also not living in an agrarian context. Right. There are parts of the world that still, famine and starvation are very real concerns, even if they aren't for us in a lot of the countries that will be listening to this in English, but in the ancient world, they were for everybody, right? So these three kinds of death in particular, these are like the bad deaths. These are the deaths you don't want. Violence certainly being one of the chief among them. Now, bloods, when bloods is used in the plural, it's a little more nuanced because the bloodshed here isn't just violence, but it's a kind. It refers to a kind of debt related to vengeance for spilled blood, right. The idea being if a person has spilled innocent blood, right. They've committed kind of a paradigmatic injustice, right? There's a person who should be alive, right. Who should be part of the world, of the social order, but because of you, is dead, right? And so this is a paradigmatic injustice. And one of the problems with it as a paradigmatic injustice is, right, if I steal money from you, there's a relatively easy way to put that back to justice, right?"}

Right. Fratricide. And this is seen as sort of not just because it's related to the family. It's not only murder, it's murder that's a form of high sacrilege. Right. And so even if you don't get caught, right. These, you know, the erinyes will sort of come up out of Hades and drag you down with them. Right. And tear you apart. There is this kind of vengeance, right. That's. It's like cosmic. These demonic entities of cosmic vengeance, which is not unrelated to how, for example, most 1980s horror movies function. They're very similar to Greek tragedy in that respect. All the non virtuous kids are the ones who end up dead, all the ones who sleep around and use drugs and that kind of thing, they all end up getting torn to pieces by the. The sort of cosmic entities.

And this is that Hebrew idiom. The idea is that day, it's not just that David feels guilty, Right. It's that having killed Uriah and taken Bathsheba as his wife. He is liable to that blood. There is this sort of metaphysical debt that he has. He has on his soul. Right. That he needs to be. He needs to be delivered from the consequence of that by God. Of course, it goes.

So when Joseph came to his brothers, they stripped him of his robe, the robe of many colors that he wore, and they took him and threw him into a pit. The pit was empty. There was no water in it. Then they sat down to eat, and looking up, they saw a caravan of Ishmaelites coming from Gilead with their camels bearing gum, balm, and myrrh on their way to carry it down to Egypt.

Right. Because it's not like you walk into a village, there's not some massive authority who could come and say, okay, this is how much. Exactly how much a shekel weighs. And this guy's shekel in his ballot scale is heavier than it should be, or this one's is lighter than it should be. Right. Like, there's no way to go around enforcing that, Right, right. Hypothetically, we have that now, I'm somewhat suspicious that at no time recently has anyone been to any of our local gas stations and actually measured a gallon of gas to make sure it's really a gallon. Hypothetically, they do that, but they definitely did not do anything like that in the ancient world. Right. And so the way someone. The primary way someone was dishonest in business, when you're trading, because you're primarily trading in the ancient world by close to pure bartering. Right. Is by fudging weights. Right. By, you know. Oh, yeah, yeah. I'm giving you this much of that and you're actually giving them less."}

The people who most got taken advantage of in the ancient world were the poor and the powerless. Right. So people who are in poverty in general, especially orphans and widows, because orphans and widows couldn't even take you to court over it. Right. There were people who could be exploited. And so again and again, you see these things about people being exploited, the particular examples we get here are meant to give us the idea that food is so expensive that people can't afford it. Right? So a denarius is. Was one day's wages."}

A lot of people didn't work for a wage there. Huge swath of people, subsistence farming. But for people who work for a wage and who then use that wage to go and get food and the other things they needed in the marketplace, a denarius was one day's wage. So if you think about, you could get a quart of wheat for one day's wage. You have to work all day just to get a quart of wheat. You have no money for anything else now, right. So this is the idea behind the scales, and this being shouted vis a vis the marketplace is that this isn't just to represent, like, oh, yeah, you're going to have bad crops for a couple years, but that. That's going to produce a chain reaction that's going to destroy the markets, the economy that existed at the time."}

So this is describing, like the Great Depression, its ancient equivalent, right. Where it's going to reach and touch everybody. Right. And famine can be a force for a kind of justice in the same way that we were just talking about violence being right, in the sense that, well, this innocent person was murdered and so now the murderer is dead too, which is a kind of justice. Not the ideal form, but a kind of it. In the same way the people who have oppressed the poor, deprived them of their wages, profited off of their hunger, oppressed the orphan and the widow, when this happens, everyone is affected. They don't have any food either. Right. Those who had become rich and wealthy. And so there's sort of an equalizer of outright famine like this describes that hits everyone. Right. And so there's a sort of justice to those who have oppressed and starved the poor now starving themselves. Not the ideal kind of justice, but a kind nonetheless. And not only is Ramon seen as being part of Moat's retinue, but especially in the prophet Jeremiah, you see him pair together famine and the sword, sometimes famine and the sword and plague. Right. All three together, often just famine and the sword. Some examples. I will Van Impe them again. And these are all Hebrew references. I'm not going to list both references."}

Jeremiah 2, verse 34, verse 10, 5, verse 12, 9, verse 16, 14, verses 12 through 16, 15, verses 2 and 3, 16, verse 4, 21, verses 7 through 9, 24, verse 10, 25, verse 16 and 27 through 29, 32, verses 24 through 26, 42, verses 16 through 22 and 44, 12, 18 are some examples. Right. And what these examples have in common is that they present famine and the sword, and where it's also added pestilence or disease or plague as being these kind of spiritual forces that are unleashed by Yahweh, the God of Israel, as a form of judgment. And that's unleashed in a very literal sense. They're often portrayed as sort of these beasts that accompany him who he has on a leash. Right. Think of the Satan in Job, right? He wants to do stuff to Job. He has to kind of get permission. And then he's given limits, right?"}

At least he'll restrain them less, he'll let them come into our lives, our families, our tribe, nation, whatever, in order to bring about that repentance that so far we have not, we have not shown. And a good example of that dynamic of God sort of unleashing these forces out of the world to go bring about justice. And one that sort of clearly prefigures what St. John is doing with the Four Horsemen is actually in Zechariah 6:1:8."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #072 - 2023-07-27 - Bad Boys of the Apocalypse","start":5554.86,"end":5641.5,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Yeah. So this is kind of the first appearance of the four horsemen, although a little different. Little different. So starting with verse one again, I lifted my eyes and saw. And behold, four chariots came out from between two mountains, and the mountains were mountains of bronze. The first chariot had red horses, the second, black horses, the third, white horses. And the fourth chariot, dappled horses, all of them strong. Then I answered and said to the angel who talked with me, what are these, my lord? And the angel answered and said to me, these are going out to the four winds of heaven. After presenting themselves before the Lord of all the earth. The chariot with the black horses goes toward the north country. The white ones go after them, and the dappled ones go toward the south country. When the strong horses came out, they were impatient to go and patrol the earth. And he said, go patrol the earth. So they patrolled the earth. Then he cried to me, behold, those who go toward the north country have set my spirit at rest in the north country. So it's chariots in this case that seem to have multiple horses each, but the colors are there. Again, dappled instead of pale. Colors are always kind of an iffy question in the ancient world, but in ancient texts. But. Yeah, so, but."}

They're sent into the north, and then once they're done, God's spirit is at rest in the north. They've taken care of the issue. Right. The judgment has taken place. So these powers, right? Moat and his. And his pals, right. Mote himself was not sort of worshiped or invoked in the ancient world because you just wanted to keep death away from you, mostly."}

All of these forces are controlled by Yahweh, the God of Israel. Right. In the Old Testament. It's not that they're not forces. It's not that they're not demonic. It's not that they're some kind of materialist function of something or other. Right. But they're controlled by Yahweh, the God of Israel.

And so what St. John is doing here with the Four Horsemen, and which he does again and again in the book of Revelation, he has the same kind of idea when they open the abyss. There's lots and lots of imagery over and over again in the different cycles of the Book of Revelation of this. But that at the end, as we're approaching the final judgment, Right. When things will finally all be set, Right. When justice will finally prevail, that as the time of God's patience comes to an end in favor of justice, that there will be this kind of final unleashing of these powers. Right. Where God will remove the restraints, remove sort of the protection that we've had from the consequences of our own actions up till that point. There's this final unleashing, and that's to bring about a great final repentance before the end. Right. This is sort of the last shot. Right. So the reason why the scriptures again portray things as getting really, really bad right before the end is that God intends things getting really, really bad to be this last final call to repentance before it's too late. Because it's the repentance that he wants to see, and it's because it's the repentance that he wants to see that we see with the Four Horsemen. Even with the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, there are still limits."}

They do show up at other points. But there's other figures that we want to discuss, too.

The word of the Lord came to me, Son of man, set your face toward Gog of the land of Magog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal, and prophesy against him and say, thus says the Lord God. Behold, I am against you, O Gog, chief prince of Meshech and Tubal. And I will turn you about and put hooks into your jaws, and I will bring you out and all your army, horses and horsemen, all of them clothed in full armor, a great host, all of them with buckler and shield wielding swords. Persia, Cush and put are with them. All of them with shield and helmet, Gomer and all his hordes, Beth, Togarmah, from the uttermost parts of the north, with all his hordes. Many peoples are with you. Be ready and keep ready, you and all your hosts that are assembled about you, and be a guard for them. After many days, you will be mustered. In the latter years, you will Go against the land that is restored from war, the land whose people were gathered from many peoples upon the mountains of Israel, which had been a continual waste. Its people were brought out from the peoples and now dwell securely all of them. You will advance, coming on like a storm. You will be like a cloud covering the land, you and all your hordes and many peoples with you. Thus says the Lord God, on that day, thoughts will come into your mind, and you will devise an evil scheme and say, I will go up against the land of unwalled villages. I will fall upon the quiet people who dwell securely, all of them dwelling without walls and having no bars or gates to seize spoil and carry off plunder, to turn your hand against the waste places that are now inhabited, and the people who are gathered from the nations, who have acquired livestock, stock and goods, who dwell at the center of the earth, Sheba and Dedan and the merchants of Tarshish and all its leaders will say to you, have you come to seize spoil? Have you assembled your hosts to carry off plunder, to carry away silver and gold, to take away livestock and goods, to seize great spoil? Therefore, son of man, prophesy and say to Gog, thus says the Lord. On that day when my people Israel are dwelling securely, will you not know it? You will come from your place out of the uttermost parts of the north, you and many peoples with you, all of them riding on horses, a great host, a mighty army. You will come up against my people Israel, like a cloud covering the land. In the latter day I will bring you against my land, that the nations may know me when through you, O Gog, I vindicate my holiness before their eyes. Thus says the Lord God, are you he of whom I spoke in former days by my servants, the prophets of Israel, who in those days prophesied for years that I would bring you against them. But on that day, the day that Gog shall come against the land of Israel, declares the Lord God, my wrath will be roused in my anger, for in my jealousy and in my blazing wrath I declare on that day there shall be a great earthquake in the land of Israel. The fish of the sea and the birds of the heavens, and the beasts of the field, and all creeping things that creep on the ground. And all the people who are on the face of the earth shall quake at my presence, and the mountains shall be thrown down, and the cliffs shall fall, and every wall shall tumble to the ground. I will summon a sword against Gog on all my mountains, declares the Lord God. Every man's Sword will be against his brother. With pestilence and bloodshed, I will enter into judgment with him. And I will rain upon him and his hordes and the many peoples who are with him. Torrential rains and hailstones, fire and sulfur. So I will show my greatness and my holiness and make myself known in the eyes of many nations. Then they will know that I am the Lord. Sounds like a pulp Fiction ending there."}

So it's not clear exactly when people started saying Gog and Magog, but we find it in some of the Dead Sea Scrolls, we find it in some other Second Temple literature. And so that was already an established usage by the time. And we're going to get to it in the Book of revelation, when St. John refers to Gog and Magog, that and had already been around for a couple of centuries. Right.

Right. And that coalition of nations, it's not like a group of nations that are next to each other because it includes Kush and Put, which are African nations. It includes Persia. Right. It includes Gomer. Right. And these are all different directions from Israel. And the conquest that's talked about goes as far as, like, Tarshish, which is in what's now Spain, and Sheba and Dedan, which is down at the end of the Arabian Peninsula. Right. So we're covering all the compass directions. Right. Like, sort of the whole known world is involved with this, even though Gog and his armies are said to come from the north, which is one of the things that indicates to us that this is the sacred geography. Direction north, the place of evil, where."}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #072 - 2023-07-27 - Bad Boys of the Apocalypse","start":6774.83,"end":6872.4,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"So, yeah. So there is even within this. Right. Clues that people should take, even though a lot of modern people haven't taken them, that this is not just talking, not intended to be literally referring to a particular king at the time of Ezekiel who had actually put together this precise coalition, etc. Etc. Right. And in the response, in God's response, in his judgment, you see that God responds by sort of unleashing demonic powers, like the ones we were just talking about. Like in verse 21, when God says, I will summon a sword against Gog on all my mountains. Right. That he's sort of unleashing these demonic powers on Gog himself. Right. As a response to justice against Gog's injustice. So in trying to work out who exactly Gog is and where exactly Magog is, right. From people who are taking the approach of, we need to match this up to a place or just, hey, let's look at the other places where these terms are used in scripture. Right. Try to understand how these things connect. The main place where Magog is referenced in scripture other than this is in Genesis, chapter 10 in the table of nations."}

And so in trying to figure out what the Gog in Magog and Gog would be referring to, the best. And I think still pretty unconvincing argument that people have come up with is that it might be referring to Gyges, who was the first sort of imperial king of Lydia. There were kings of Lydia before him in Asia Minor, but he was the first one to really sort of become a world stage player and start to expand his territory. That was in the 7th century BC. So we're about a century before Ezekiel. So it's not impossible. But obviously he can't be referring to that person as historical person because he's dead."}

Might have been using Gyges, this King Gyges, as a type. Right. As a representative of this Gog person. Sort of the way when we talked about, in the Antichrist episode, when we talked about how you have Antichrist, you have individual people like Nero, who are sort of an image of this, a representative of this. But you can't get Ezekiel's prophecy to be addressing the historical Gyges because it doesn't work out. Chronology, Right? Now, when you get into our earliest known interpretation of this, of who. Who this Gog is. Right. So now we talked about other places where these words show up in the scriptures outside the Hebrew scriptures. The earliest interpretation we get is actually since we're talking about a prophecy of Ezekiel. Ezekiel is living during the exile. So in the middle of the 6th century BC the earliest interpretation of this that we get isn't in Second Temple Jewish literature. It's in the Greek translations of the Hebrew scriptures."}

And so our earliest commentary are various Greek passages, some of which refer to Gog in the Greek tradition that don't, at least obviously, in the Hebrew, in the original Hebrew. And what that shows us is that the person translating them into Greek was aware of traditions concerning Gog, who Gog was, that existed at the time that the Greek was being translated and considered those to be the correct way of reading and interpreting the text. Right. These translators didn't sit down and decide, I'm going to change this text."}

You only notice it if you actually sit down and compare these things. You know, you look at what it says in the. Even in translations, you know, a translation of the Hebrew and a translation of the Greek, and you start to notice, like, wait a minute, this is not just like, synonyms or whatever, but there are other words here that are not in the other one. Or there's, you know, some words that are not in the later version that are in the earlier one. And that's what this case like. So if you look at a translation of the Hebrew of Amos 7:1, it's a longer verse than the Greek translation from, you know, from. From the. The BC period. So, yeah, Amos 7:1. So first I'm going to read the ESV. So this is looking at Hebrew texts and translating them. This is what the Lord God showed me. Behold, he was forming locusts when the latter growth was just beginning to sprout. And behold, it was the latter growth after the king's Mowings. King's mowings.

And for all of you vampire people out there, or vampire interested People hope you're not vampire people. Vampire interested people. The. The word vrujos, meaning locust, comes from the Greek verb vriko. Vriko, which means to eat greedily. And we all remember the vricolakas from one of our Halloween episodes. So there you go.

Sometimes there are places where the Hebrew and Greek differ. And if you know both languages, you could kind of look at the. Especially the Hebrew. You could look at the Hebrew and be like, oh, well, they read that this way, right? You like, you could tell, right? Or they. This word could mean two different things. They chose this other one. Right. You could find a lot of those things. Heck, I'll give an example. There's a place in the book of Jonah where in the Hebrew, when the guys on the boat in the storm ask Jonah who he is, he says, I am a Hebrew, which is Ivri in Hebrew. That's how you say Hebrew in Hebrew, Ivri. And if you look at the Greek there, they ask him who he is, and Jonah says that he is servant of the Lord. Right. Those don't look like at all unless you know that Ivri and his servant or slave in Hebrew, Evad yah, look almost identical in Hebrew if you don't have vowels. The only real difference is that translating it as Hebrew means that you see a resh there, an R sound, and translating it as servant of the Lord means you saw a dalet there, which makes a D sound. And the difference between a resh and a dalet in Hebrew is literally a little tiny leg sticking out of one letter. Right? So it is. There aren't two letters that close to each other in English that I could use it as an example. It's like a tiny little piece. So you can figure it out. Right? But there. There is no figuring out. Amos 7, verse 1."}

Which means the only way that can get in there is if it was sort of common knowledge to the translator that, oh, this is talking about Gog, why would he think this is talking about Gog? Right. Well, there are some other places. Right. So remember, Amos is what we call in English Bible, usually one of the minor prophets. And historically, Amos is part of the book of the 12.

And so the translator is reflecting in Amos 7, verse 1 in the Greek translation, this tradition of understand of Gog's locust army from the north. Right. Which is how these prophetic texts were being interpreted at the time he did the translation.

And if there's any doubt in your mind that it's talking about the Amalekites, if you go a few verses later in the same prophecy by Balaam, he goes straight to talking about the Amalekites.

Josephus does not relate this to Magog, but also In Josephus, he has a story about Alexander the Great having an iron gate that he built to hold back a particular tribe of Scythians. Not in the context of Magog being the Scythians. Right. In two different places. The reason that I bring that up, though is that when you get a little later. Well, a lot later in this case to the Syriac legend of Alexander the Great, now you have this sort of full blown tradition that Alexander made this gate and put spells and magic whammy on it to hold back Gog and Magog."}

Pseudo Methodius, a little later in the seventh century, tells a version of the story where he adds this element where. Right. Well, this gate, like, what's it attached to? Right. So you can see how these things could develop. Right. You've got to kind of then explain. So the story gets elaborated a little more to explain things.

And that was. That was at Mount Sinai. That was sort of the archetypal. That's what made Amalek and the Amalekites sort of the archetypal enemy even among the giant clans. Right. And so the imagery that we get in Revelation is similar. Right. That Gog assembles the nations of the world. Right. Persia put. Right. All over the place. Right. Gathers them all together to face off against who? Remember our Greek tradition in Balaam, against the Messiah and his kingdom. Right. The Messiah being the one who rules from the mountain of God. So this is a parallel there. And so the use in Revelation, I would argue, is another paralleling of Gog from Magog with this tradition. Right. And with the giant imagery. Right. We can say, is Gog here the devil himself? Is it a human sort of motivated and acted on and through by the devil, like, say, Judas? Right. And the answer is yes."}

Well, to wrap up this episode, this eschatological episode of the Lord of Spirits, one of the questions that I think is paramount, really, like, it's the main thing we should be asking as we look at the Scriptures, as we read the teachings of the Fathers, as we listen to. To experience and participate in the divine services and so on and so on, is what is the purpose of this within the Christian life?"}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #072 - 2023-07-27 - Bad Boys of the Apocalypse","start":9516.27,"end":9516.67,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Right."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #072 - 2023-07-27 - Bad Boys of the Apocalypse","start":9517.55,"end":10101.69,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"I know a lot of people were. Had a lot of anticipation for this, for this episode of our listeners, and even for other parts of this series, because it's really. I mean, it's some very interesting stuff, right? It's. It's really just intellectually stimulating. You know, the four Horsemen, the Antichrist, all this kind of stuff. It's. It's very, very intriguing. And, you know, it's good, like, to be intellectually stimulated and to be intrigued and to be interested and to want to know and to understand and explore and, you know, play with and. And all that kind of stuff. But again, the point is, why is this given for us? Right. The Scriptures are not written for our intellectual curiosity. Even though I'm a big believer in intellectual curiosity, they're not written for that purpose. The tradition of the Church in general is not given to us for that purpose. It's given to us. All these things are given to us so that we might believe that Jesus is the Christ and that believing in him, we might have life in his name, to use the words of the apostle and Evangelist John. So then what do all of these bad guys of the Apocalypse, right, the four Horsemen, Gog and Magog, of course, the accompanying swarms of locusts, what does that mean for us in particular? You know, it's not just about being right or wrong about these things or having a colorful depiction of the end. It's about what do we do with that. And I think there's a number of things that we could say about that. One of the themes that we've talked about a number of times on the podcast is this theme of what we call the left hand of God. To use some of the language that you see in the. The Books of Kings, where there's the elect, the obedient angels at the right hand of God and then the disobedient at the left hand, meaning the demons. And how they, while they do their own will, they end up doing God's will. And we talked about that a bunch of times in this episode, especially that the Four Horsemen and these other demonic figures are kind of on a leash. And sometimes they are un leashed, let go, having been restrained but under limits and then brought back that kind of thing. And I mean, it is quite simply so that we might repent. Part of the genesis of this podcast some three years ago was when Fr. Stephen and I appeared on Fr. Tom Sirocca's show, Ancient Faith Today Live. And the question was asked, is the pandemic judgment from God? Right? And of course we both said, yes, it is, meaning that, you know, judgment is God establishing his justice. And so the pandemic was an opportunity for us to repent. And of course, you know, Reshef, right, this pestilence, God is one of the four Horsemen involved in any kind of mass outbreak of disease. So there is on that level, right, suffering and so forth is an opportunity for us to repent both in our personal lives, right, our own individual personal lives, like my participation in the divine services, in prayer, in almsgiving, in. In active love, in self sacrifice, all that kind of stuff. But also on the larger scale of, okay, how am I helping to make the world a more beautiful, more just better, kinder place? Like, what am I doing to help address the ills of the world? What am I doing to make things right? It doesn't matter if I was the one who made them wrong or not. If I see someone near me suffering, it doesn't matter if I'm the one who caused the suffering. Now I might well have been maybe deliberately, maybe through neglect, who knows, maybe just the fact that I'm a sinner has this spiritual effect. But repentance, we can repent on our own behalf in terms of putting our own souls right, but also repent on behalf of the world in which we live, putting the world right. And I'm not talking about, you know, like, I am out there to change the world kind of stuff, which I don't know what anybody means by that anymore. I'm going to make a difference. Whatever, okay, it's not bad language. I'm just not sure what it's supposed to mean now. But you can make things better where you are. You can serve the people near you, whether it's your family or your friends. Or your co workers or your fellow parishioners. I mean, parishes really should be doing this for the parish and for anyone who comes to the parish. Right. But also, there's another side to this, which is, you might ask, like, well, okay, God's unleashing demons again. He's letting them do, like, God is not doing evil things, but he's allowing. He's removing his protection from these evil spirits doing their evil things. What about people who seem to be suffering unjustly? You know, is God saying, you're bad and so you need to shape up? I mean, we've all, I'm sure, seen or at least heard of some unjust suffering, right? Whether it's mass disease invasion, you know, individual people suffering from serious health problems or other kinds of suffering in their life, you know, whatever it might be. Why do these things happen? Is God, you know, is God smacking them down? Is God telling them you're bad, you know, so get better, right? Not necessarily. I mean, it might be. It might be, but not necessarily. We all remember, and I think we've mentioned this on the podcast before, but it is worth repeating. St. Paul talks about having been sent an angel of Satan, a messenger of Satan, as often gets translated, but a demon that tormented him. We don't know exactly what experience he was having that he described in that way. There's various ideas about that. But he's the one who said that it was this evil spirit. And he asks God three times to take it away. And God says, no, my grace is sufficient for you. Why would God do that? It was St. Paul, this unrighteous, evil man, that needed this in order to shape up. No, he's a righteous man, certainly by this point, one of the holiest people ever lived. But the experience that he had was so that he might gain even more of the grace of God. As God said, my grace is sufficient for you so that he might advance even more in holiness. Because repentance is not only to undo some bad thing that you did or even that someone else did, that certainly is included in repentance, but it is also to undo any imperfection. It is also to advance towards being more like Christ, to become more worthy of being adopted as sons of God. Right? So there is an advancement. Repentance is not just to set things back to zero. It's actually to move positively above that, to grow past that. Right? And the experiences of suffering, demonic suffering that we have are an opportunity for that. Often we are tempted, and understandably so, to say, why God? Why even Job? Said, why God? Why right now? He was able to do that without sinning, which super hard for me. I don't think I could manage it. But one of the answers to why God, why? I'm not saying it's the only one. I'm speaking in general, not in particular, but in general. One of the answers is so that I might have an opportunity to become holier. You know, it's not only to deal with some sin, it is also to advance in holiness. And so when we consider this rogues gallery of demonic bad guys, at the end, this is how we should receive this. Not just say, oh, that's cool and weird and whatever, scary. But like, okay, these things are put in front of me so that I might learn repentance even more, or maybe start or maybe restart whatever is applicable for me. So that's one way that I'm receiving what we talked about tonight."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #072 - 2023-07-27 - Bad Boys of the Apocalypse","start":10106.41,"end":10654.88,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"So I want to build a little off of what Father Andrew was just talking about. And he was talking about sort of wrapping our intellect around the shape of life in the world as we live in it, and finding meaning and growing in holiness. I want to focus on the fact that you can choose to be invincible. You can choose to live your life in a way where no one will ever be able to hurt you, let alone do any harm to you, let alone damage you. This isn't like a one time choice that you make, like, okay, yeah, that sounds good, I'll choose that. This is something that we have to practice choosing over and over and over again. And the way it works is revealed in some of the stories in scripture and things that we talked about in this episode. One of the examples we used as we read a little piece of sort of the deliberations among Joseph's brothers when they were trying to decide whether to kill him or just throw him down a well and ultimately to sell him into slavery in Egypt. At the end of that story, of course, when they realize that their brother is alive, that their brother now has the power of life and death over them in Egypt, they're terrified, and rightfully so. And Joseph says to them, you meant it to me for evil, but God meant it for good. And by that he means they were trying to do evil to their brother Joseph. But God had brought good out of it. God had put Joseph into the position to be able to save the lives of his whole family through it. And that dynamic is at the core, of course, of what we've been talking about tonight with these demonic spiritual powers who mean only evil for Us don't make that mistake. They only want to destroy humanity. They only want to do us harm. But who God allows to, at some times and in some places, to try to do some of that harm in order that he can bring good out of it. And one of the chief ways is, as Father Andrew said, through inspiring repentance. But choosing how we're going to receive things and what we're going to do with them is a freedom that we have in Christ when we are slaves to sin. The Orthodox Church, we commonly call the sins passions because they make us passive. They take control of us. So greed takes control of you. Anger takes control of you. Lust takes control of you. Laziness takes control of you. Pride takes control of you. All of these things, once they get control of you, will cause you to do things that in another moment, on another day, at another time, you would have thought were unthinkable. But when you're in the grip of sin, you start doing them. And so when we're bound by sin, we're not free. But when Christ has set us free from sin, we now have freedom not to just react. We have freedom not to just be passive. We're free to always and at every moment to be active in the world. And so that means when someone just outright insults me, right? Not remotely trying to offer a morsel of constructive criticism, just outright insults me, says things designed to hurt me, I have a choice to make. I have a choice to make. I could choose to give in to anger. I can choose to retaliate. I could choose to receive that insult and have it foster humility in me. When someone offers me something that may be sideways could be taken as constructive criticism. I can make the choice to receive it as constructive criticism, regardless of how it was intended. I could use it to improve. I can use it to repent or to change, or to work harder, or to see something I didn't see before about myself or about the people around me, or to make something right that I've done wrong. These things can bring me to repentance. These things can increase my patience and my resolve. When I get sick, I can use that, too. It's funny how often I pray when I'm sick to be healthy again, and how little I pray to thank God that I'm healthy. When I'm healthy, I can use it to help me understand my own weakness and dependence on others. I can use it to develop empathy for other people who are suffering the same things. That's true even for the most horrible thing that could possibly happen to me. Whatever that thing would be, it's happened to other people and is happening to other people. Other people who need compassion and who need empathy and who need someone to help them through those difficulties. If we become consistent in making those choices, we become invincible. No one can harm us. No one can hurt us. Whatever anyone does to us, no matter how evil, no matter how motivated by evil, ends up working to our good, up to and including if we're ready to die. If we're ready to die because we've been living our life following Christ, they can't even do us harm by murdering us. You can become invulnerable to harm if we start to practice these things. But this isn't how we've been taught to live our lives. And it isn't how we've been taught to see ourselves. We haven't been taught by the world to eat curses and spit blessings back out toward the people who threw them at us. Right. We've been taught to lament how unjust it is that we were cursed. We've been taught that the problem in the world is that I'm a righteous person who's suffering. I'm not a righteous person, and that's not why I'm suffering. But we've been taught to look at ourselves that way. The problem is the bad things happening to me, not the way I'm living my life and the choices I'm making and how to receive the things of life. We've been taught essentially to see ourselves and to act and behave as victims continuously. And a victim, being a victim perpetually is the opposite of being invincible. It's the opposite of being unable to be harmed. And so to me, this is the really important, the really important practice that we can derive from these things that we've been talking about. There's too much of our lives that's consumed by fear. Fear of being hurt, fear of struggle, fear of criticism, fear of the opinions of other people. There's too much of our life that's spent nursing old wounds. There's too much of our life that's spent wanting people to treat us the way other people, or life itself, or even, dare I say God, to treat us the way we think we deserve to be treated and nowhere near enough time spent turning the way life does treat us to good and getting ourselves into a position where, in and with Christ, we are victorious over all of the troubles that come to us in this life."}
