The modern world doesn't acknowledge, but is nevertheless haunted by spirits and angels, demons and saints. In our time, many yearn to break free of the prison of a flat secular materialism, to see and to know reality as it truly is. What is this spiritual reality like? How do we engage with it? Well, how do we permeate everyday life with spiritual presence? Orthodox Christian priests Father Andrew Stephen Damick and Fr.

Death is what brought Christ into the underworld to destroy the power of death and the devil. But why was that? Death through crucifixion, in particular? What is it about the cross? Why did Jesus choose to give up his life in this manner, in particular? So that's where we are tonight. So, Father Stephen, did the Romans invent crucifixion? Is this all their idea? No. Oh, okay.

So, you know, the Assyrians, for example, before the Persians, were very creative in ways to do horrible things to people, but they did not have this as a regular method of execution. So that's what we mean when we say the Persians invented it, but the Romans kind of perfected it, meaning they used it constantly on non Romans. It was illegal to crucify a Roman citizen because it was such a horrible way of executing someone. Such a horrible way of dying. Romans got beheaded. That's why St. Peter was crucified, but St. Paul was beheaded because he was a Roman citizen. Beheading was considered more humane."}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #114 - 2025-04-10 - Every Stick of Wood in the Old Testament","start":486.44,"end":570.14,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Right. But crucifixion, as we were saying, this mode of execution that is literally so tortuous and painful that we invented a word to describe the pain, that word being excruciating. And the way it works, as we said, is a person is affixed in such a way that they're in a stress position, meaning they're in. Their body is in a position where it is unable to rest. Right. And in particular, this was generally set up so that the person was unable to flip fully taken a breath without sort of contorting themselves. And so eventually your body will do a lot to try to breathe and try and keep you alive. But eventually, over the course of often two or three days with no water or food hanging on something, the person, eventually their body just gives out. They're unable to get into a position where they can breathe and they die of asphyxiation."}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #114 - 2025-04-10 - Every Stick of Wood in the Old Testament","start":580.82,"end":662.51,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Yeah. Pretty early on we just went right into this. But okay. Yeah. And so that. That is how. That is how people died. But being in a stress position like that is a form of torture in and of itself. Right. So it's not just things were pretty horrible for a couple days and then they died. It is two to three days of just constant physical and mental torture until you're like your whole system finally gives out. Added to that is the fact that the Romans in particular used this as a deterrent. So it was also a form of public humiliation. People were crucified naked and publicly along roads, along thoroughfares. So it could serve as a deterrent to crime or rebellion or whatever it was that was being punished. And they often. Well, that's what's going on with what's called the titulus in Latin, the sign that Pontius Pilate has put over Christ's cross, declaring him to be the King of the Jews."}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #114 - 2025-04-10 - Every Stick of Wood in the Old Testament","start":666.27,"end":705.52,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"The idea is this is a way of mocking someone and also sending a message to any other would be messiahs out there who might see it that this is what's in store for you. The Romans also, and very perversely Roman soldiers who are assigned to this task of executing people were very creative and inventive in how they would do it. So we hear these stories about certain saints being crucified on their sides, or St. Peter being crucified upside down, or St. Andrew's Cross being like an axe and different things. That's all very real. Romans did that kind of thing all the time."}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #114 - 2025-04-10 - Every Stick of Wood in the Old Testament","start":708,"end":853.28,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Just to. I guess they got bored executing people because sometimes crosses were used for max executions. For example, Spartacus's slave revolt ended with Spartacus and all of his men being crucified. So because they were slaves, not Roman citizens, they could be. They could be crucified. So you can imagine the soldiers assigned this duty. It's a grisly duty. It's a horrible duty. And it's the kind of doing this kind of duty is the kind of thing that coarsens and hollows out a person to the point where they would start to find things funny like crucifying someone upside down and this sort of thing. But that was very much the Case among the Romans. Pontius Pilate in particular, as governor of Judea, was a big fan of using crucifixion as a tool for population control. Basically, as governor, Pontius Pilate was assigned to keep the peace in the Roman province of Judea. That was his whole job, right? Just keep the peace. And in order to do that, he could do just about anything he wanted to to the local population, especially if they weren't Roman citizens. If they were Roman citizens, he had some more rules he had to follow. But if they're not Roman citizens, no one cared. They're essentially considered like animals. And so no one cared what you did to them. And of course, if he failed to keep the peace in Judea, he would be the one getting beheaded. Right? He'd be the one getting executed. And that's ultimately what happened to him when he was recalled to Rome. But he got a bum assignment in that regard, in that during the first century, especially the mid first century A.D. there were almost constant would be messiahs and Jewish revolts breaking out, culminating in what happened in A.D. 70, and then the Bar Kokva rebellion later on."}

To that end, he did a lot of things that now are very clearly atrocities to us, but that the Romans thought nothing of."}

In Luke 13, Christ refers to some Jewish people whose blood was mingled with the sacrifices by Pilate. And you said, well, what's that about? That is at a previous Passover in the early 20s, word Passover, there's all of these thousands and thousands of pilgrims coming to Jerusalem from all over the world for the feast. And Pilate got word that there was going to be some kind of issue, someone was going to try to start a rebellion. There was some would be Messiah going to try and start something. And so as the time was approaching, he decided to head that off of the pass. He grabbed 150 random Jewish men, women and children off the streets literally at random, and crucified them, men, women and children along all the roads leading into Jerusalem. So the pilgrims would walk past them all on the way into the city to send them the message not to cause any trouble."}

That was good tactics from the perspective of Roman Governors, we don't appreciate how little the pre Christian pagan world looked like our world a lot of the time, and just how monstrous it was. But that's, that's the kind of guy who Pilate was. When you read skeptical scholars talking about the stories of Christ's crucifixion in the Gospels, the thing that they find unrealistic is that Pilate gave him a trial."}

They're like, why would he bother talking to him right now? I think that's answered by what we find in the Gospels, that his wife had had this dream, because as brutal as the Romans could be, they were also incredibly superstitious about omens and dreams and things."}

Don't do anything to him because it'll go badly for you. He would take that very seriously. At least seriously enough to exchange, you know, a few sentences with the person in the crowd. Right. It's not like he gave him a real trial. Right. But that gives you an idea of the kind of person Pilot was."}

This is of course what happens. What happens to Christ. He is crucified by Pontius Pilate, by the Romans. But in terms of understanding what's going on with crucifixion and Christ's crucifixion in particular, the New Testament authors especially, but not only St. Paul, go back to the Torah and they go back to Deuteronomy chapter 21, which is, I know, everyone's favorite chapter of Deuteronomy where it's talking about capital punishment."}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #114 - 2025-04-10 - Every Stick of Wood in the Old Testament","start":1104.52,"end":1174.83,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"So Deuteronomy 21 chapter or chapter 21, verses 22 and 23 are going to talk about another mode of execution, but previous to that, it's talking about stoning things when someone is going to be stoned to death, which was the normal method in which if an execution had to be performed in Israel, that it was performed. And we see that continue obviously into the New Testament with, for example, St. Stephen, with St. Paul a couple of times. The reason for that is that that is a mode of execution that can be sort of brought about by mob violence. Like you can use it as a quasi judicial mode of execution. It doesn't require any specialized equipment or hardware or anything. But you could also just get a mob to do it, which is how it works with like St. Stephen. You have St. Paul, inciting a mob."}

Mobs sort of get incited to go after him and do it. But Deuteronomy is the rules for when it's carried out. Right. Because of a situation where someone has violated certain commandments of the Torah that call for death is completely unrepentant and sort of exile isn't a reasonable possibility."}

That's what people. Substitutionary atonement said. And like we said last time, if you don't believe that, you don't actually believe in penal substitutionary atonement.

Because sometimes, Sometimes. And I don't know how to characterize this, I'm sorry, except as a kind of soft ecumenism. Right. There are folks even within the Orthodox Church who will try to say, well, can't we say that we believe da, da, da, da, da, like kind of, you know, like trying to offer an olive branch either to Roman Catholicism or Protestantism on some topic or some form of Protestantism or some form of evangelicalism. You know, like, we could kind of say that, you know, this is true. You know, and it amounts to. We can agree on these words as long as we just mean two totally different things by them. And I don't know what the value of that kind of ecumenism is. Right. Like, okay, we agreed on some wording that we're both going to read in completely different ways and act like, what, what did we accomplish here? We're just, we're nice people.

They're much nicer people than me. They're trying to be nice. They're trying not to, you know, come down on other people. And that's okay. Right. To be nice. I guess. Not for me. But you miss something critical. There's something really critical in how the New Testament talks about Christ's crucifixion and death and atonement in general and all these things when you do that. Because the language that's used in the New Testament is not language of substitution, it's language of participation. And those are two very different things. An example that is right on point."}

It's talking about God bringing Israel back from the dead. That's what it's talking about. But we read it there because Christ's resurrection is the beginning of the resurrection of God's people. It's the first fruits, which is the beginning of the resurrection of the whole cosmos."}

The atonement ritual in the Old Testament was done as, like, a mitigation person had to be done each year. And it was not just for the sins, but it was for the stain and effects of sin. And because of this, the fact that they had to repeat it, they were anticipating. And you guys described how they were anticipating this. In the Apocalypse of Abraham, there being a cosmic atonement in which the sin problem is finally solved once and for all. So that being the understanding if Christ saving acts on the cross and his resurrection do actually represent this, like, final solution to the problem, then, like, how does that apply to our lives in the Christian era on a personal level, but also on a sort of theological basis. You know, I was baptized in the Orthodox Church, but I still sin. And I'm not saying, obviously, my baptism worked. It was canonical and everything, but it's not as though, like, I'm.

I mean, the way that I understand it, which I don't know that this is necessarily the best way of expressing it, but I know that Father Stephen will just actually me if I get anything wrong or incomplete here, so that's, that's cool. Is that it's. So the. This cosmic atonement has happened and is happening, right? So there is a cleansing of the whole creation that has occurred such that we no longer have to do rituals to push sin outside of the camp. Now, in some sense, the universe is the camp, right? But we still sin, just as the people of Israel still sinned, even when the atonement had occurred. And so there are. I mean, there are echoes in a sense of this, right? So we still use incense for purification. We still bless homes, we still bless our churches, even because of the same kind of dynamic occurs. But what has changed is that it is now possible to defeat sin in a way that was not possible before, right? And also, of course, you know, theosis is possible for us in Christ in a way that without his. His sacrifice and resurrection, it was not before. But it's. I don't know. I think a. Both now and not yet is the way that I kind of understand what's happening in this Messianic age. It's."}

Yeah, right, but so there's a fundamental difference between what you experience when you go to confession and what the ancient Israelite experienced when they brought a sin offering.

Saint Athanasius says when he's explaining the crucifixion, that the devil wanders about our lower atmosphere and tries to hinder them that are going up and further. The Lord came to cast down the devil and clear the air and prepare the way for us up into heaven. And then in the Life of Anthony, he relates a vision that Anthony had of looking up, looking up in the air and air, someone being born upwards. This is regarded the passing from death to life of a monk, Adam. Later, he writes about Anthony's vision of himself that a certain bitter and terrible being stood in the air and wished to hinder him from passing through. So given this and other things, many other things about the crucifixion, is one to understand that Christ being lifted up was victorious as subduing aerial spirits, thereby opening up the way for us up to heaven. Is that the way I should look at that?"}

John's Gospel in particular. Christ uses that language over and over again to refer to his crucifixion. When I am lifted up, right? When I'm lifted up, I'll draw all men to myself, right? That's why it always cracks me up when I hear those evangelical hymns with choruses that are like, lift him up. And I'm like, oh, yeah, maybe you want to look at how that's used in Scripture, right. And so there isn't. There is an element of that, right. And you'll find in the Fathers, you'll find meditations on this in particular, when they're talking about the shape of the cross, particularly the vertical axis, right? They'll talk about the vertical axis of the cross, of the horizontal axis of the cross, right? Where the vertical axis is going, it's, you know, in the ground, like the underworld, and then up into the air. And then the horizontal axis of the cross is going, you know, to the east and to the west, right. To the ends, Right. Toward the end of the earth, right? And they connect this to the idea. And we use this on Feast of the Cross, we use the solemn verse, he has wrought salvation in the midst of the earth."}

And that in the midst of the earth is literally in the middle, the center, right? And this has to do with Jerusalem being the navel of the world, right? Like it's the sort of dead center. And then you have this cross that has this vertical axis and this horizontal axis. And so they'll connect the crucifixion to Christ, uniting not just the earth and the heavens, but even the underworld, even Sheol or Hades, the grave, to the heavens, right. He who descended also ascended. So he'd fill all things, as St. Paul says, right? Same St. Paul who calls the devil the prince and power of the air. So the idea is that Christ is crucified sort of in this center point of the whole creation."}

That's what we celebrate. We're about to celebrate at Pascha. But it's Passover language. And Passover was about what it was about a bunch of slaves in Egypt being set free. So this is the primary metaphor. The atonement stuff is there. Christ is both goats, but this is more primary. And so if your view of the atonement does not hold this as primary, there's a problem with your view of the atonement. But we have to understand how slavery worked in the ancient world, specifically the ancient near east, there were two kinds of slaves and indentured servants. One was people taken in war and enslaved."}

But it's making this analogy to debt slavery. And part of this analogy is understanding sin as debt. Sin being compared to debt. And that happens a lot. You could probably think of some examples right off the top of your head in the New Testament. But just to throw out a few, of course, Matthew 6, 9, 13, when St. Matthew in his Gospel gives us the Lord's Prayer, he refers to forgiving our debts as we forgive our debtors."}

And it's talking about sin, but it's using the language of debt. And Luke 11, 4, St. Luke has forgive us our trespasses in the Lord's Prayer. But in Luke 11, 4. Christ says, if we do not forgive our debtors, we will not be forgiven. Right. So he uses the same kind of language, just separate from the Lord's Prayer. You can look at Matthew 18, 23, 35, Luke 7, 36, 47. You think about parables like the unmerciful servant, right? This man has his debt forgiven and then goes and is violent towards someone who owes him a much smaller amount."}

Which is, which is why, I mean, it's interesting, sometimes people might say, well, if God forgives my sins, why do I keep sinning? And I mean, to me, one good way of understanding that is like, well, you're in the habit of paying the debt, the debt to sin, which is you're sinning, but you don't have to sin anymore. You don't have to pay the debt anymore."}

Because you are precious in my eyes and honored and I love You, I give men in return for you peoples in exchange for your life. Fear not, for I am with you.

He made him to be a sin offering who knew no sin, or he who knew no sin was made to be a sin offering so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.

And so she has to watch her sons one by one, be tortured to death in front of her to try to get her to violate God's commandments. And she refuses. And so this is important.

Who are also saints in the Orthodox Church, by the way, you could find icons of the Maccabean martyrs. The shrine where their relics were in Antioch was taken over by Christians, and St. John Chrysostom preached sermons there. But so within this martyrdom story, if you read the prayers that are being prayed by the people being tortured to death and by their mother and by Eliezer, the prayers talk about them asking God to receive their. Their deaths, sort of receive their lives that are being taken from them, to receive them as an atoning offering, as a sin offering on behalf of the people of Israel, because they have this awareness that, hey, we're suffering these things. In the case of the Maccabeean murderers, we're suffering these things because of our sins, right? The reason why we have these horrible overlords who are persecuting us and everything is because we have sinned, right? We have done wrong. We have not kept the commandments. We are under the curse of the Torah, right? And so they're asking God to receive their deaths where they're attempting to die faithfully, to receive their deaths as a sin offering, right? And to offer forgiveness to the people and thereby freedom, right, from these overlords. And so this is sort of this understanding of martyrdom. Now, if the Messiah. Right, which is what Christos. Which is what Christ means. He means the Messiah. If the Messiah himself offers his life to God the Father as a sin offering, this would be sort of the sin qua non, the ultimate example of this."}

But my question is about the grammar. I've always been intrigued about the ancient Hebrew. Like the first Hebrew, you used to use, like symbols, and then it kind of evolved. Is there a book that show us the grammar that they used to use back then? Or it was kind of evolved later on. And about the Greek Dionysius Starks did. Was the grammar from Dionysius kind of impose its grammar to the New Testament writers or. It seems a little bit complex for me to go into and study all that with philology and etymology, and I just want to know if any. It seems a little bit misleading sometimes if I go too much into it because it's like a new area by itself. So I don't know if you can comment on that a little bit."}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #114 - 2025-04-10 - Every Stick of Wood in the Old Testament","start":8907.12,"end":9055.7,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Yeah, yeah. So Paleo Hebrew, which is what that's called, has a. Basically a different way of writing, the same Alphabet. It looks very different. Right. So the Hebrew Alphabet you're used to seeing, if you've looked at Hebrew writing, like modern Hebrew or even a biblical Hebrew text, that is actually the Aramaic block lettering. That is an Aramaic writing style, not the way Hebrew was written. Paleo Hebrew is the way Hebrew was written through most of the period of the Old Testament. But that is again, that's a different Alphabet. That's a different writing style. It doesn't really have different grammar. Now, Hebrew grammar in and of itself is a completely different beast than Indo European language grammar. So, like Greek and Latin follow very similar structures, and those are structures that continue to exist in languages like French and Spanish and English even. But Hebrew really doesn't do that. They don't really have verb tenses. There are two things that are called tenses, but there's only two of them, and neither of them has anything to do with time, so either of them could be used. They're called the perfect and the imperfect. That's confusing, too, because that's not what perfect and imperfect mean like in English grammar or Greek grammar. They could be past, present or future, depending on context. So, like, the kind of structures we take for granted in grammars don't exist in Hebrew and most other Semitic languages by the time you get to like Arabic, like especially modern dialects of Arabic. There are things that are a lot closer to the kind of structures we're used to just because of the give and take culturally and the development of languages. But Hebrew in particular, and even into Aramaic and even into Syriac has a very different kind of grammar. And so then that is part of what I'm talking about with the New Testament is there's, there's chunks of the New Testament that the words are Greek and the letters are Greek, but they're using Hebrew and Aramaic grammatical constructions."}

So I've told this story, I think before on the show, that when I was taking classical Greek, I was at a classical Greek graduate seminar. And on the last day, as a prank, the professor handed out some pages from the Gospel of John and the students all freaked out and didn't know what to do. They're like, this isn't Greek because like, it doesn't follow the rules of classical Greek at all, right? I mean, it's Greek words and it's Greek letters. But the grammar St. John uses is mostly Semitic grammatical forms. And so you can verify even by somebody who, you know, wants to buy into this whole Kini Koine Greek thing, that this is a real Greek dialect beyond just the New Testament. Like Wallace, right? Compare Wallace's New Testament Greek grammar, Greek grammar, beyond the basics. Compare his Greek grammar to like Smythe's classical Greek grammar. They're completely different. Like it's like two different languages because it's two different languages. So I've said before, and I'll say again, you can't really understand the New. If you just go and learn classical Greek, you cannot understand the New Testament. You will misunderstand the New Testament over and over and over again. You have to know some Hebrew and, or Aramaic to really understand the New Testament. If you can't do that, then you just need to go and take a look, like I've said tonight several times, take a look at the Old Testament Greek, how they translated the Hebrew into Greek. And you can derive from the Greek Old Testament, you can derive the kind of rules that you need to understand the Greek of the New Testament. But that's kind of an after the fact thing because what you're really learning by looking at the Greek Old Testament is you're really learning Hebrew grammatical principles just through this lens of Greek translation."}

You could just put words near each other. You could put words in different orders. You can move things around. You could have words and phrases that mean two different things, and you could do that on purpose, just kind of mean both of them at the same time. Right. And. And so the Hebrew language has its own beauty in that way. They exploit the ambiguousness of their grammar, but you don't have the kind of precision. So if you try to approach it the way you'd approach Latin, which is a very precise language, that's why it's still used for things like law, like jurisprudence and medical terminology and stuff. Latin is a very precise language. Hebrew is not. And Hebrew authors and poets use that to their advantage, turn that into a. It's more of an artistic language than a precise language."}

Right. And so the smoke from the altar of incense, the incense is taken, put into sensors, carried around to purify, as we've talked about on the show before. Right.

We repeat it that we are offering ourselves to God and our whole lives and our whole selves and each other, our whole community, our whole family, we are offering to God. Right. So we participate in Christ's self offering. Eucharistically, we also participate in Christ's self offering by offering ourselves and our lives to God. Just as Christ offered himself and his life to God the Father, he doesn't do it in our place, so we don't have to. Right. We do it in and with Christ."}

You know, as we, as we finish up this episode, the thing that struck me the most, of course, is this sense that, you know, it's not, it's not substitution, it's participation. Right. Christ, who is the firstborn from the dead, the first, first, first in so many ways that we then follow him, so he's made a way and then we walk the way. Right. And so we, we live the life of Christ, meaning we do the things that he did and live the way that he lived. And then, and then this ultimate thing that St. Paul says here, that we present our bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which is your spiritual worship. And, and I think this of course is a very well known verse in the scriptures. And I think in a lot of ways it gets kind of evacuated of meaning because of the way that worship is understood here in modern America as meaning any kind of religious thing that you do or religious feeling thing that you do. I mean, I, I've said this before and I don't know in other places probably, but I don't remember if I've said it on this show or not. But I mean, I've heard, obviously, you know, singing songs is called worship, hearing sermons is called worship. But I've even heard, you know, getting together with a group of friends and having a beer at a restaurant called worship. Meaning that. What does that word mean in all those contexts? Well, it means we got together and felt religious, whatever that means. Exactly. And so, you know, when you say, then present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, then that means nothing if sacrifice doesn't have any positive content. You know, spiritual worship, it doesn't have any positive content, just means getting together and feeling religious or something like that. But I think, I mean, one of the problems that we have in the modern world is that a lot of times we've taken these words that do have a literal sense and then there's a metaphorical sense which is perfectly good, but we've forgotten the literal sense and we keep only the metaphorical sense. Right? I mean, we've talked about this a lot of times on this show. And this verse is talking about human beings being a sacrifice in a metaphorical sense, that this is a spiritual worship in a metaphorical sense. Now, metaphorical does not mean unreal, right? Because the literal sense of our bodies being a sacrifice would mean that we are being killed and put on altars and burnt before God. You know, like that is what a sacrifice is. You know, it's about foodstuffs being put on an altar and burned up to God. I mean, read Leviticus. So obviously that's not what St. Paul is advocating here. He's not talking about human sacrifice. And he clues us in. He says, a living sacrifice, right? So he's saying, hey, I'm using a metaphor here, you guys. So, so what does that, what can we take away from that metaphor then? Well, I mean, number one, everything we've just said for the last three hours, but also in terms of application, understanding all that we've just said, you know, connected to what, like one of the callers said, he says, well, there is this cosmic atonement that's occurred, but I have to live my life. And what does that mean for my life. So what exactly is a sacrifice? So understand the literal so that the metaphorical makes sense. Right? So, so a sacrifice in the literal sense is this food that is put in front of your God as a shared meal with your God, and it's unitive between you and your God. Right? It's this offering of hospitality to your God, and you are connected. And of course, part of what's going on in the Christian sacrifice, the Christian Eucharist, is that it's God who's actually the one offering the hospitality. He offers himself and shares himself. That's all going on there. He's the priest. He's also the one who's being sacrificed and so forth. So if we understand that that's what it is, is a shared meal with your God. So when he says offer your bodies with living sacrifice, and it has these same purposes, then that means that the way that we live should function as a unifying movement between not just us and God, but obviously, number one, between us and God, but also between each other. That the way that we live ought to bind the Christian community together. Right? Because that's what sacrifices do. Among other things, the way that we live should be a hospitality that invites people in and makes them part of our community. Right? And the reason why we can do this and it's effective is because Christ has done it and he's doing it in us. This is why we say Christ is in our midst. He's not just in our midst so that we have this presence. He's in our midst to enliven us, to live his life in this world, to be in the world, but not of the world. And the point is, you know, as Christ did not come to condemn the world, but to save it, we are here living the life of Christ, not to condemn the world, but to save it. Right? And so this language of living sacrifice is actually much more potent when we understand what the sacrifice of Christ is, and this is everything we've just been talking about in this episode, and we understand more broadly what sacrifices are, what the general category of sacrifice is, which we have spoken about many, many, many times throughout this whole podcast for almost five years now, bringing all of that together, then that should invigorate us, number one, so we have a clear vision of what this Christian life is. And then having that vision, then to live it in such a way that that passes on that vision to other people, but. But most especially invites them in so that our act of love is joined to what Christ did and is doing. And continues to do in us, through us, you know, in his saints, through his saints. And that's the way that this cleanses the whole world is, is that he's just as he sent out the apostles, as he was about to ascend into heaven, he has also sent us out. Now, we may not all be preachers, we may not all be called to baptize, right? But we are all called to participate in that Great commission. And the way that all of us are called to participate in that great Commission is to love one another. Christ said, by this will, all men know that you are my disciples, that you have love for one another. This is. This is a powerful, powerful thing. And I think especially here in. In 2025, where we know that people feel more and more isolated, people feel more and more alone, and people. There is a real meaning crisis that has occurred, people looking for meaning. Well, meaning is not just something that. That lands like in your head. It's a life that you live. Like you can become convinced of a truth or, okay, but you got to live somewhere, right? And what is it that we have as the church? We have the life, we have the way, we have the truth, we have the life. Christ himself. And so as we look upon the cross, and I mean, and not just the things we've said in this episode, but, you know, we're. We're inches now from Holy Week when we're recording this episode. As we look upon the cross, as we look upon the suffering of Christ. I mean, this is part of why we timed this episode for right now, because we're about to enter into that suffering and a ritual liturgical way, you know, let it transform you to the extent that you're able at this point in your life. Let it transform you so that, you know, when we sing that line, glory to thy long suffering, O Christ, that we are there and joining our suffering to his suffering, joining our love to his love, joining our sacrifice to his sacrifice for the life of the world and for its salvation. Father."}

We kind of get asked, you know, well, you've kind of torn apart penal substitutionary atonement and this other kind of atonement views. What's a more positive view then of Christ's Cross and what it does? Hopefully, we've kind of provided that in tonight's episode. So what I want to talk about now is sort of the. Therefore, brethren proceeding forth from that. And to do that, I kind of want to talk about another passage that talks about the Cross that we haven't mentioned yet tonight, where Christ says, if anyone would follow me, he must take up his cross and follow me. For what does it profit a man to gain the whole world and lose his soul? Or what would a man give in return for his soul? I think this is a text that gets misunderstood a lot. Maybe it gets interpreted in some odd ways. But I think we need to see it in light of a passage we did talk about this evening in Hebrews that talked about the devil being the one who wields the power of death and that our slavery, our slavery to sin is a product of the fear of death. Because the reality is every one of us who's born into this world."}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #114 - 2025-04-10 - Every Stick of Wood in the Old Testament","start":10714.56,"end":10949.26,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Going to, at some point, if we live for very long, at least going to face suffering and eventually is going to face death. We're going to face struggles, we're going to face difficulties, we're going to face hardships, both from our own sin and from the sin that's out in the world. And we can't avoid it. It's not like we could just opt not to do it, right? Sometimes people talk about taking up the cross as if, right? The other option is, oh, well, I just won't suffer. I'll just have a happy, nice life. That's not reality. The reality is the actual alternative that pretty much all of us, I think, and especially me, fall into is the fear of that. The fear of suffering, hardship and struggle and death, and therefore the avoidance of it at all costs. And we find different ways to avoid it. Some of us think, well, if I could just get enough money, then I'll be safe. I could protect myself. I won't have to suffer. Maybe I could even keep myself alive forever. I won't have to think about it. I won't have to worry about it. I can pad everything. Or we think, if I could just get enough control of my life, or we think, well, I can't get enough money or I can't get enough control of my life to stop this stuff from happening. But I can forget about it. I can drink or drug myself into oblivion. I can immerse myself in entertainment to avoid at least thinking about it for hours and hours at a time. I can shut everything off and just avoid thinking about it until I'm absolutely confronted by it. And then I will escape from it and the thought of it as quickly as I possibly can. But that doesn't work. We don't actually game the whole world. Christ is asking that as a rhetorical question. Even if that was successful. Even if you got all the money in the world, you're a richest Croesus, right? Jeff Bezos was coming and asking him to borrow money from you, right? What does that do for your soul? What does that do to stop you from having to face death, from having to face trouble and struggle and difficulty and suffering? Nothing. And you can't be blitzed out of your mind all the time, not without dying. And then you've run right into the thing you were running away from. So what Christ is presenting to us is a different path. And that path begins when we take the suffering of this life. We take the fact that someday we're going to die and we shoulder it, we own up to it, we bear up under it, we accept it, and we go forward. Nonetheless, we remain faithful to God in what we do. Nonetheless, we engage in the struggles we suffer, the heartbreak we suffer, the pain and the difficulties of life because we're following Christ. We know the path that Christ took led him through unbelievable suffering. Not just talking about the cross."}

The ridicule by people, culminating, of course, in the kind of death we talked about at the very beginning of this show. The horrific, nightmarish, torturous death that he suffered voluntarily. But we know that that's not the end of his journey. That's not the end of the road. He walked the other side of that death and that pain and that suffering was glory, was consolation, was joy. That doesn't have an end that exists in the world to come. None of the things of this world can save your life. And when the time comes that you face death, because you have to, and there's no way around it, you can't exchange all that stuff you've accumulated to try and get your life back. But if we follow Christ through the difficulties and pains of this world, through the struggles and the hardships that are all very real, and we continue following him, we will follow him through to the other side and enter into the light and the joy of Pascha and the resurrection and of a life that has no end. So those are my final thoughts for tonight."}
