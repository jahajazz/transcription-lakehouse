And he will be the light of the nations and the hope of those whose hearts are troubled. All who dwell on the earth will fall down and worship him. And they will praise and bless and celebrate with song the lord of spirits. First Enoch, chapter 48, verses 4 through 5. The modern world doesn't acknowledge but is nevertheless haunted by spirits, angels, demons and saints. In our time, many yearn to break free of the prison of a flat secular materialism, to see and to know reality as it truly is. What is this spiritual reality like? How do we engage with it? Well, how do we permeate everyday life with spiritual presence? Orthodox Christian priests Father Andrew Stephen Damick and Father Stephen DeYoung host this live call in show focused on enchantment in creation, the union of the seen and unseen as made by God and experienced by mankind throughout history. Welcome to the Lord of Spirits."}

So Genesis 6 through 9 is not the only place where the story of the flood, the definite article, as it were, is told. And so we're going to start out tonight by talking about some of the other places, specifically the other places in Mesopotamia, the land between the rivers. Now, if you're watching a horrible Bible documentary, I was about to say on cable television, but for you kids, that's like streaming, except you can't control it."}

But the idea that it is quote, unquote, plagiarism is, of course, stupid. The idea that the Bible is an original work of fiction bears certain presuppositions behind it that we do not accept. So we're going to start with. Even though it's not the oldest one we have by a little bit, we're going to start with the. What's called the Sumerian Flood story. It's called the Sumerian flood story because it is on tablets that are written in the Sumerian language. And because it seems to be part of a larger story, we're just missing the part before and potentially the part after the flood story itself. And so we don't have a name. We don't know, or we don't know the name of whatever the larger work would have been. We just know this is a tablet with a flood story in Sumerian. Now, you could actually go see this tablet I have right here in the United States of America."}

So when we hear Sumerian, we probably first think of ancient Sumer, like the culture, as sort of the earliest, one of the earliest layers of written human culture, going back to at least 3,000 before that bc that's a particular civilization and culture. There is a Sumerian language that comes from that civilization. The Sumerian language is a language isolate, meaning it is not related to any other languages. It is not a Semitic language. It is not a Indo European language. It is its own thing. And Sumer is also the name of that region, which is basically southern Mesopotamia. So today in modern times, basically southern Iraq, a little bit of southern Iran, but that region was Sumer. And then the northern region of Mesopotamia was Akkad. And Akkad is where the Akkadian language comes from. And the Akkadian language is sort of the Ur Semitic language, not of the city of Ur."}

Cities in Akkad and cities in Sumer at various points in ancient history dominated each other. Like we talked about earlier, around 2000 BC in the UR3 period when we were talking about Abraham, that was the Sumerian Renaissance. And that was where Sumer and Ur in particular re rose to prominence and sort of dominated the northern area of Akkad. And so it went back and forth between northern and southern regions. But so even though this is a period of time where Akkad is more dominant and most of the things we have being written during that time are being written in Akkadian, this is written in Sumerian. That said, because of the time likely that it's written, the Sumerian that it's written in is sort of heavily influenced grammatically, especially in the verbs by Akkadian, by Babylonian, Acadian."}

One of those is that people highly suspect, and we'll see more about this as we go on tonight, that even though this is being written in Sumerian, that there is a Babylonian version of this story in view for the person who's writing it. He may not be directly translating from Akkadian to Sumerian. He could be, for example, making a copy of an earlier Sumerian translation. He could be just sort of putting this version of the story together himself. And just he personally knew both languages. And so his Sumerian was kind of accented by his Akkadian because Akkadian was his first language. That happens."}

And so basically what we get in this tablet, in this story is that there are two groups of gods. There's the great gods and the lesser gods. This is a constant through all these stories. But this is also a constant through ancient Near Eastern paganism, even into Greek and Roman paganism and even I think into Norse paganism. That there are sort of these two tiers, right? You've got, in Greek paganism, you've got sort of gods proper and then you've got sort of nymphs and spirits and things that are sort of lower ranked. So you have the same thing. You have greater and lesser gods. In ancient Near Eastern view, the greater gods are obviously like the most high God and then usually gods associated with elements of the cosmos. Right? Sun, moon, things like that. And then the lesser gods are usually gods who in general, this is a generalization, so there are exceptions, but generally gods associated with various human activities like craftsmen and things like that. Or maybe like associated with that kind of thing."}

So in the Sumerian flood story, the great gods decide they're going to destroy the world. And it begins kind of abruptly. This is why we're pretty sure there was some kind of story preceding it. Probably some kind of creation story, because the other versions of this story, including the one in Genesis, obviously the story of the flood is sort of preceded by a story of the creation of humanity. We're just sort of informed as the tablet starts that you know, by the setting and everything that this is after the establishment of cities, the establishment of kingship. Right. So there's already some human history that's happened that isn't narrated on this tablet. So we assume, okay, there was, there was a previous tablet or previous tablets telling those stories. But so they decided to destroy the world. And there it begins with this. There's kind of a conflict between the God, 9th Ur, who is the God of creation. This is another reason why we Think there was a creation story in a tablet before this, because the God who created people doesn't want to see them all get wiped out, but kind of gets overruled by everybody else. And so the main character, the sort of hero character of the Sumerian flood story is Ziusudra, sometimes referred to just by the abbreviated sudra in the text. And Ziusudra is Sumerian for he of long life, the long lived guy, essentially."}

And Ubar Tutu is on the Sumerian Kings list. He is listed as the last king of Shurapak before the flood. So the Sumerian flood story tablet is working with a guy who is otherwise known from Sumerian text. And the Sumerian Kings list is actually much older. So this is kind of a known thing. Also for the record, I know I've mentioned this before, but this is an example. I mentioned this before on the show when we were talking about the genealogy of Cain and the genealogy of Seth.

So Ziusudra, this priest king, rather than waiting around however many more thousand years it would have taken to assume his father's throne, gathers his wives and a bunch of animals onto a boat and together they survive the flood. What we have of the text, and there may have been more tablets, more texts that explained more. Does it sort of tell us how he knew a flood was coming?

But so that's all we've got. You know, we don't have the whole frame story and everything of the Sumerian flood story now probably, probably the most well known version of the flood story in the ancient near east, as far as we can tell. And the reason I'm saying as far as we can tell is important and this is important in a broad range of topics far beyond the flood story in terms of our knowledge of the ancient world.

We, we know from ancient catalogs that Plato not only wrote a bunch of dialogues that we don't have anymore, but he wrote treatises like Aristotle, and we don't have any of them. Likewise, Aristotle, according to these ancient lists, wrote dialogues in addition to his treatises. We don't have any of Aristotle's dialogues. And those are, I mean, Plato and Aristotle, that's like as famous as you get in terms of preserving ancient literature. Right. And we have a tiny fraction of that now. When we've talked about this before with like the church fathers, of course, we believe that the Holy Spirit is guiding the church. Okay. But when we're not talking about the church fathers, we're talking about like the speeches of Cicero. Right. I'm not denying that there's divine providence involved, but yes, in God's providence, we have the things God wants us to have. And we'll rediscover things if he wants us to rediscover them.

That's the kind of things you get in scholarship, like real scholarship. And in that journal article they'll, they'll like acknowledge that here are the other possibilities if my thesis isn't correct. But that's not what you get from a lot of people. You get people making just very confident assertions. So we think Atrahasis, the Atrahasis epic, is the most popular version. And we think that because we've got the text in multiple languages in multiple copies across a period of several centuries now, it may be there was some way more popular version and we just haven't found it.

It was translated into different languages. We've found copies of at least parts of it in several different geographical locations dating to those different centuries. And so generally that would suggest that this is a very popular. And given the paucity of finds, like we don't even know what the full text of the Sumerian flood myth was. We believe based on that, that Atrahasis, this was sort of the main version of the story for most people of Babylonian and even later Assyrian culture. The Atrahasis epic proper was written in Akkadian. The primary tablets of the text that we have date to the 17th century BC. So that's the 1600s BC which again is the Babylonian empire, the original one. So it being an Akkadian, not surprising. We have the beginning of the text as part of this.

He is a big proponent of people learning to read cuneiform, which is an odd cause to soldier for, but it is his because he loves. He loves his literature. He loves making finds like this that he wants more people to carry on that work, because there are these racks and racks and racks of clay tablets, most of which are not super important, but a few of which may be very important, like this. And not enough people to go through and read them and find out what they are. But so we have a much more full picture just in the last decade and a half or so. Based on the work of Irving Finkel about this, we also have, as I mentioned, we have pieces of the Atrahasis epic. So this one is the one in the 17th century by Ipigaia is the Old Babylonian text. That's how it's referred to. There is also. We have an ugaritic tablet from Ugarit. We've talked about Ugarit before on the show. That's from a few centuries later that is translated into Ugaritic. We have a Middle Babylonian version from later in the Babylonian empire before its collapse.

Now, as we said, the Atrahasis epic is this big epic story with Atrahasis as the main character. Sort of like the Epic of Gilgamesh that we're going to talk about next. But it includes within it a flood story. And in the flood story, you may see some familiar themes to what we already saw in the Sumerian flood story. So once again, we have greater gods and lesser gods. But of course, we have the beginning of this story, which means we have the story of the creation of humanity that leads into the flood. So we have sort of a better scope here. And in it. So there's no humans, there's just the greater gods of the lesser gods. And so the greater gods make the lesser gods do all the work."}

Now, obviously that's not going to save everybody, but at least potentially can save Atrahasis and his family and a bunch of animals. It's worth noting also that Enlil, not just because of his behavior here, is kind of the devil."}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #124 - 2025-09-16 - Soon the Water Will Come","start":2568.3,"end":2627.7,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Yeah. So Enlil was the most high God at this point in the original Babylonian empire. Like The Bronze Age Babylonian Empire, he was no longer the most high God after the Bronze Age collapse. And of course, you have the ascendancy once the Neo Babylonian Empire starts, you have the ascendance of Marduk. So as we've talked about before on the show, when the fortunes of different cities and different empires and different political regimes, et cetera, on earth would rise and fall, they saw everything on Earth is like a mirror for everything that's going on in the heavens. So that meant corresponding things were going on with the gods. Yeah, Right. And of course, all of them had within their history, built in the idea that whoever was the most high God at that point wasn't always and might not be at some point in the future."}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #124 - 2025-09-16 - Soon the Water Will Come","start":2629.62,"end":2707.96,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Yeah, the succession myth that God had overthrown some other God to become the most high God and some other God could come along, overthrow him. This is what's going on in Isaiah. Since we're talking about Isaiah, when God says that he's Yahweh and before him there was no one, and after him there will be no other. That's pointing at the idea of no succession method. He is always and will always be capital G, God, God of gods, Most high God eternally. Right. So Enlil has this fall right within their understanding. And so when Isaiah decides to talk about the fall of the devil, the Hebrew there is, hello, Ben Shakar. Shakar is the name of the Morning Star, aka Venus. This is the name that St. Jerome translated into Latin as how art thou fallen Lucifer, son of the morning. Yeah, but the hell, there is a Hebrew version. There's good reason to believe. There's some good journal articles about this of Enlil."}

Yeah, you used to be something, now you're nothing. So Enlil is kind of literally the devil in Isaiah. And you could see why that connection would be made by his behavior here. He creates humanity as this slave race, and then when they get to be too many, decides to wipe them out. But does that remind you of anyone else you might have read about in the Hebrew Bible?"}

No, like the Babylonians themselves thought their God was kind of hateful and anti human flourishing. That's not a twist being put on their beliefs.

So that's sort of the setup for the flood. And then we get to the tablet that Irving Finkel found. The Finkel find, as it were, found as if by the fickle finger of fate, I'm sure. And that actually that tablet is incredibly interested in boat production. Pretty much the whole tablet is just about the details of the construction of this boat. And probably the most interesting thing about the way this boat is described in this tablet is that every other version of this, including the one in Genesis, the boat, the ark, is rectangular, broadly rectangular. It is longer than it is wide and square, whereas in this version the boat is round. So it is a kind of coracle boat that the Babylonians at the time used, albeit much larger, that was sort of like a big concave disk that would float on the water. And so in this tablet, Atrahasis needs raw materials to build his boat. So he tears down his house and repurposes the wood and stuff. And it goes into great detail about how he created ribs. The way you would reinforce the structure of the boat was there would be sort of wooden ribs that ran the diameter of the circle going down into the concave portion at even angles, like about every 10 degrees for 360 degrees. And so those would reinforce sort of the whole structure. And then there were those bands would hold it together. And so Atrahasis then gets his family and a bunch of animals on this giant circular disc. And so when the Flood happens. They're floating on this disk. You know, there's. There's debate about the significance of the disc. There are some people who take sort of the minimalist position, right, that basically just. He's talking. That's the kind of boats Babylonians used. So when he talks about building a boat, it's just a giant version of the boats they were familiar with, especially the level of detail."}

It's a disk. But that is a clear theme in Genesis. The idea of the ark is sort of a microcosm of the creation. And so they say maybe that's an element shared with this story and that's related to the circular boat as a way of conveying that. So then after the flood, right, the flood subsides, and Atrahasis and his family are made immortal after the flood. But even though they're made immortal, the gods decide, hey, we can't let this happen again with there being too many people. And so Enlil and the other gods afflict humanity with early death, infant mortality, barrenness, to reduce the number of people going into the future, which again, is."}

But yeah, so the, the, the Epic of Gilgamesh, like the Epic of Atrahasis, obviously, is not primarily about the flood. In fact, even less so in that Gilgamesh is not the guy who survives the flood. Right. It's not even the main character. The guy who went through the flood is a supporting character and part of the Epic of Gilgamesh. So it is an epic that contains a flood story. It is not itself a flood story per se. And honestly, what is there of the flood story is almost identical to the Sumerian flood story to the point that Utnapishtim, who is the flood survivor in the Epic of Gilgamesh in Akkadian, basically means the same thing as Ziusudra in Sumerian."}

And that is the primary role. We're told about how he survived the flood. The flood thing is narrated, sort of his backstory for who this guy is. His importance in the Epic of Gilgamesh isn't about him surviving the flood, really. That's sort of secondary. It's that as the flood survivor, he's immortal. Like Atrahasis was made immortal. And so he has the secret, the antediluvian secrets. Right. Including the secret of immortality and Gilgamesh after the death of Enkidu. The rest of the Epic of Gilgamesh is all about him trying to avoid death. And so he goes and he searches out Utnapishtim and, and Utnapishtim puts him through these trials to see if he's worthy of immortality. And the trials are essentially to see whether or not Gilgamesh is subject to human weaknesses. Remember, he's 2/3 God and one third human. He's a giant. So it's, you know, can you go without sleeping, can you go without eating or drinking for these long periods of time? And of course he fails those trials and he tries to grab the flower that holds the secret of immortality. Flowers which of course turn into fruit."}

So it really, the flood story part of really falls in with what we've already been talking about. So then finally, our last, sort of the last witness to ancient Near Eastern Mesopotamian paganism is a fellow by the name of Berossus. And I know we've brought him up a couple of times, at least in brief, on the show before Berossus is his actual name. Berossus is the Greek version of his name, which was actually Belarusu."}

And so what happened is by the time you get to the Greek period, he's right, he's living in the third century B.C. okay, so the 200s B.C. so he's living under the Greeks, he's living under the Seleucids. And so with the rise of the Greeks and everything, what has happened is in that they have survived at all and not been sort of absorbed into Greek religious traditions. The Mesopotamian traditions have all kind of assimilated to each other. So in the Neo Babylonian Empire, Marduk has the role of most high God. So we're talking about there Neo Babylonian empire, we're talking about like the 6th century BC. And then over time, as you get into the Persian period and this assimilation starts happening, Marduk gets assimilated with BAAL first. BAAL comes into Babylonian religion as Bell. So think about the story, the additional piece of Daniel that's found in the Greek version, Bel and the dragon, he's in Babylon and then gets assimilated to Marduk. So by the time you're in the Third century bc. Our friend Berossus is a priest at the temple of Bel Marduk. Like, they just hyphenate it, like, yeah, BAAL Marduk, basically the same guy. So they've taken this sort of Syrian Semitic pagan traditions and the Babylonian Mesopotamian pagan religious traditions. It just kind of put it all together insofar as it has survived it all into the Greek era. But. So that makes Berossus sort of the repository of all of this tradition. And he then writes in Greek and he writes about these traditions to Greeks in Greek as a way of both preserving these traditions and showing points of continuity and interest as it relates to Greek pagan religion. And the main text he wrote, which does not still exist, by the way, we don't actually have the. His text. We just have lengthy quotes from it and we have quotes from it from all kinds of people."}

Again, you always have to be a little careful because when we only know them from quotes, number one, we don't have any context for those quotes. So you're just kind of assuming that the person quoting them is doing it accurately to the context and doesn't have an agenda of their own. You want to assume that this is the biggest place where this is a problem when you're reading theological stuff, especially if you're reading early Patristics, is you will see people referring to Papias all the time. Well, Papias said xyz, Papias taught Papias in his work, thus, and so said, yeah, we don't have any of Papias's works. They didn't survive. We only have Papias in quotes. And some of those quotes are for people like Eusebius of Caesarea, who sometimes have somewhat suspect motives. You notice Eusebius of Caesarea is not Saint Eusebius of Caesarea."}

Right. That's of any age. And so he sort of compiles all of these Mesopotamian traditions as they had survived to that point in Greek. And that includes, we have quoted in two different places at some length by Greek pagan authors, his version of the flood story. And so his version, the hero is in Greek Zisuthros, or Zisuthros, which you could kind of see Ziusudra in there, which is the Sumerian name. And he is the son of Otirtes. Remember Ubar, Tutu? So those seem to have been preserved. He just kind of Hellenizes them because he's writing in Greek and you gotta Hellenize names. And in his retelling, Zisudra has this dream and it's Kronos who comes to warn him about the Flood. So Ea here, or Enki, has been, for at least for Berossus's purposes, to the audience he's talking to is seen as being equivalent with Kronos, which kind of fits because this would be an older tier of gods, not the current tier of gods with Marduk and stuff.

This version of the story, Berossus explains how that worked. Right, they buried it on tablets, right? And clay tablets would survive a flood, especially if you buried them underground. Some other details here, Berossus has, at the end of the flood, Zeuthros starts releasing birds to go look for dry land. These birds are unidentified as two species, but just birds. And when they finally don't come back, he says, oh, they found dry land also immediately when they disembark. And by the way, the, the boat in this one, again, like we said, only the atrahasis one is round. This one is also right, a big rectangle. But the boat, when it lands, the floodwaters subside. They immediately come out and offer sacrifices to the gods. And then Zutheros is told that as a reward for being so wise and so clever in surviving the flood, he gets to become a God."}

Berosses, after telling this story, which is we've seen scene, is very much in keeping.

{"episode_id":"LOS - #124 - 2025-09-16 - Soon the Water Will Come","start":4397.94,"end":4721.91,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Yeah, I haven't said that in a while, so. Yeah, I mean, you even left some of the sources out. That theory. People know of it as jedp. It's actually called the documentary hypothesis. Goes back to. Well, it goes way back, but the sort of classical form of it is in Klaus Wellhausen, German name you might note. And so you've got J, that's the Yahwist source. You've got E, which is the Elohist source, D, which is just the book of Deuteronomy, and P, which is the post exilic priestly source. And this went through phases, right? So it started out, it was just sort of a J and E thing because people noticed, hey, in some of these passages, particularly in Genesis, but also in the rest of the Torah, there's some places where God is called Yahweh, there's some places where he's called Elohim. And so originally, originally, if you go all the way back, the first guy to have this theory in the 18th century was actually trying to defend Mosaic authorship by identifying the sources that Moses used. So his idea was that Moses used pre existing sources and Moses is the one who brought them together. And what God was called was part of the basis for making that division. And then various theories, I could go on and on, but that's various theories about Deuteronomy being different. And you could. Textually, Deuteronomy is stylistically, it's stuff a little different than the other four books. So it's not based on nothing. It's a question of whether that basis is enough to support the theory that they then built. And then the whole idea of P, of there being this post exilic priestly source is based on the presupposition that Israelite religion had to evolve, that it had to start in one place, basically polytheistic, de rigueur paganism. And then it became some kind of vaguely monotheistic thing that resembled the religion of the Bible only after the exile. And so Anything that sounds like that kind of religion can't possibly have existed in the time of Moses or even before the exile. And therefore all of that stuff had to be added by priests who edited the text after the exile. And it is a beautiful piece of circular reasoning because it's. Well, all of this and that, right? Like the distinction between. We're talking about the flood story tonight. The distinction between clean and unclean animals. That doesn't make any sense in Genesis. That's before Leviticus. So that must have been added by the priests after the exile. And you say, well, how do you know it was added by priests after the exile? And the answer is, well, because that's stuff that priests would add after the exile that didn't exist before the exile. Well, how do you know it didn't exist before the exile? Because it only gets added by the priests after the exile. So it's just this kind of circular thing. And the whole distinction between J and E sort of assumes that one author couldn't refer to God by multiple names. And part of the. Part of the problem with that is there are actually other names used for God, like El Elyon and El Shaddai in the Torah. They don't hypothesize those as being separate sources for some reason, like they acknowledge. I mean, you look at any. Let's just talk about pagan religions, the ancient near east, they all had piles of different titles for their gods. Any given God has a pile of titles. Why couldn't ancient Israel have had the same thing? So there's just. There's not actually evidence to support it. You have to approach it with presuppositions. So it reached a point where it went crazy. You could pick up stuff from the early 20th century where you have people writing, again, with total confidence, total confidence, talking about this half of this verse comes from J2 because they'd have, like J1, 2, 3, and 4 as separate sources. Wow. And E1, 2, 3, 4, 5, P1 and 2. Right. They just write with total. This half of the. I mean, two words out of a verse would come from one source and the other two words would come from another source. And you're like, what? Right. And as you point out, right. So you point out some duplications. This is. This is another problem with this theory. So we're to assume that the final editor was both brilliant at bringing all of these texts together and a complete idiot because he didn't notice all the places where he left seams like that. Like, why would he leave a reduplication why wouldn't he have corrected that? If there was one guy who was putting this all together, the final editor. It sort of doesn't make sense. But that a lot of that theory, that sort of super elaborate form of that theory. They even did a. They did a critical edition of J at one point too."}

But that theory has largely fallen out of favor now, at least in the super elaborate form. The J and the E part is mostly out of favor still. Your average secular Old Testament scholar thinks. Thinks Deuteronomy is by a completely different author and from a late date. There are reasons that I won't go into. Right. There's a long argument why I don't think that's the case. A good part of that argument is in Meredith Klein's Treaty of the Great King."}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #124 - 2025-09-16 - Soon the Water Will Come","start":4756.68,"end":4893.58,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"But that's most people think and most people think that sort of the final layer of editing on the Torah as a whole. Right. And, and we've talked before on the show about there's definitely editing between what Moses wrote and what we now have in terms of updating the language, updating place names, all that kind of stuff. Most certainly the last stage of that editing was probably done by priests because they were the ones who were literate and who had possession of the texts sometime in the time of Ezra. There's good reason to believe that the different Second Temple traditions and stuff. So you know, everybody kind of believes that in various forms of it, you know, but mostly now people have a more. It's less based on like discrete words and parts of verses and sentences come from different texts that existed. And more of this is a body of texts that developed over time. And different scholars will chart that development in different ways. They'll have. It's more now that different parts of it are older or newer rather than like Deuteronomy, the whole thing being newer and that kind of thing, rather than chopping everything up into tiny pieces because you kind of get a big house of cards and then it all falls down with that approach. Yeah, there's. There's no. To me, the biggest thing though in terms of the second part of your question of whether orthodox people should pay any attention to it is it's not actually at all helpful. Right. I mean, if you're trying to publish a journal article arguing for the existence of J7. Okay. Gives you something to write a journal article about. But I mean in terms of what the text of Genesis means, what it's saying to you, how it's been interpreted and applied by the church over the centuries. All that theorizing and stuff is irrelevant. I mean, if you're a nerd and you want to get into it, go do a PhD in Old Testament. Cool. More power to you. But in terms of regular orthodox Christians, it's really kind of useless. And Wellhausen basically said that at the end of his life."}

In Matthew 24, Jesus says that at the time of his second coming, the world will be like the days of Noah marrying and giving in marriage. Could that be a reference to the Nephilim ritual returning in the end times? And connect with some ideas about the capital A Antichrist being a fully demonized human and speculating wildly. A lot of messianic sounding transhumanists and UFO cultists hope for a literal biological merger with either super AI or quote unquote aliens, which could lead to the very rituals that we're talking about happening in modern times."}

That doesn't like the Nephilim ritual wasn't what most of marriage in the days of Noah was about. That was, you know, certain God kings doing that kind of stuff, whatever. But I don't know, maybe I'm wrong, but my sense of that is that it's really about, like, people are just not even going to see it coming. You know, they're just going to be going about life as they normally would, making plans for the future, getting married, having kids, et cetera, et cetera. So I take it in a much more kind of humdrum, mundane way. I don't know. What do you think, Father? Is that a reference to that or."}

So yes, Plato talks about Atlantis in two of his dialogues, the Timaeus and the Critias. And if you don't know a lot about Plato, Plato's dialogues are named after the main interlocutor, the person who Socrates is talking to in the dialogue. Yeah. So the Timaeus is mainly. There are some other people, but the main people talking in it are Socrates and Timaeus and then the Critias. The main people talking are Socrates and Critias. And so this is our oldest source, like we mentioned. Everybody else who talks about it in the ancient world, including like church fathers and stuff who refer to Atlantis are all referring to Plato. Yeah, when they refer to it, that said, Plato claims he's getting it from somewhere else."}

Everybody else is citing Plato. So Plato's Timaeus is essentially Plato's version of the creation story, which I became intimately familiar with when I translated it in a Greek independent study I did in my undergrad. And you know, when I figured out that was a bad idea, I figured out that was a bad idea when I spent three days working on this chunk of it and then finally sort of gave up and went and found a translation. And in the translation it said this section is hopelessly corrupt. And I was like, cool, don't even. But the Tobaeus is sort of his creation story. That's where he talks about the demiurge, which is sort of like Aristotle's world soul. Although distinct in several ways, the demiurge crafts everything according to the interplay of chance and necessity, et cetera, et cetera."}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #124 - 2025-09-16 - Soon the Water Will Come","start":5479.05,"end":5556.59,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Interestingly, interestingly, in the Nag Hammadi library, the big find of ancient Gnostic texts, there was a copy of Plato's Timaeus in there with things like the Gospel of Mary Magdalene and all of these things. Gospel of wisdom. So it seems to have held on to been the Gnostic part of the Gnostic creation myth too, at least at some level. But so Atlantis has talked about there briefly in terms of the creation story. The main place where Plato talks about the Atlantis story and Atlantis as such is the Critias. And in the Critias it's really talking about the history of the world, especially the history of the world vis a vis politics. So while it's unclear in the Critias. So the Critias talks about where Atlantis was in relationship to the pillars of Hercules, which are the ancient name for what we call the Strait of Gibraltar, which is sort of the gateway from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic Ocean. The Atlantic Ocean, by the way, takes its name from Atlantis."}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #124 - 2025-09-16 - Soon the Water Will Come","start":5558.43,"end":5689.15,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"It's the ocean where Atlantis was. That's where it gets its name. And so based on that, you might conjecture that. Well, and this is true, pretty much every later interpreter understands Atlantis to have been outside the Mediterranean on the other side of the Straits of Gibraltar, but in the Critias itself. That's not totally clear whether it was a big island in the Mediterranean or whether it was on the other side. But everyone later on, it's the other side. And not only was there this big island, this gigantic island where the Atlantean civilization proper was, but they had gone out from there and conquered most of the Mediterranean basin. So they had conquered Europe basically over toward Greece, and they had conquered Northern Africa right up to the border of Egypt again, according to Critias. In the Critias. Now, supposedly Plato says of the Cretes, he is getting this information about Atlantis from Egyptian historical records, which he claims were translated by Solon. Solon famously took a trip from Athens to Egypt at the beginning of the sixth century. So we're talking about 590 BC. So Plato's in the fourth century. So we're about 250 years before Plato. Right? 200. 250 years before Plato. Plato says Solon was. He went there and he translated the Egyptian historical records. He found all this stuff about Atlantis and their records. Again, we have no other record of this Solon stuff about Atlantis. And this is kind of a stereotyped way. Whenever you read a Greek author, a classical Greek author who claims they have some esoteric knowledge of ancient things, they always claim they got it by way of Egypt."}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #124 - 2025-09-16 - Soon the Water Will Come","start":5691.62,"end":5738.75,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Yes, Egypt is all the old stuff. It was the oldest civilization they knew of. They kind of thought it was the first civilization on earth. They traced everything back there. So they're, they're the old civilization. They must know all this old stuff and whatever they do is the old way of doing it. Right. So his appeal to Solon visiting Egypt is kind of stereotypical. Right. But so what we are told is that when, and we've talked about this before, Plato talks about this in the Critias and other places. But in the Critias, this about Atlantis comes after the part that we've quoted several times on this show where Plato talks about during the age of Kronos, Kronos having Divvied up the sort of land and nations of the world among the gods."}

And Atlas, who was the eldest, was the first king of Atlantis and sort of the founder. Right. Of Atlantean civilization. Atlantis getting. It's getting its name from him. He's Atlas, and it was Atlantis. So he would sort of be the founder figure. So what this is setting up for the Greek pagan mind is that Poseidon would have been the God that they worshiped. And there would be a big temple to Poseidon in the Acropolis, the main city of Atlantis. And then there would be the grave of Atlas. Right. Attached to it as the shrine, as we've talked about before in the way Greek temples were set up, as the hero. Right. As the great man of old, the Nephilim, as it were."}

So Atlantis then is structured the way the island, like, structured, like the buildings and everything is in a series of concentric circles and that starts with a series of moats, like defensive moats around the island, and then works its way in inward up to, you know, the peak, the Acropolis, Right. Where the palace is and the temple of Poseidon and everything. Right. And so according to Plato and the critias, 9,000 years ago, from their perspective, so 90, 93 A.D. b.C. Right. Give or take. The Athenians, go figure, decided to stand up to these evil slaver Atlanteans and drive them back. And in the ensuing war, in the ensuing war, the Atlantean armies get wiped out by a flood and Atlantis sinks into the sea. But some of the members of the Atlantean royal family, who have some of that royal blood descended from Poseidon, didn't get killed in the Sinking.

And you may say, well, that's a really modern question. It's really not, because ancient people weighed in on it. And when I say ancient people weighed in on it, I mean, the first person to say that it was just an allegory and not actual history that Plato was talking about was Aristotle, like his immediate student. And you say, oh, well, Aristotle would have known, right? So it must just be an allegory. Right? But here's the thing. There's this other fella, Krantor, who was the student of another one of Plato's students. So sort of a philosophical grandson of Plato who said, no, it was absolutely real. And Plato, like, meant this to be history. So that disagreement goes back almost to Plato's Lifetime, as to what he meant, whether he thought it was real or not. My answer to this question is as one might expect for our anniversary episode. Pork no los dos."}

So the Mayans, the Aztecs and stuff, these are all descended from Atlantean civilization, just like all the folks in the Mediterranean Basin. That's why they all got pyramids and stuff. It's not just that, you know, stacking rocks in a pyramid shape, they tend to stand up longer than if you stack them in other ways. No, this is all connected to one root culture, the Atlantean culture. Atlantis proven by the existence of people in north and South America."}

But it was at a very early stage of that because he died in 1945. So we're talking about early 20th century. But here's the thing about Edgar Cayce. He was called the sleeping prophet because he would have psychic visions while he was asleep, like in dreams.

Disconnected from any historical reality. But Paul operated during his entire life as a faithful Pharisee within the Roman Jewish world. In St. Paul the Pharisee, Jewish apostle to all nations, Father Stephen DeYoung surveys Paul's life and writings, interpreting them within the holy tradition of the Orthodox Church. This survey is followed by de Young's interpretive translation of St. Paul's epistles, which deliberately avoids overly familiar terminology. By using words and ideas grounded in 1st century Judaism, DeYoung hopes to unsettle commonly held notions and help the reader reassess St. Paul in his historical context.

So my question is based on 17th century book by William Winston, and he postulates that Noah probably lived in China before and then subsequently after the flood and afterwards fathered the Chinese people through other sons born after the flood. As far as. That isn't necessarily the bulk of my question. But more relevantly, it seems like Noah has a lot of Lord behind him. A similar mythos really to Enoch in a lot of second temple Jewish literature and a lot in later Jewish, Christian and Islamic literature. You talk a lot about Enoch and Plato and Atlantis and stuff. So I was curious to know if any of these traditions had weight, I guess, in the faith because obviously we can pull things from the book of Enoch and say there's something to be gained here, but people don't really talk about, for example, Noah inventing healing medicines in the book of Jubilees or having messianic visions in the Genesis Apocrypha. So curious to know if, if there's something about Noah post Diluvian that, that we can take away from historic."}

I had never heard of William Whiston, but I see his book is called A New Theory of the Earth, which. So I'm gonna have to check this out. I mean, there is. There are all these kinds of interesting traditions about Noah having, obviously having antediluvian wisdom, because he literally is the. The main figure from before the flood within the Christian tradition. And even, like, if you read Jubilees, I don't remember if this is in. In first Enoch, Father, but I remember in. In Jubilees, the angels come to Noah and his sons and they teach them all of the medicine and stuff that. That all this knowledge that was lost before, you know, because of the flood, in a sense. Like, this is the redeemed version of all of that kind of stuff you get. You get in the pagan literature where, you know, demons are whispering in God King's ears. So, yeah, I don't know. I've. I've never heard of the China stuff, though. That's completely new to me. Have you heard of this before, Father Stephen?"}

There's a couple of things. So, like, some of those get referred to in the New Testament, Right. Like Noah being called the preacher of righteousness, right? Well, yeah, he's not doing that in Genesis. Right. But that comes out of, like, Jubilees and other traditions. So it kind of depends on what you mean by bare weight in the sense that this is a good segue into what we're going to be talking about here in the third half. If by bare weight you mean something, like, are historically accurate in the modern sense, then no. If by bare weight you mean do those traditions surrounding Noah contain spiritual truths, things that are applicable to the Christian life, things that are valuable, valuable ideas, concepts to be applied to the Christian life, then the answer is yes. But you've got to do a little work in each case to do that, because it's not always obvious, because most of those traditions come out of narrative sources, meaning it's not like a treatise where it just says, like, you know, Noah did XYZ go and do likewise? Like, it's just describing things happening, Noah doing things, things happening to Noah, things being revealed to Noah, Noah saying things. And there's some steps between reading that narrative and then interpreting it, and then what's the core here? And then how do you apply that? Right. There's sort of several steps you have to work through to get from those traditions to the sort of relevance, the weight. Right. That you're. That you're looking for."}

Yeah, so, but. So the point was, the reason we structured this episode the way we did is that. Okay, now with this background of other flood stories, of the Mesopotamian flood traditions that we talked about in the first half of Atlantis and the way that plays out. Right. That we talked about the second half, those ideas with those in mind, now let's look at the story in Genesis, which on pretty much any accounting, postdates the Mesopotamian flood stories, the quote, unquote. And no, I won't argue or discuss this, but the early date of the Exodus has it in the 15th century BC. The tablets we were talking about in the first half are from the 16th, 17th century B.C. so talking 100 years, at least, at least minimally, 100 years before Moses, those actual tablets were written, not that the story was come up with, but that those actual tablets that we physically have predate Moses, the oldest date for Moses. And then potentially that then if you date Moses later, there's even a bigger gap."}

That's a lot of things that happened, cultures that were formed, things that were written, stories that were told before the beginnings of the Bible. The Torah enters into the world. Right. You want to take the view, the Jewish view that the Torah is eternal. Great. It doesn't enter into our world. Right. Where people could read it and hear it until Moses. Right. At the absolute earliest. So any way you slice it, Genesis comes into a world that already exists and is already fully formed and is working within and against that backdrop.

And then when we get to Genesis 6, verses 1 through 4, and it talks about the Nephilim, it talks about the great men of old, the men of renown. And based on the stories we just read. Right.

What those Second Temple Jewish texts are doing is they're preserving that original context for us. That's what tradition does. Tradition preserves the original context in which a text was understood because times and places and things change, cities fall, languages change. And so the average person walking around the United States today who picks up the Gideon Bible in the drawer at their hotel and reads Genesis 6:1:4 isn't going to have any idea what it's talking about."}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #124 - 2025-09-16 - Soon the Water Will Come","start":8207.34,"end":8377.85,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"And there's not a copy of the Atrahasis Epic or Plato's Critias in the drawer rooms. Right. And the same thing was true in the third century B.C. that's why you write something like the Book of Enoch, to preserve that original context of interpretation after. Because again, in the third century bc, guess what? Jewish people didn't have a copy of the Atrahasis Epic, but the original hearers did. And so that context is preserved to preserve the correct interpretation over time. But our basis for understanding it that way, it very clearly means that if you're familiar with these other stories, there's no way you can think that the original readers heard that and thought about the sons of Seth. It's just not even plausible that that's what the original readers would have thought they would have understood. Oh, you're talking about these demigods, these heroes, these God kings, who the pagans worship and have shrines to next to the shrines of their pagan gods who are supposed to be their children. That's who you're talking about. And you're saying they're not heroes, they're not these great founding figures, they shouldn't be worshiped. In fact, they were evil, they were tyrants. They were thugs, and they were so evil and so destructive on the earth that God had to send a flood to wipe them out. So it's a complete inversion of the pagan story before the flood. It was not a golden age with advanced knowledge and technology. It was a corrupt and wicked age ruled over by tyrants. And this is why, if you actually start reading the story in Genesis 5, in the genealogy of Seth, when you get to the birth of Noah, the prophecy at Noah's birth is that God is going to save the world, save the creation through Noah. So what is he saving the creation from? God in Genesis is saving the creation from humanity. Humanity is created as the crown of creation, bridging the material and spiritual worlds. Right. In order that the whole created order might be saved through humanity. Christ becomes incarnate as a human, and then through humanity, the whole created order is saved. But what had happened before the flood is the inverse."}

The waters above come down, the waters below come up. The dry land is covered with water. So what Genesis describes is God uncreating the world. That's what Genesis has happened. Because what are you left with? You're left with where we started at the beginning of the book of Genesis. The waters. Yeah, including the waters covering the Earth. And instead of the Holy Spirit hovering over the waters, you have the ark, this microcosm of creation Right within the ark, floating on the waters. So Genesis does not describe a global flood. It does not describe a local flood. It describes God uncreating the world and then recreating it at the end. And that's why when the ark lands and people disembark, God gives Noah the same command he gave Adam and Eve. Fill the earth and subdue it."}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #124 - 2025-09-16 - Soon the Water Will Come","start":9101.65,"end":9216.03,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Because we get this stuff about eating blood here. And I know this is a misunderstood thing, right? Because we tend to get it opposite. We tend to read this in the exact opposite logical order from what's actually going on in the text. So the logical order we read this in is okay. God says it's okay to eat animals. Why? Well, not totally sure. I mean, I guess, you know, they haven't had time to plant crops yet, so maybe they needed the protein or something, I don't know. But for some reason, God finally gives them permission to eat animals and says it's okay, which makes it okay. And then he says, but don't eat the blood, though. Oh, okay. Don't eat the blood though. Right. And so people kind of puzzle over it. Right. That's because that's a reverse logical order. Here's the actual logical order of what's going on in Genesis, and this is drawn out in all the ancient commentaries on it. It's the exact opposite order. Okay, what was the problem that caused the flood? The problem that caused the flood was human sin. Specifically, human sin is it corrupted and twisted and destroyed creation. So we have to do something about that so that we don't get a situation like before the flood. Again, we need to manage that sin and the corruption of creation. How do we do that? We do that through atonement. That's what atonement is. It's the purification of the created order from human sin and its effects. How do we do that? Well, to do that, we need blood, Right? You do that with blood. Blood is life stuff. Gets rid of the death stuff. Okay, so we need animal blood. Well, how are we gonna gonna get animal blood?"}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #124 - 2025-09-16 - Soon the Water Will Come","start":9218.59,"end":9372.64,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"How do we get animal blood to do that with sort of pure animal blood? Well, you would get that from a sacrifice. Okay. That means we're gonna have to sacrifice animals to get the blood to do the atonement to stop the flood. Okay. So we've got to sacrifice animals. So if we're going to sacrifice animals, then people need to be able to eat the animals so they can participate in the sacrifices. So humans are allowed to eat animals in Genesis because they need to sacrifice animals and they need to sacrifice animals so they can get blood. And they need to get the blood so they can make atonement for sin, to keep the situation from before the flood from happening again. That's the logic of what's going on in Genesis about killing the animals, right? And so if you kill an animal and don't sacrifice it and offer some to God, or you kill an animal and sacrifice it, but eat the. But consume the blood, right? Out of those cases, you can't use the blood for atonement. And so you've taken that blood for no reason. You've taken the life of that animal for no reason. What justifies the taking the life of the animal is using the blood for atonement. That's the logic of Genesis. That's the logic of Genesis. Why then, you might ask, are we still not allowed to eat blood as Christians, which, if you've read Acts 15, you should know. Yeah, right. That's right. Because we're not using animal blood for atonement anymore, because Christ's blood kind of took care of the need for that, right? We still don't eat blood because that blood is still reserved for that purpose, even though we're not using it for that purpose. So since we're not using it for that purpose, we use it for no purpose. You drain it into the ground is what you're supposed to do with it, right? You return it to the earth for which the animals came, because you're not using it for atonement anymore, because you don't need to. But you don't eat it, right? You don't eat it. And so finally, finally, and this is kind of the core question that we were getting at a few minutes ago in this half, is the Genesis story of the Flood historical?"}

That's really putting a fine point on the question, right? Beyond even asking its extent, is it historical? We have to say a couple things about that. Okay. That. So first of all, the text of Genesis does not have a historical purpose. What do we mean by this? I mean, a text with a historical purpose would be like, if I went and did a bunch of research and I found out that something happened in my hometown 50 years ago that nobody knows about, okay? And I wrote a book about it, that book would have a historical purpose. My goal in writing the book is I want people to know about this thing that happened that they don't know that it happened."}

Don't scoff or mock, though. Those are bad in the Bible. Right? You need to point out, like you don't get it, man. That's not how this works. Okay? Like saints Matthew, Mark and Luke are not trying to convince you that Jesus rose from the dead by getting all of these details right and consistent. They're trying to communicate things to you about the resurrection of Jesus and what it means and why it is of preeminent importance. And the details that they use or leave out or put in. Right. Are all in service of the point they're trying to make about what they're describing. They're not just Trying to give some objective narrative accounting of. Here are the events that happened in order. Right? And I hate to tell you, but it's almost impossible to do that. I hate to David Hume at you, right, but there's a deep cut reference, but you can't see cause and effect. So as soon as you say X caused Y in a narrative, you've entered into the realm of interpretation and subjectivity. To be quote, unquote objective, it would have to be this happened, then this happened, and then this happened. But even that narrative, you're talking from a perspective, you haven't narrated every single thing that happened, just some of them. There's subjectivity. Again, you're saying something about it. You're not just communicating that it happened and that it happened in a particular way. So in the same way, if you got Matthew, Saints Matthew, Mark and Luke, you got them together in a room, they wouldn't sit there arguing about how many angels there were at the tomb and where they were positioned. They'd be sharing the emphases of the things that they wanted, thought were important, most important to say about the resurrection of Christ or about his death or about his teaching."}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #124 - 2025-09-16 - Soon the Water Will Come","start":9937.66,"end":10566.83,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"We've reached the end of our. Our episode on the flood, and I imagine probably a lot of you are thinking, well, what about, you know, all these other flood stories that exist, stuff in North America, stuff in other parts of the world and so forth. And I mean, we could do that endlessly. But I wanted to talk about one that I think, weirdly, maybe a lot of people don't know too much about. So I want to talk about the flood story as it is told in the Prose Edda by Snorri Sturlson, that Icelandic writer who is the scribe of much of what we know about Norse mythology. Snorri was a Christian and, you know, he lived probably 200 years after the baptism of the last Norse pagan. He never met a Norse pagan in his life. There weren't any Norse pagans around. So anyway, if you read the beginning of the the Prose Edda, you'll get the. The flood story as it exists in Norse mythology. So I'm going to just kind of retell it to you briefly in case you don't know it. There is a sort of primeval giant named Ymir and Odin and his two brothers, Vili and Vay, the sons of Bor. They decide to kill Ymir. And so when they kill Him. There's so much blood that flows out of his wounds that it drowns all of the race of the frost giants. So it kills giants. So you. You can see already there's a. A big continuity here between the biblical story and the other stories we talked about. You know, giant, a big flood killing lots of giants. And then the story goes on where that Odin and Vilian vey, they take the body of Emir, this, this primeval giant out into what is called Ginnigungap, which is kind of this big void. And they take parts of his body and the world is created from it. Right? So his body, basically his main part of his body, becomes the earth. His blood becomes the sea, the lakes, the flesh. And the rocks of his bones become the mountains and the hills and the. The land. You know, his teeth and become the stones and. And sort of this stuff. And then like his skull is used to make the sky. His brains are thrown up to make the clouds. It kind of goes on and on like this. And so there's this massive dismemberment of this giant that becomes the world. But there's an interesting detail in here that I skipped over on purpose because I wanted to cover it last. And that is there is a survivor. There is a survivor of the flood, right? And so here's what the text actually says. It says Boar's sons killed the giant Emir, and when he fell, so much blood flowed from his wounds that with it they drowned all the race of frost giants except that one, escaped with his household. Giants call him Bergelmir. He went up onto his ark with his wife and was preserved there. And from them are descended the families of frost giants, as it says here. And now it's quoting what's called the Poetic Edda, or a text related to it. Countless winters before the earth was created, then was Bergelmir born. And that is the first I remember when that wise giant was laid on a box. And there's more that goes on about the creation of the world from the body of Ymir, but I wanted to focus on Burgomir a second here. So Bergalmir is essentially the Noah figure in the Norse telling of the Flood. But you see, he's not. He's not a human. He's not one of the gods either. He's a giant. Now, what is relationship between giants and the gods? If you, if you go by what it's written in the Eddas, either the prose or the Poetic Edda, the. The line between the two is pretty fuzzy and there's a whole Lot of intermarriage between the giants and the gods, which is kind of what you'd expect if you know anything, for instance, about what we said about giants in our seventh episode now, almost five years ago, that there's this kind of intermingling going on. Although in this case there's no humans involved. And I think that's really notable is that the one who is saved in this flood is. Is not Noah, a human, a righteous human, but rather Burgle mere this giant. And then it says that from him is descended the families of frost giants. So all the frost giants get killed by this big bloody flood, except this one guy, who then repopulates the world with frost giants. And as far as I recall, Burglemir never shows up again in Norse smith. There might. I don't know, he might get mentioned in a saga somewhere or something like this. I'd have to go look. So he's actually a pretty bit character in all of this. But it's notable that he's the father of, you know, all the frost giants that exist post flood slash creation of the world. Because it's kind of the same thing in the Norse smith. Why point this out? Well, in Norse myth, the difference between the gods and the giants is kind of the gods are the good guys and the giants are the bad guys. That's sort of how it sort of shakes out in these stories and in the end of the world, Ragnarok, you know, which means, you know, the twilight of the gods, there'll be a big battle between the gods and the giants, and the monsters come out and they're, of course, on the side of the giants. And what's the difference between a monster and a giant? Eh, hard to tell. And the gods all get killed and many of the giants and monsters die as well, and the world kind of resets. This is a very different story than the one that's told in the scriptures. And I want to especially note that the one who's saved in the scriptures by God, this righteous man, is precisely a human being. Right? We've underlined a number of times in this episode the difference between the way that Yahweh, the God of Israel, comes across in the biblical flood story versus the way that the various gods of the nations come across in their own stories right now, like the Epic of Gilgamesh, the, you know, the. All of these stories that we've mentioned. This is not propaganda by Christians or Israelites about pagans. These are the pagans telling their own stories. Okay, so that they're telling you who their gods are, by the way that the gods behave in their stories that they themselves wrote. So, you know, we've seen this contrast. One of the things we haven't really underlined, though, is that Noah and I do hope that we do a Noah episode, but that Noah contrasts also significantly with the person, or in many cases, God, or God king or future immortal future God that is the one that's on the big boat in these various stories. And of course, we just mentioned in the Norse myth, it's a giant, it's quite literally a monstrous figure who is the one who kind of rides out the flood in his big boat along with his wife. Noah is not just saved by God. Noah becomes a new father of the human race. He becomes, in a sense, another Adam, right? And he is this preacher of righteousness. He's helping to reset humanity, to begin things well again, if possible. Now, we know, of course, that things go badly again after this, but Noah is this figure of salvation. He's the one through whom God is saving the human race. Ultimately, this points us to Jesus, who is not just a man who rises up as the righteous one in the midst of a very dark and faithless world and dark and faithless generation, right? But is also God. So Christ is the one to whom all of these stories are actually pointing, the one that's really doing it. Right? And even though he's not riding out a literal flood, there is nonetheless, the world is full of darkness and sin and is dominated by demons. That's the world into which Jesus is born. And he is the one who's. Who is regenerating the human race in and of himself. He is the true second and new Adam. Noah is a forerunner of Christ in that sense. And so I think that to understand the flood correctly is also to understand something about who Jesus is. And that's why it's absolutely the case that all of human history, not just Israelite history, all of human history, including the pagan histories, all find their fulfillment, their end, their purpose in Christ. And so, as we like to occasionally say in this podcast, you know, this isn't just about crazy, weird giant lore or flood lore or whatever, even though, of course, we enjoy the nerdy tour through, you know, clay tablets one can find stuck on a shelf in the British Museum or in the, you know, UPenn Museum in Philadelphia. It really is about Christ. And that's where we should arrive. And I think that this is one of the stories that shows us how the awesome arc of human history finds its Rest its purpose, its fulfillment in the Lord Jesus. Father Stephen."}

And far worse than that, belief in the New Testament and the Bible in general. Understanding that is actually being about faithfulness. That may not seem related to what we were talking about tonight at first, but it's deeply related because part of the watering down of faithfulness into just belief, just thinking something is true, mentally assenting to the truth of something has been the wrecking of our modern ability to read and understand the Scriptures. What's happened is that sort of affirming the historicity and particular details of the historicity of different things found in the Bible have become this whole series of shibboleths that mark out who is the real Christian and who is not. I was at a Protestant ordination exam once where this was the oral exam. They're trying to decide are we going to ordain this guy as a minister or not? They only asked him one question and that was do you believe that Jonah was really swallowed by a fish? That was it. And if he said yes, I mentally assent to the idea that in roughly the early 8th century BC a man named Jonah, who was a prophet of God was swallowed by a fish. Oh, you sir, are fit to be a minister to lead people to salvation. But if you say no, that you don't take that totally literally the way we'd like you to, then you are unfit to do that. We question whether you are a Christian at all. Let me tell you that is preposterous. And let me also. Right. This isn't just me bashing certain types of evangelical Protestant. Okay? This happens in the Orthodox Church too, maybe especially in America, but I don't know that for sure. Maybe more ubiquitous than that. Where certain things right back in the day. I'm glad this isn't the case. They were rather, do you believe, literal toll houses. That's what marked a real orthodox person from. Do you mentally assent to this idea."}

If you don't mentally assent to the idea that. See, in Orthodox circles, it's interesting because the Orthodox circles, it's, oh, the earth is 7,500 years old.

Even though 7,500 is not the number, you come up with the Bible, it's not what Protestant young earth creationists think. They think it's about a thousand years younger than that. If you don't assent to that, if you don't say, yes, this is true, then somehow you're not. You're not really Orthodox, you're not really a Christian. Here's the thing. That's not what believing something means. Because again, it's not belief, it's faithfulness. So it has to do with how you live your life. So if someone comes to me and tells me they believe in evolution, they believe in human evolution, okay? The question I have for them is essentially, what do you mean by that? Because if what they mean by that is, I learned about this in school, seems plausible to me, seems to be what reasonable people think, I mentally assent to the idea that, yeah, millions of years ago that happened. I don't care. It's irrelevant. Believe whatever you want, right? Believe there are witches in the woods, right? Believe that there's a pink unicorn in your backyard. It's irrelevant. It's relevant. Now, if what I say, what you say to me, when I say, what do you mean by you believe in evolution is I believe that this world, in this world is survival of the fittest. I believe that the strong survive, the strong should take from the weak. The weak should know their place."}

You're going to find quite the opposite. Now I'm concerned. Now I'm worried. That's a person who believes in evolution, and guess what? A person who says they think The Earth is 6,000 years old, but who acts like that, believes in evolution. You don't find out what someone believes by what they say. You find out what someone believes by what they do. What someone does, what they're faithful to the ideas that they use in their life and put into action that they play out. That's what they believe. And this is basic, right? If someone comes to me, right, and they tell me, you know, oh, hey, I've got this plan and that plan, and next year I'm going to do this, I already bought the plane tickets, I'm doing this and that.

And some of these things that I don't care about at all, like the date of the Exodus, it's because it makes no difference. It makes no difference in the Christian life of actual people, real people, which is all of you, all of you listening are actual people. You are not AIs. You are actual people who every day have to make decisions and have to struggle with things, struggle with temptations, struggle with desires that you need to not act upon, right? Struggle to do what is right, struggle to love people who aren't necessarily completely lovable to you all the time, struggle to work out your salvation. All of us, myself included, need a lot of help with that every day, moment to moment. And knowing who was Pharaoh during the Exodus does nothing to help with that and nothing to harm it either.

That's something I need to hear. That's something that's going to help me with those struggles. Understanding, right, that God right on point with what we talked about tonight, understanding that God didn't create me to be his slave, that God doesn't find me annoying, that God isn't irritated and angered by me and as likely to destroy me as to leave me alone, knowing that that's not God, but that God instead loves me, that he wants me to flourish, that he wants me to grow, that he wants me to have life. That's something I need to know. Not exactly when and exactly where and exactly what the extent of the flood was. That doesn't help me. That doesn't help me at all. Right? So that's what I'm getting at when I say there are some things that I just don't care about and that we're not going to discuss on this show. And you're not going to hear me discussing my Bible study very much. Right. There have been a few times where I taught some of this stuff in academic settings and I had to talk about those things a little bit because it was an academic setting. But for the most part, I don't care. It's not relevant to real people in their real lives. And even though I've got a PhD, and even though there's all kinds of stuff I love to talk about, I talk about even more wide range of stuff on my Twitch stream. I'll talk to you about comic books and movies and TV shows and video games and all kinds of stuff, right? But that's not. Those are the things I consider really important. At core, I am a priest. I'm a person who God has given the solemn responsibility of trying to help other people find salvation. And here's the thing with being a priest, right? Pretty much any other job where you're trying to lead people towards something, it's something you've already achieved for yourself, Right? Like if you signed up for an exercise course and you were paying money and I came out to be your instructor, you'd leave and demand a refund because you'd be like, this guy doesn't know what he's talking about. Exercise. What? Right. Fortunately, my parishioners don't have that reaction when I serve liturgy, right? Because I've tried to lead them towards salvation and I'm still working on mine. Some of them are ahead of me. That makes it really hard when you're a priest, when you've got people who are your spiritual children who are more pious and further along the road to God than you, more godly than you. Right? But, but that's, that's my job. And so while some of this other stuff is fun to talk about and cool and nerdy, like talking about, it's not what's important, it's not what's really important. And so for this show, for my Bible study and stuff, Right. Aside from some jokes, some asides, some presentation. Right. So I'm stuff to try to hook people in some rhetorical stuff, Right. Our real focus is on the stuff that's important and the stuff that counts. That's why we're not going to talk about the age of the earth. That's why we're not going to talk about the dating of the Exodus. That's that why. That's why we're not going to talk more than I already did today about jedp, right. Or any of that stuff. Or trying to reconcile the details of the gospel accounts because this is just not important. So focus on what's important. And when you focus on what's important, then the scriptures, the liturgy, the hymns, the writings of the fathers, that'll all open up to you because you'll be asking the right questions, you'll be trying to get the right things. You won't get distracted. That's what I got to say."}
