And he will be the light of the nations and the hope of those whose hearts are troubled. All who dwell on the earth will fall down and worship him. And they will praise and bless and celebrate with song the lord of spirits. First Enoch, chapter 48, verses 4 through 5. The modern world doesn't acknowledge, but is nevertheless haunted by spirits, angels, demons and saints. In our time, many yearn to break free of the prison of a flat secular materialism, to see and to know reality as it truly is. What is this spiritual reality like? How do we engage with it? Well, how do we permeate everyday life with spiritual presence? Orthodox Christian priests Father Andrew Stephen Damick and Father Stephen DeYoung host this live call in show focused on enchantment in creation, the union of the seen and unseen as made by God and experienced by mankind throughout history. Welcome to the Lord of Spirits."}

Giants Killers and Giant killers. But it's easy for me to say giant killers, Dragon slayers said giants killers. I think that becomes a football thing then. You are listening to Lord of Spirits podcast. My co Host, Father Steven DeYoung is with me from Lafayette, Louisiana and I'm Father Andrew Stephen Damick in Emmaus, Pennsylvania. We are recording live, but we're actually not going to be taking full phone calls tonight. That said, if you leave a question on our Facebook or ancient faith YouTube streams and we spot it, there is a chance that we could take it and respond. Anyway, let's dive in. So are you ready, Father Stephen?"}

This is going to be an all Q and A episode, everybody. So we got piles and piles of questions from you. Lots were sent by email, but then also a lot were sent by voicemail. And since we got plenty of the voicemail variety, we're favoring that. Number one, because we love to hear your wonderful voices. But number two, it just makes for better radio actually. But so don't be discouraged though we still want to hear from you by email. You're welcome to send that in, but like I said, voicemail is better. So here we are. Lots and lots of questions today. So I'm just going to start us off with the first one. This one comes from, actually my old seminary classmate Father Christopher."}

But one verse in this chapter stands out as very different. And on first reading, it doesn't look like it's dealing with sexual immorality. And that's verse 21. Furthermore, you shall not give your offspring to worship a ruler, nor shall you defile my holy name. I am the Lord. My question is, is this verse actually talking about the Nephilim ritual?

And I think there's good warrant for this. I mean, as an orthodox Christian, the iconography of St. John composing his gospel with a scribe always depicts him as an elderly man, for example.

I mean, it doesn't quite make sense in those Gospels, but if you, you know, if word has gotten out that he raised this guy four days dead out of the tomb, people are going to turn out for that.

Right. It has the foot washing that the other Gospels don't. Right. And then it has a much more elaborated sort of final discourse of Christ to his disciples right after. After the mystical supper. But it doesn't describe the institution of the Eucharist. Rather, you have John six, which isn't that whole discourse is not in the other Gospels. You have that talking about the Eucharist, but you don't have the actual institution. The weirdest one of these, though, is that technically Jesus doesn't get baptized in, in St. John's gospel because it describes him coming to St. John, the forerunner, and then it skips to when he came up out of the water."}

I have a question about prophecy. As I've been listening to Lord of Spirits, and my understanding of what prophecy is and the role that it plays in scripture and in our lives has been expanded. I'm a little confused about certain areas of scripture where it talks about the Holy Spirit coming upon someone and they begin to prophesy almost in an uncontrolled way. I mean, probably the most obvious example would be Saul, when the Holy Spirit comes on him when he's coming to attack David, and he begins prophesying and takes all of his clothes off. And it's almost like he's acting as if he has no control and is a madman, which seems to be something that we would associate with demonic possession, not the."}

It's not just like with Saul suddenly, you know, jerking around on the ground, you know, but, like, there are other cases where it seems like the Holy Spirit sort of takes hold of someone and kind of on some level, makes them do something. Right? I mean, what are the conditions? Why would he do that? I mean, obviously, we cannot know the mind of God, but you know what I'm saying, Like, there are clearly times when prophecy seems to be a much more kind of, you know, synergistic thing, you know, like, I heard the word of the Lord or I saw him and he said this to me, and now I'm passing this on to you. Like, it doesn't seem like, you know, there's no point where the Holy Spirit functions as a kind of, you know, functions through someone in a kind of oracular way that I can recall.

So we have to remember that the Holy Spirit, the way the Holy Spirit is talked about, and this is especially clear in the Old Testament, this is part of why we sometimes miss. It is as like the presence of God who's filling the tabernacle in the temple. Right. So it's presence of God himself. Because the Holy Spirit is God. Right. But as sort of filling. And that presence very much has this ambivalent nature, Right. In the sense that this is a blessing for Israel. Right. That God has come to dwell with them. It's also dangerous. Right. You have the whole death by holiness thing. Right. That is a potential there. Right. And so the way that that goes, whether it goes one way or the other in terms of the presence of God is based on, you know, the holiness or the corruption, the purity or impurity of the person encountering the presence of God in the Spirit. Right. And so a person who has repented, who's been made clean. Right. That's why. Right. Isaiah. Look at the calling of Isaiah. Right. Isaiah comes into the presence of God immediately like, woe is me. We'll say, right. The King James is like, woe is me. It is undone. Right. It's the equivalent of cursing."}

Right, right. So even prophecy is not necessarily. Right. Like a. A pleasurable experience. Right. And. And usually when you see somebody getting seized by the Holy Spirit, then the Holy Spirit departing like that, it's because that person themselves has not been sort of purified like God is doing his will through them. Right. But this Holy Spirit can't abide there because he has been purified. And so that's. As we come up, as we record this, we're coming up on Pentecost. So this. This chain that St. Luke makes between the purification of the world and of humanity. By Christ's blood on the cross, then allows the Holy Spirit to come and dwell within people. Right. Continually. Right. That that connection is there. Otherwise the Holy Spirit couldn't. Because it would kill us."}

I have a question about sin. What is it and how did it come into existence? In the past you've mentioned that sin is a spiritual being that seeks to dominate and master people like it did Cain. How did that spiritual being come into existence? Also, in a sense, is sin a form of mistimed goodness? My understanding of creation is that God made everything good. I've also heard Father Seraphim Rose quote multiple saints saying that in the Garden of Eden, God eventually intended Adam and Eve to partake of the fruit of the tree of the Knowledge of Good and evil. The problem was not eating of the fruit of the tree, but eating of the tree at the wrong time when God told them not to. As I've thought about this more, I've come to the conclusion that all sin on some level could be thought of as doing the right action at the wrong time. To commit adultery is to have sex."}

I mean, like this second part, we see this kind of language in some of the monastic fathers especially talk about passions as being. When they become sinful, it's because they're misdirected. Not so much like a change in time, maybe, but I mean, a misdirection in time is a misdirection too. Right. Like, you know, I could stand outside in my backyard and turn in circles and swing my arms around, but if one of my children comes within arm's reach, I should stop that. Right. Because I could hit them in the face, and I do not wish to hit them in the face. So I don't know. I mean, it's a good question. I mean, I feel like I have some sense of both. That sinfulness as a spirit, malevolent spiritual presence comes because of demonic rebellion. Right. That it's a force of actual. An actual personal force in the world that is fallen angelic nature.

You know, the thing I would say about this question of. Is sin just sort of goodness mistimed? I see where Travis is going with that, and I think that there's some truth to that.

They think about their motives, they think about the process of beginning it, and so on and so forth. But if it's. I'm just doing this at the wrong time, then that suggests that all that kind of led up to that action is the same. It's just. It's, oh, whoops, it's at the wrong moment, you know? But but the truth is, is that the. The kind of movement of sin is a different movement, right, Than. Than the movement of holiness. Even if the action itself, taken as a separate, isolated sort of datum, may not be evil, Right. It's not an evil thing to eat a steak. Right? But then the whole motivation that goes into putting that meat in front of an idol and praying to that God and having the desire and intention to share a meal with that God, that whole action is idolatry. It's not just the eating. Right? So it's not. It's not just kind of mistimed. It's an inappropriateness in a lot of ways. You know? So. So I. Like I said, I think it's.

And also sometimes in iconography, we see them getting kicked out of paradise and they have these fur garments of skins or clothes look like made from animals rather than the human flesh we have now.

I'm from Dallas, Texas. And my question is about the most recent blessing episode and how blessing relates to justice and wisdom. Because it seems to me that blessing and justice are practically synonymous since God founded creation on his wisdom, and his wisdom undergirds all of reality. If you're a wise man, then you live by that wisdom that God used by which God wishes us to live. Whereas justice is being set in proper order relative to creation, both in your interior man and in the external relations. So, you know, that's again, proper ordering."}

This is Father Vijay. I'm a priest in the Indian Orthodox Church serving in New Jersey. Thank you so much for your podcast. Very much. Love it. Prior to listening to your podcast, I would look at paganism and Hinduism as nothing to be concerned with. There's nothing behind it. And yet after listening to your podcast, then I realized that we should be concerned. We should be worried and we should be careful. Then going to your blessings and curses episode, it felt as if you were very dismissive of the curses and that there shouldn't be any concern. And so I wanted to clarify and actually a good soundbite to give to the orthodox Christian that is, you know, concerned with these curses. And we don't, in, in our jurisdiction, Indian jurisdiction, we don't have the, the, the, the, the evil eye. We have the black tongue and we have something called Ravagalam, which is like the hours of the day that if you start something new, it will be cursed. And so, you know, I think all of our communities have, all of our jurisdictions have this concept of our faithful are going towards this. But if you can just speak to it directly and say, how is the orthodox Christian to handle these, these curses? And, and in what way they should be careful or not."}

Like, it's not something that can, can take over. Right. Yet nonetheless, like if I, for instance, some of the, the, the book of needs, the priest, you know, prayer book, whatever, it gets translated as that you have. They have like a prayer against the evil eye. Right. So I mean, is it a thing or not a thing or is it something, Is it a thing that we don't need to be worried about? But even though it really is a thing or, you know, I was interested that at the beginning he said, you know, I used to think that this is, you know, we didn't have to worry about paganism.

And both of those traditions have radically different teaching on women and their role in the church. Now, I personally have a huge heart for the ministry. My great grandpa, who I'm named after, was a preacher. My dad is a pastor, and I remember I had a passion for the ministry from a young age. And I was sitting across my, at the time, beloved Baptist head pastor, and over a meal, he looked at me and said, if I were to pursue those goals, I would be a Jezebel. The Jezebel spirit, you know, is so huge in the Baptist church. And what I want to know is, what is the Orthodox perspective? Is there room for someone like me who is a passionate poet, thinker, writer, artist, and minister at the Orthodox table? Is there room for me there? And, yeah, I guess that's it.

You know, the thing that she's most remembered for, of course, in the history of the Church is as a hymnographer. And in fact, probably the greatest piece of Byzantine music in the whole tradition of Byzantine chant was written by her. And it's the famous Hymn of Cassini that's sung by on Holy Tuesday evening during Holy Week. It's so beloved that actually, in many cases, if you look at the Holy Week schedules for a lot of churches, it'll say, you know, Sunday night Bridegroom Orthros, Monday night Bridegroom Orthros, Tuesday night, Hymn of Cassiani. Even though it's Bridegroom Orthros, but including that hymn. But that's such a feature that becomes the thing that people are kind of going there for."}

But that's not the only thing she ever wrote. She wrote lots of hymns, actually, and they are. Even in translation. They are stunning pieces of work. Like, this is real theological poetry. You know, it's really delightful and profound and moving. I mean, there's a reason why the Hymn of Cassini is so, so popular. And it's not just because of the kinds of musical settings that are attached to it. Right. It's because of just the great, great depth of what's being expressed in that. And certainly there are other examples of that within the life of the Church, both historically and, of course, in our own time. And, you know, especially considering this old saying of the one who praise truly is the true theologian. You know, we tend to think of theologians as people who write books, you know, people like you, Father Stephen, or like me, God help me. But I wouldn't describe myself as a theologian, you know, that that's what a theologian is, or a professor or something like that. But, you know, there's a great truth to this saying that theology is really about prayer and if that's really true, that the person who is really advanced in prayer is the sort of the real theologian on some level, then the number one example of that is the Lord's mother. You know, the highest of all the saints is a woman. That the ministry that she gave, not just to us, although that's really important, but to the Lord is above all other possible ministries. You know, like you can't achieve something greater as a human being than what she did. Right. And that's not a cop out response. You know, I recall, I can't remember which episode it was, but we were having a conversation about, I think it was in response to a caller who called in and had a similar question about this. If you remember, Father, you know that, and you gave a great answer about mothering and how motherhood is not. Is of course the number one way people think about it and should think about it is about bearing children and taking care of them. But that there's mothering that all women engage in whether they have children in the flesh or not. Right. That, that's, that's the, the what, what women are in their, their telos is, is motherhood. And this is, this is built into the creation from the beginning. And I think our modern world tends to denigrate that so much that it's like, well, that's second prize or whatever, you know, but it's really not. And I think that the Christian tradition, especially in the person of the Mother of God, emphasizes how much it's really not. Because again, this is the highest possible place that a human being can have, is the one that she has more honorable than the cherubim, you know, and so forth. But I mean, I would simply say, Kenzie, that, I mean, it's true, right? You didn't ask about this, but it's true that the Orthodox Church does not ordain women as priests, you know, as clergy. And for, I think for a good take on that, Father Stephen wrote a great blog article on his blog, the whole Council of God blog, called Priesthood and Masculinity. And it's a really good piece and it talks about how priesthood is integral to masculinity, not just for ordained men, but just for men in general. Right. So it's true, yes, we don't ordain women as clergy, but I think that a huge part of the problem that we have is that we've identified clergy with power and we've identified power as the highest thing that people should have. And so therefore, if you don't give it to Some people, then it's because you're trying to keep them down. Now, you didn't say that, Kenzie, and I appreciate that, but I thought I would just kind of put that out there. But I would say that, you know, based on the things that you say that you love and the. The talents and skills that you have that, I mean, all of that can be put in service to Christ. There absolutely is a place for you at the table of the Lord and the Orthodox Church. I mean, every person is integral to the body of Christ. It doesn't matter whether they're a hand or a foot or a spleen or whatever. We're all needed and we're all required, really. So that's some of the thoughts that I would have about that. I guess the other thing I would add is simply, is that I could not live as an Orthodox Christian without the ministry that women within the church do. Not just sort of in support of the parish, whatever, but in my own personal life as well. So, I mean, absolutely critical, absolutely. You know, irreplaceable. Right. So, Father Steven, I don't know, did you have anything you wanted to add to that or whatever?"}

So in the atonement episode, you guys said that to atone just meant to cover. And so that got me wondering, not only how did. How did something so simple get so theologically complicated, but more so there. There are lots of places in the Bible where things are covered like Noah's covered up in his nakedness. You know, stuff is covered up all over the place. But are. Are those also atonement? Are they like a different kind of covering? What's. What makes this kind of covering get its own special word and those not? Or maybe they do. Thanks. Love the show."}

So that was actually one of my favorite episodes, was the atonement episode. It's been a while since we did that now. I feel like it was over a year, maybe. Yeah. You know, we talked about the day of atonement and how that is fulfilled in Christ ultimately. And I think that the short answer to what Lena is asking is that, you know, this word covering, right. Is just a general word, just like it is in English. Right. But if you talk about covering in a particular context, then it takes on a greater meaning. Right. But of course, the word. The English word atonement was actually coined to be a translation for this. This word. Right. And so becomes a translation that has a specific theological purpose. Within the English language. But if you're just simply reading it in Ancient Greek, then, or in Hebrew, then it's just a general term term. But you see, it's used in this one, one particular context. And I think the reason that it gets so complex in the way that Christians of various stripes talk about it is that it's such a key moment in salvation history. Right. That of course there's going to be just a huge amount of reflection on that. And when you have big sea changes like the Reformation's ideas about what salvation means, then you are going to, you know, it. There's going to become debate about it. Right. And of course. And so then that, that complicates the, the whole matter. Right. But I, it doesn't mean that the, the more general uses of the term no longer apply or that every time you see the word, you know, that, that Kfr isn't a Kfr root. Is that what it is?"}

So really, honestly, the reason why you get. And you don't. You don't have a similar history of theorization about the atonement in the East. You just don't. Right. You don't have people proposing atonement theories. You don't have people arguing them against each other. It just doesn't happen to these. Now, some particularly Protestant apologists like to argue that's just because we never figured atonement out. We're just like a bunch of primitives. Like, we did figure out atonement we didn't figure out soteriology, right? But that's because they basically bought into our 19th century German friends that all of these things have evolved in the church, right? And so we're just stuck. Get this earlier phase. Whereas, you know, German Protestantism in the 19th century is the pinnacle of all human religion, right? So, but, but in the, in the west, it really gets so complicated because you have a series of, as, as theology is being worked out, you have a series of questions, get that get asked. Each one is sort of engendered by the ways, the expressions of previous tiers of theology, right? So for example, with, I mean, this is a very rough and very quick genealogy. But for example, St. Augustine ends up kind of smushing together the coming of death upon humanity and sin and guilt, right? He kind of, he kind of webs those together, right? And so as the west being unable to read Greek post St. Augustine are reading mainly St. Augustine, that gets carried on. Well, that starts raising questions, right? Because in the east, for example, where we have a separation between death and sin, right? It's these two different things. We could say that, for example, Christ's resurrection redeems everyone from death, but it does not redeem everyone from sin, right? Those are dealt with separately. Whereas in the west, where if, if those start to get smudged together, you get, well, wait a minute, so then why doesn't Christ's sacrifice redeem everyone from sin? And so you get Peter Lombard comes along and makes this sufficiency, efficiency distinction, right? Where he says, well, Christ's sacrifice is sufficient to save everyone, but it is only efficient, it only actually saves the people who do xyz. Right? And that basic distinction ends up being the basis for basically the Protestant Reformation."}

So, so if you say, well, it's sufficient, but it's only efficient for these people, like what's the sort of mode or means of transfer? And so you get the idea of merit. You get the idea. And then that gets broken down further so it all becomes more elaborate because people are asking questions, but the questions they're asking were really engendered by the solutions to the previous problem."}

So, you know, my response to the second part is that my understanding of both sanctity and demonization is that the difference between, like, what a saint is and what, you know, the very good man in my parish or even the pretty good man in my, you know, or woman who's in my parish, whichever, is really not so much a difference of kind as of degree, that there's not. Like. I wouldn't necessarily say that there's a unique outpouring of grace that turns someone into a saint, whereas they weren't before. Right now, Certainly there are some people who are canonized, which is to say that there was a process that the church went through to recognize someone as a saint and to publicly venerate them in an organized way, but that's not what makes someone a saint. There are plenty of people who truly are holy people, actually saints that don't have any church services written for them. And maybe we don't even know their names or that they ever existed, you know, for whatever reason. So I don't think that there's like a line that you can cross and like, oh, now I've made it, now I'm a saint. Right. So I mean, my response to this question, is there a thing that you can do to truly to become a saint or some sin you should really avoid to become a demoniac? I mean, it's really just a matter of that faithfulness to Christ. It's not like, oh well, if I engage in this one kind of faithfulness, then that's kind of the shortcut to sanctity. I don't think there's any shortcuts to that. There are some. I wouldn't say it's like it's magic to become deeply sinful, but certainly there are some extreme sins you can engage in that do radically disrupt figure the human person. Right. You know, not all sins, all sins are bad, but some sins are worse. You know, like having suddenly an envious thought and accepting and entertaining it for a few minutes is definitely not as bad as going and murdering someone. Right. These are not the same degree of evil. Both, you know, both are, both are demonizing, both are, can push someone further in direction of evil, but they're not the same thing. So. So yeah, I mean, there might be shortcuts to hell on some level, but it's not like if you do this one thing versus this, then that'll definitely take. I mean, someone could become a very dark person, but have never done anything like illegal or some extreme act, you know, So I don't know that that's my take on, on, on that part of it. Yeah. I don't know. And the first part, I don't know. I mean, you know, whether you can. Yes, I do believe that the things that we do can affect other people, but I wouldn't say that they do it apart from their, especially if it's someone who's a baptized Christian, apart from their, their participation in it. Right. But I don't know, you know, especially when you're talking about the world of outside of Christ, then that's probably a different ballgame. I don't know. Father, Father, what do you had to say all that?"}

Anyway, that's digging in the crates. So. Yeah. So the thing is on probably intended that we have kind of a sensory processing disorder. And what I mean by that is. So the original meaning of the term common sense was a way to refer to the way in which our. Our senses, our five senses are naturally integrated to each other. Right. When. When we're. When as a human we're functioning normally. Right. We don't have like vision and hearing and taste and smell and touch as like disassociated stimuli. Right. But from them we have a quote, unquote, common sense that sort of constructs a world out of all that data taken in by those various senses. So we associate a smell with something that we see, right. Or taste or feel than a sound with something we see. But when it comes to the noose, which as we said, is a sensory organ that's aimed at the spiritual world, probably because it was blind for a good chunk of our lives. Right. And we're as Christians, just beginning to use it again. Right. At least I am the Saints, much better. But we don't really have it integrated with the other five. Right. So we have the five that we're used to using to engage with material reality. And then maybe we're starting to get the beginnings of some kind of very shadowy and dim spiritual perception, right? But not only is it shadowy and dim because we haven't exercised it much, but it's not integrated with the rest, right? So when you. When you read stories from the lives of the saints and even stories, I mean, we referred to Elisha and Gehazi a bunch, right? Because it's a obvious idea, right? You have saints for whom these. These things are integrated, right? And they will just see angels and demons and spiritual realities, right? And. And principalities and stuff. And. And that's integrated with the material world. It's not that sort of. They block out the material world and go into some spiritual realm, right? Where they see these things, right? And then they return to the material world where the rest of us live. It's that they're seeing the whole of reality and they're seeing elements of that that we can't see. So it's like if we lacked one of the five senses, right? So if we were like, you know, the man born blind whose gospel we read not that long ago as we record this, you know, we would have no concept of what color is. We would have no concept of. Of, you know, what vision is or how it works, right? We'd have our other four senses, right? And we'd understand how those work and they would be integrated and everything, right? But we wouldn't have. We wouldn't have that one. And so in the same way, it's sort of. And I obviously am not a saying, this is obvious to anyone who's met me or heard me talk or knows who I am. But, you know, so I can't. It's not like I have this. And I'm now trying to explain it to you who lack it. It's. I don't have it either, right? I'm reading accounts from people who do."}

To describe it to people who don't have it. And then I'm trying to pass that on secondhand to other people who, like me, really have it. So the key thing in terms of how they're related is simply that they're related in the same way that. To further this analogy, the same way that smell and taste are related, the same way that hearing and sight are related, right? These are just elements of the created order that we can or can't experience, right? All those colors a mantis shrimp can see, right? The way those are related to the colors I can see. Right. So it's part of creation in the same sense. This is the really hard part to get over. Right. Is that we could say, yes, they're part of creation too, but we still have. Well, but kind of in a different sense. Right. Because it's higher or different or. Right. But no, it's in the same sense. An angel is a creature in the same sense that I am a creature.

I mean, all kinds of horrible things were done to him. Right. Disfiguring stuff. And. And then. And then just simply says, you know, like the next morning or something, he was found whole. And because of this, many people believed in Christ. Right. And so they're mentioning the authorities, behead him. And it struck me once again, like. Like, well, what is it? What would that. What was that like when that wholeness happened? What. What was it like when people saw that that's what had occurred? I'm pretty sure there probably weren't like some explosions and sparkles and, you know, like, there was nothing. There was nothing woo woo about it. It was just simply like, whoa, he's. Hey, what do you know? He's healthy in every way. You know, that there was not, like, we expect, quote unquote, spiritual things to have some kind of special effect attached to them. Right. And yet you never like it when. When miracles, for instance, happen in the scriptures, you know, like, you know, the healing of the blind man. It doesn't say that.

Was it necessary to say, eat my flesh and drink my blood? This would especially have been a setup for the chosen people, the Jews, his own flesh and blood. Because he had established strict laws against consuming blood and against. Against consuming unclean flesh. Psalm 105. They sacrificed their daughters, their sons and daughters, into demons. They poured out innocent blood. Certainly drinking blood would have been associated with pagan sacrifices and gross things and demonic things. So was all this demonic sacrifice in the collective memory of the Jews? And was the Eucharist meant to heal all that the Jews were forbidden to drink blood, whether sacrificial victims or any other. So why does Jesus introduce this practice which is so likely to scandalize and much more akin to pagan practices than to Jewish ones?"}

Eating is the way you participate in a sacrifice. Right. That's. That's the way you take part in it. Right. And then sort of the human part I'll deal with here under the blood part. Right. So I mean, that's. That's the first immediate thing. So the idea is that Christ sacrifice is the sacrifice to end all sacrifices, and therefore we participate in it. Right. Then we do that through the Eucharist. So in terms of the blood, so the commandments against blood, if you go back to where they're first stated and where blood is first talked about, blood is representing the life of a creature. We have to remember that before the flood, there's also man was not permitted to eat meat in general at all. The killing of animals. And so what you have with the consumption of blood, because it wasn't. They weren't just prohibited from drinking sacrificial blood. They weren't allowed to eat meat with the blood in it. Right, Right. Completely outside of sacrifices. Right. So the blood had to be drained or drinking blood in any context. So the blood being the life of the thing. Right. Then directly consuming the life, life, feeding on life. Right. Was sort of symbolic of man as predator. Right. We talked about this when we talked about werewolves."}

Sort of cooperatively. But so predatory nature is then sort of the. The opposite of that. Right. And so what we see with Christ then giving his flesh and blood to us is an inversion. This is the exact opposite of predatory. Right. Christ does not say, you know, to murder him and eat him. Right, Right, right. To murder him and cannibalize him. Right. But he offers himself. This is why St. John's gospel is so clear over and over and over again that no one takes his life from him, but he lays it down. Right. And he can take it up again.

Good for you. I, I mean, I think the main, the main way to answer this question is, you know, sit down and read the, read the wedding service like it tells you. I mean, I'm not trying to say that to be glib, but cop out. Good night, everybody. But I, you know, it's, it's, it does say it, you know. Right. It's about yoking people together for the sake of their salvation, to bring glory to God, to bring forth children into the world, to be raised in faithfulness to Christ. Right. And there's even some cool theosis language having to do with the saints, like, you know, that the couple will shine like the stars of heaven. I love that line, you know. And of course, as a lot of people point out, there's this theme of martyrdom there as well. But I mean, as with all the sacraments that kind of take you from one mode of life to another, right? So baptism does that, Right. Ordination certainly does that. And I know a lot of people wouldn't consider tonsure to monasticism as a sacrament, although I think that some of the fathers do call it that. A holy mystery. I mean, we're not bound to the number seven, I don't think."}

I mean, it's okay if you need a number, it's fine. You know, all of these things that take you from one mode and of course, marriage, you know that one mode of life to another mode of life is to equip you to be faithful in this new way. Right. Because being married is a different kind of faithfulness than the life of without a husband or a wife beforehand. I mean, certainly the overall mode of faithfulness is the same, or the overall trajectory, I should say is the same. But the mode has shifted a bit. Now it's about serving Christ by serving your husband or your wife, and then, God willing, eventually serving those children. That becomes the first place where you're supposed to love Christ is with those people that are in your house. So, I mean, that's what I would say that the sacrament of marriage does, that the actual wedding service does. Although it's an interesting question I had someone ask. I can't remember what the context was. Someone asked me this recently. They say, is the sacrament of marriage the service or is it, you know, the whole life together? And, you know, I loved to kind of response with yes. I mean, there's definitely something."}

Yeah, Right. So if you're baptized and then never darken the doorstep of a church again. Right. And go out and live a life of sin and wickedness. It's not that the baptism didn't do anything. I mean, the baptism will maybe stand up against you at the judgment, but like it, it's not doing you any good. Right. Same thing with ordination.

This is Carlene calling from California. I'm a recently illumined new member of the Orthodox Church. I came in with my family in March, so I'm pretty green, so bear with me and give me lots of grace. As I asked my question, I wanted to know something about the traditions of the Church. One of the things I love, love about Orthodoxy is that it is the bastion of the ancient faith and that the Church is rife with tradition. And change, if it comes, comes very slowly. This gives me a great sense of security, and I love the wisdom and weighted care with which the Church approaches any shifts. So can you talk to me a little bit about how do changes in the Church occur? How does something like St. John Chrysostom, some homily for Pascha, become part of what the Church always does? How does St. Cassiani's hymns move into something the Church uses? How do shifts like this occur? And maybe you can give me kind of a zoom out view on. I realize the Church does make tiny changes and shifts, so how do those happen and still respect tradition and make sure that these are wise and careful changes? Thank you so much."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #046 - 2022-06-23 - Pantheon and Pandemonium IV - Asynchronous Q&A June 2022","start":7092.78,"end":7403.8,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Well, I love that question, and it's a good one because you have this idea that some people have that the Orthodox Church never changes. But of course, that's just historically untenable. Right. If they mean by that we do things exactly the same way that we have always done them in every possible respect. That's just not a thing. But what's interesting is that there is also, and she didn't mention this, but there's also this problem where people might acknowledge historical change but have the sense that that's over now. You know, that there was kind of some point in the past at which, for instance, especially like liturgical change was completed, and now, you know, there's no possibility for it after that. Right. And I think part of what's bound up in that is there's often this kind of reactivity, a reactiveness, reactionariness that a lot of folks have, especially in light of the fact that the world is often chaotic and is addicted to innovation. And so then they see the Orthodox Church and say, ah, here is the place where I am going to be free of all of that. Right? And I certainly agree with that in the sense that the Orthodox tradition is not addicted to innovation, but there is change and there is creativity, and there continues to be creativity. Right. Like, you know, she mentioned the hymn of Cassini. There was a point at which that was not written, and then there was a point which Saint Cassini wrote it, and there was a point in which it was probably just used in her, her monastery. And then, I mean, I don't know the history that the spread of that particular hymn, but it must have started local and then eventually spread. You know, there, there are hymns that the church uses in particular liturgical practice that in many cases are maybe not even a century old. You know, some, some, some of them are, are newer. Right. There's certainly feast days that are new, you know, because there's a new saint or other kinds of feast days sometimes are brought up. But I mean, she asked about the kind of mechanism by which it happens. Largely, it's bishops making pastoral decisions that they feel that are appropriate. Most of them are relatively minor, but sometimes there actually is liturgical reform on a moderately large level. Like, you know, we can think, for instance, of the, the Niconian Church reforms in Russia, which are, were of course, hugely controversial, but basically did stick. I mean, that's essentially the form of Russian Orthodox liturgical life. Now, were those, those reforms from several centuries ago? But, you know, even before that, St. Philothius Kokinos, who is the Patriarch of Constantinople, who canonized St. Gregory Palamas, he was a liturgical reformer. Now, the kinds of reforms that they did were not some massive replacement of the liturgical tradition, but there were still changes. Right? And of course, we can think of canonical shifts that happen, you know, early on, canonical uses of Scriptures, there was more variation probably than there is now. And I think sometimes seeing those kinds of consensuses emerge is what gives people the temptation to think the change stops. In some cases, I doubt there's going to be any changes in church canons. But what happens if the Church of Greece and the Church of Russia get together and say, hey, let's go ahead and have the same Old Testament canon, even though they don't currently, if they made that decision, if the Greek church said, okay, we'll take 4th Esdras, I don't think that would be a problem. But I mean, but largely it's pastoral stuff like that, it's ultimately in the hands of the episcopacy. This is their job. They can be creative. They can bless creativity. Sometimes you see changes happen because one parish has a practice and another parish doesn't. They think it's cool, and they go ahead and adopt it. They find it meaningful and good, and then it spreads and it becomes a thing. Right. So I don't know. I mean, there's. There's. There's a lot of ways that it happens. I would not say that it's always very tiny and incremental because, like I said, there are sometimes programs of liturgical reform. They're not usually, like, on the level, frankly, of that we saw in the post Vatican II era in the Roman Catholic Church, almost never. I. I mean, I'm not a liturgical historian, but from the liturgical history that I know, you don't see that level of change in the Orthodox Church, but there are sometimes fairly systemic changes that do occur.

I'm from Portland, Oregon. I have a question about the body and gender. In your episode God's Body, you define the body as a nexus of potentialities. In the recent episode Profit Motive, there's some references made to individuals accessing spiritual forces from the liminal between gender state or sometimes being thrust out of a gender state as a result of exposure to spiritual forces. In my work as a professional counselor sometimes talked with trans and non binary individuals who describe the experience of their internal sense of gender being incongruent with their body to some degree. They describe grabbing energy, craving a different sort of body. And this incongruence can be mild or extreme, but centers on how they experience their bodies. So then, what is the potentiality of a male body versus female body? And is it strictly or primarily reproduction? Or is there more? What is the essential nature of man or woman? Is the essential nature of man or woman that they have particular genitalia or is the essence of manhood or womanhood something deeper and intangible? And if the essence of gender is in fact connected to particular genitals, then what does that say about the overall nature of a person? Is our central nature bound up in organs of elimination and reproduction? And is this possibly reductionistic? More so, if the essence of manhood, womanhood is bound up in the genitalia, then what does this say about the nature of God? On the other hand, if the essence of gender is not specifically tied to physical genitalia, but rather something internal inherent in transcending physical flesh, then what is actually problematic about a true trans or non binary persons experience journey and physical alterations to their body? That's my question. Thanks so much for the show. It makes being a Christian a whole lot more fun. Peace."}

Well, yeah, I think this is a tough one because there's so many potential minefields and pitfalls, you know, that that can go along with it. And I think often, and I appreciate the spirit with which Moses you asked this question because you know, you're concerned about the care of people, right? Whereas a lot of times when people ask questions related to now this very, very hot question of gender, it's about justifying frankly, sexual immorality or all kinds of other very problematic behaviors. I mean, we've talked many times on this show about this question of identity becoming one's personal identity. I'm different from everybody else for the following list of reasons that together make me unique as being a very problematic way to live. And that at least is some of the way that I think about this stuff. But I'll be honest, I don't have a lot of really big form thoughts about how to understand this. I have very clear thoughts about the right kinds of behavior, you know, but I don't, I don't, I don't yet have fully worked out ideas about necessarily how we get there. So, Father, I'm just going to kick it over you and I want to hear what you have to say about this."}

I'll be curious to see if there's anyone out there. So, yeah, so part of, again, we have to start by interrogating the question a little because as we said before, sort of the way you start an inquiry is going to shape the results you get. Yeah, Right. And so there's something that happened, right. There were important distinctions that were made in the late mid 20th century that have kind of been lost now and are part of what's causing a lot of this confusion.

There are also intersex people for various reasons, genetic issues, other things. There are people who physiologically don't conform to one of those two. Those are people who have their own set of issues they face and struggles they face. And I frankly find it kind of offensive when they're used as like a political football in these arguments. So the existence of intersex people literally has no, nothing to do with transgenderism because this is a question of biological sex, and transgenderism is about gender, which is a different thing."}

Right. We didn't used to make a big deal out of this. Lots of women were tomboys in some period of their growing up, right. And they liked things that our culture associated with boys. They liked sports or they liked playing with what we considered to be boys, toys, not a big deal. That didn't make them a boy. It didn't make them a man. Why? Well, because that's just social construct that has nothing to do with biology. Right. We were very clear this person is biologically this. Right. They, they happen to like some things that in our society are more commonly liked by the other sex. Right. So the other, in terms of ground clearing, the other issue here, and this even came out in the question a little bit, is that. And the questioner at least sounded like, you know, we're not allowed to assume anymore, but sounded like a man. And so he talked about genitalia for men. It's very easy to talk about reproduction in terms of genitalia because that's how men are involved in reproduction. But for a woman, most of what's involved in reproduction is carrying a new human being in their womb for nine months. And so the, the, the reproductive structures of the body, especially if we, as best I can, because I'm not one look at it from a woman's perspective, is much more involved than just their, their organs of reproduction and elimination that there is more involved here. And that's not sort of the end of physiological differences between men and women. And so when we say that a body is a collection of potentialities and Powers, Right. So obviously, there are some of those that are different. Right. A big, glaringly obvious one is that men don't have wombs. Right. They. They can't conceive and carry a child for nine months. Right. That's a potentiality. That's a power that they do not possess and that women do possess. Again, that doesn't mean that every woman. Right. Possesses it because we're. We're in a fallen world where there are disorders of the body, righteousness, there are disorders of the soul, there's disease, there are problems where things don't work. But the structures, the physiological structures are aimed at that possessed by women and not. And not by. Not by men. We've also said and tried to make clear that your soul is not a thing separate from your body. Your soul is the life that is in your body. You are your body. The resurrection is physical. After the resurrection, Christ is still a man, Right. His body is still a male body. A male human body. Yep. So that is. Right. Those structures are. Our physical structures are not sort of ancillary. Right. We have to get past this is a Plato brain thing, that our real self is this spherical thing inhabiting our body, and our body is coincidental. Right. We are our body just as much as we are our soul."}

And we haven't taken into account what having all of a person's sexual experiences be disembodied does to a person when they're first developing their concept of sexuality and identity. Yeah, but we're seeing it play out, right? Because if you don't form your sense of identity in community, right. Then your identity, if you're just talking about yourself, is a black hole.

And once you're in a community, your identity gets formed because you have a role within that community. You have gifts and abilities that you share with that community. And then in return, the community places certain responsibilities upon you. And you contributing what you can and fulfilling those responsibilities gives you a sense of self and a sense of self worth and a sense of being appreciated, and that makes for a healthy person. Right. But we can't argue at people out of this while they're sitting alone in their room in front of a computer. No matter what you post on Twitter, you're not gonna convince anybody of anything and you're not gonna help them.

You know, I have to be careful how I say this, but I've had experience with a young person, so. A teenager who. It's like you said, this person was raised Basically in front of a screen and came to. And came to say, I'm not the actual sex, that I was born, I'm the other one. And I thought about. I looked at that person's life and I thought about, well, okay, so in this case, it was a girl who said that she was a boy. And I thought about. I looked at her life and I thought, well, she's never had a dad. Dad was out of the picture from a very, very early age and has been at home for either in public schools where a lot of those things are. Let's be honest, a lot of public schools these days are totally happy with. If someone says that kind of thing, to say, okay, we will help you and support you to be that way and to help. Help you go down that path as far as you want to go. You know, that's just reality and not getting. Not getting anything different at home and sort of realizing like, okay, this person actually doesn't even know what a man is. And they think. And, you know, she thinks. Think she is one, but there's nothing manly about her. You know, like, literally there's nothing, man. Not even. Not even this kind of, you know, gender stereotyping stuff. Right? It was just sort of like an identification, like a switch was flipped. You know, it's not like she started dressing differently or anything like that, you know. But I think you're right. I mean, from my experience, there's the. This is the result of. This is the result of the frank fragmentation and the breakdown of human communities. And the place of sanity has to be the church. And like you said that it can't be that sanity is not simply giving people lectures about how they're wrong about stuff, but actually creating a community that they can plug into and enter into that web of relationships where who they are as God created them to be is meaningful and is something that they can actually connect to because in many cases they haven't been able. And I'm sure there's a lot of different kinds of experiences. The one that I happen to have interacted with, with this. This young lady is not universal. I know. You know, but. But the cure for this kind of stuff is. Is a scene, community where someone can plug into that and be. And be part of it. It's always, you know, it's always in isolation that we often in isolation, I should say that we really, really go off the. Off the deep end and get in danger waters. So. All right, well, I hope that's helpful to you, Moses, in your work. Okay, so this next one comes from our friend Kyle from Ireland. He is called into the show on multiple occasions."}

It might even be called a legal vision of salvation. I bring this passage to your attention because often in orthodox circles, we see salvation as healing. Talk of salvation as debt or other legal terms is usually derogatorily referred to as Catholic or Protestant. As the above passage illustrates, though, there is something clearly more going on. I know that on the show we've talked about justice as being setting things in their right order, and I can see how this is related to healing, example, placing bones back in their joints. But I'm not sure how to make more sense of the passage than that. So my question is, is there a more authentically orthodox version of salvation as a legal concept? Can you please just riff on this idea? Thank you."}

Right. So, yeah, I mean, that, that kind of stuff is there, but I, I think, I mean, I, I, the way that I read this that makes the most sense to me is that, you know, debt is so, so much bound. I mean, you made mention of debtors, prisons, but I mean, debt is so much bound up, especially in the Roman Empire with the institution of slavery, which is another very, very common image used in the New Testament for our relationship to sin. Right. That it's slavery, and it's slavery to demonic powers, which is of course then referenced in verse 15. Right. Disarming the rulers and authorities, he has made a public disgrace to them, triumphing over them by the cross. And so then this indebtedness that we have for Christ to pay that debt or to tear up the debt as it is in this particular passage, or nailing it to the cross. Right. Is to release us from that slavery that's gone that way. And I mean, my take is that legal language and find, you know, indebtedness language, whether they're bound up together or not, like that stuff is in scripture. The question. And he made mention of how a lot of orthodox people will say, no, salvation is healing. It has nothing to do with this sort of other kind of language. But I think that that's a problem, that when orthodox people talk that way, it's a problem because it's throwing out some biblical language in favor of other biblical language, which is the problem with the other side of the question that says no, it's practically primarily a legal issue is it's throwing out other biblical language in favor of that biblical language. And so you get this truncated view either way. Right."}

I haven't even said primarily. Yeah, that's way down the chain. Right. So being set free from bodyless powers, being raised from the dead, and being purified from Sin and its effects, Right, right. That's what we talk about salvation being on this show. Now, the purification of sin and its effects, you know, healing covers part of that. Right. But when we talk about atonement, right, The. The purification from sin and its effects is so that we can be filled with the Holy Spirit, with the presence of God. It's the beginning of theosis and transformation. Right. In a positive sense, not just healing. Right. So, yeah, all of that is way watered down. So in answer to the final form of the question, well, yeah, it's a lot more than healing, and that's what we've always said. But yeah, and then the other thing with this wiggle between debt and legal. Right."}

Orthodox people, some of them are friends of mine, and sometimes they feel the need because they're using Western liturgical usages to also try to defend bits and bobs of Western theology unnecessarily. And so we want to try to throw people bone. And so using a legal is sort of this broad category that covers 12 things that we could say, well, yeah, we think there's some legal imagery there. Now, by legal, we mean something totally different than what, say, penal substitution area atonement or satisfaction theory means. But it's still legal, so we could be friends. And to me, that's. That's just paper papering over actual differences. Right. So as you mentioned that the word there in Greek actually refers to a promissory."}

And this is connected to St. Paul's common imagery. Wages of sin is death. Right. So we have brought this upon ourselves. Again, it's not a death penalty. Right. And that's proved by the way, St. Paul Elsewhere in Romans uses the term wages, Right? He said, if salvation was wages, it would not be grace, it would not be the work of God, it would be something you earn. Right. So when he says the wages of sin is death, that means death is something we earn, not the action of God, apart from our own actions, meaning it's not a death penalty. St. Paul Straight says that, okay, so this is. And if you read Hebrews, which is at least Pauline, even if you don't want to call it St. Paul's Epistle to the Hebrews, which I'm comfortable doing, but if. Even if you're not, it's at least Pauline, it talks about how we, through the fear of death, have been enslaved our whole lives by the devil, who holds the power of death, who Christ came and defeated. So as you said, this is about freedom from slavery, right to sin and death, which Christ accomplishes on our behalf. And that's not, again, a legal matter. It's not that there's a court case between the devil and Christ, and Christ, like, wins the civil case and therefore becomes the holder of our debt and tears it. Right, that's not the imagery that's being used. Yeah, right. The imagery is, is Christ saving us from the consequences of our actions, which we've richly earned. Right. But that are part of the natural consequence of what happens when we give ourselves over to sin and rebellion and, and follow the demons. So, like, I don't, I just, I don't feel the need to find a way to agree with Anselm. I don't feel a need to find a way to partially agree with John Calvin about penal substitutionary atonement. I just don't, I just don't. I don't need to be free. And I'm sorry if that upsets people who do agree with them, but just, I don't, I don't see any, any positive to it."}

I can't do it. I'm just a total pansy in that regard. Yeah, so I guess, like, the way that I would sort of restate his question would be okay. It seems in the Bible the cosmology that's presented has got three levels. You've got the heavens above us, you've got the Earth that we live on, and you've got the underworld underneath us. I should point out, by the way, that the middle part is referred to as Middle Earth in pre modern Germanic literature. Just putting that out there, Midengyard. But. And then, you know, and then now we've got, you know, we live long after comparison, Copernicus and all that kind of stuff. And we know that that's not the way that things are shaped. Do we actually believe that that's what's presented in the Bible? If that really is the case, then what do we do with that? The fact that we know now that that's not how the world is actually arranged. So here's my understanding of that. My understanding, understanding is that you actually do, in some cases in the ancient world, you get people who seem to hold to more than one cosmology at a time, right. On the one hand, they sort of will say the Earth is, is round, which a lot of them had figured out, like with the use of, of geometry. Right. They could tell that the Earth was round and then at the same time also describe the Earth in three tiered cosmological terms, which suggests that they didn't see them as contradictory models, that they're essentially describing two different sets of experiences that are related to the same reality, but are two different ways of kind of talking about it. But it's also my understanding that you do get, at various points in time, certain people who very much push a kind of a total, even materialization of the three tier version of cosmology. And say this is the way that the world simply is laid out. For my part, I have no problem believing in both at the same time that the three tier cosmology describes something like what we would describe as a spiritual experience. And it's not about an empirical material measurement. And then you can take an empirical material measurement and see, you know, planets that are basically spheres going around the sun, which is itself part of a galaxy and all that kind of thing, and that both are meaningful models and both apply. Right, both apply to actual phenomenological experiences that people have. I know that that's, that's my understanding of it. And I, and I would say that I don't think, even if it is the case that the Bible teaches only a three tier cosmology. And I have to say I have to defer to you on this, whether that's all that's said there, Father. But even if it does teach that, I don't see that that's a problem for believing that the Bible is inspired. Because the Bible isn't trying to answer material empirical questions about planets and astronomy and so forth. That's not what it's purpose is. Instead it's talking about the actual experiences that people have and their experience of God within that and of the world and so forth. So that's my set of thoughts that I have about this."}

So overlaying Leviathan swallows, Jonah swims down beneath the pillars of the earth. Right. Like no one was claiming, there are actually pillars there supported by nothing supporting the earth. Right. That's sacred geography. How those things, how those things that overlap though with real geography or material geography, I should say. So there's that that complicates it. There's also, as we talked about in the how to and how not to Read the Bible episode, the fact that the Bible does not make scientific claims ever at all. Right. So trying to read it from the perspective of modern science is fundamentally cattywampus, Right? And that's not saying science is bad. Right? Go to science. Right. But like, if what you're really into studying is ancient textiles, great, go get your PhD in history, study ancient textiles. But if you try to read the Bible from the perspective of textiles, you might have some interesting insights here and there. Be willing to hear. But on the whole, you're not really going to get the thrust of what the Bible wants to teach you. The Same thing if you try to read the Bible from the perspective of astrophysics, you might have some interesting insights here and there, but you're not going to get right the thrust because it's not making claims from that, that perspective. That's not the discourse that's taking place in, in scripture. And then of course, there's, you know, what, what would you expect God to say to Bronze Age people? Right? So we all have a little bit of 19th century German in US where we have this assumption that we stand at the pinnacle of history and that includes science. So we've got this all, or pretty much all locked down, right. In terms of science. And so if God were really going to speak, he'd communicate in our scientific terms because we're at the pinnacle of human history."}

Right. The reality is if God actually explained the world to Bronze Age people the way it actually is, we still wouldn't understand it. Right. Because if there's a humanity in this age 2000 years from now, we will probably look at today's science like, like we were a bunch of idiots. The way modern people look at, you know, medieval science and alchemy. Right. There will be all kinds of things that we think are horrific and stupid. Right. About our current science. So that whole chain of argument is based on this sort of modernist hubris and doesn't hold up and make a lot of sense. Right. So the reality is God had things that he wanted to communicate to Bronze Age people, and so he spoke to them in a language that existed at the time and in ways using metaphors and descriptions that they would understand so that he could convey to them what he wanted to convey."}
