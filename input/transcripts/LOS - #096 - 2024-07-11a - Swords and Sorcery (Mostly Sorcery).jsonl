And he will be the light of the nations and the hope of those whose hearts are troubled. All who dwell on the earth will fall down and worship him. And they will praise and bless and celebrate with song the lord of spirits. First Enoch, chapter 48, verses 4 through 5. The modern world doesn't acknowledge, but is nevertheless haunted by spirits, angels, demons and saints. In our time, many yearn to break free of the prison of a flat secular materialism, to see and to know reality as it truly is. What is this spiritual reality like? How do we engage with it? Well, how do we permeate everyday life with spiritual presence? Orthodox Christian priests Father Andrew Stephen Damick and Fr. Stephen DeYoung host. This live call in show focused on enchantment in creation, the the union of the seen and unseen as made by God and experienced by mankind throughout history. Welcome to the Lord of Spirits."}

Actual magic that doesn't involve my cocaine, which is the correct way to pronounce his name. Yeah. So magic in the ancient world. Broad topic because there's a bunch of sort of subcategories of magic. This isn't like. Well, it isn't exactly like. Like Dungeons and Dragons magic. Right. Where you've got sort of schools of magic and classes of spells. We're not talking about that really, but there are a variety of phenomena that could be described. In the ancient world really is sort of para religious in the sense that it involves spiritual entities and sometimes even gods and goddesses. But it's something that primarily takes place outside of the formal priesthood. Those lines blur sometimes. Especially the further you go back, the blurrier those lines get between formal priesthood and magical practitioner. But by the time you get to, for example, the Roman Empire. These are different categories. But so we're really talking about a whole bunch of different para religious phenomena that we're grouping together. And so it's not so much here's the schools of magic as it is here are the different types of phenomena that we're grouping into this one big category."}

What justifies grouping them all together is that there are overarching things we can say about the character of all these phenomena that unite them legitimately into this category. And at the broadest level, when we're talking about magic, we're talking about the manipulation of spirits. Right. So spiritual beings that have agency and personality, the manipulation of them by way of certain techniques. And what's going to primarily distinguish between the different types of phenomena that we talk about in this category is primarily going to be differences of technique. So these are all ways of interfacing with these spiritual beings which are to some degree outside the general nature of the sacrificial priesthood within these cultures."}

Right. Because it's these different forms of techne, it's not a role. So the priesthood is a role that a person plays a, within a social construct. Right. It's. It's a role you play with regard to your society and your culture. Whereas because this is a sort of techne, anyone who learns it. Right. Anyone who has access to this knowledge and to these techniques can then at least hypothetically practice it, can practice those techniques, which means it's not going to be limited in the same way. And the places where you see the most overlap, this is the real reason why there's so much overlap between the institutional priesthood, as we might call it magical practitioners early on, like in Sumeria or in very early Egypt, is because of the infinitesimal literacy rate."}

Right. Where education on any kind of broad basis is negligible, where literacy rates are negligible, where literacy is basically confined to a, an institutional priesthood as it was, for example, in the Old Kingdom in Egypt, then those are going to be the only ones who have access to sort of magical stuff. Right. To these, these kind of secrets and techniques. These also. In terms of. So the last episode we went and did some review and revisiting of devil figures. We talked about Azazel and therefore touched on the Watcher story, again from the Anakic literature. Because this is why you see their things like sorcery and witchcraft and making of potions and divination in there alongside like metallurgy."}

One person can chant something, one person can make something, one person can draw something. You could do the procedure. Right. As a, as a solo practitioner. So just saying ritual doesn't mean necessarily big elaborate hoo ha, right. Out in the woods or something. But so there are these ritual elements, there are material elements that get involved as we'll see as we talk about some of these different types of magic. So the first one of these, the first category, sort of broad category we want to talk about is going to strike people as funny right off the bat from a biblical perspective, because they're not used to thinking of it this way. But the first category is really signs and wonders, AKA miracles."}

We're not saying they're Miracle Max. Right. Where what designates this when it is magic. Right.

Even he, you notice the way he talks about his miracles, like in St. John's Gospel, right. That Christ says he's doing the Father's works, right. Because he wants to make clear.

But so that's one type. And there are. We'll talk about this more in the context of the New Testament also. But even outside of that, completely outside of that, you can find in the ancient world plenty of wonder workers and sorcerers and people who are supposed to be able to do this. Right. Apollonius of Tiana is the one that lots of skeptical New Testament types like to bring up because he was a rough contemporary of Jesus who was supposed to have done a bunch of miracles. And they think that's going to be a big problem for us. Right. It's like, oh, darn it, Christianity. All Falls apart because someone other than Jesus did a miracle. What?"}

But so that's one sort of category, right? These, these figures who, for whatever reason, and there were different reasons why they said so. Some of them, they would say, you know, oh, they were basically partially divine themselves. Right. And so that meant they had this power or authority or they had just acquired the ability to do it. They had been empowered in some way that they could do this. They were just great souled. Right. And that allowed them to do this. Right.

And so the kind of knowledge we're talking about here and the kind of texts we're talking about here would be these sort of catalogs of different spirits, what those spirits would do, ways in which you could summon or manipulate them, their names which you could use in some cases to get them to do certain things or to protect yourself from them. All of these kind of things fell into that. That category. And so there are these sort of catalogs we'll see a lot of when we get to the third half, we're going to be talking about sort of the legacy this. And how a lot of this stuff has stuck around in culture. You can probably already think of ways in which that kind of thing stuck around. But. Yeah, so that's what that's about. That's about dealing sort of directly with spirits. The next category, one of the most popular categories, we're gonna get to another category that's the actual most popular category, but one very major category in the ancient world. More major than those first two. Right. Like wonder workers, you get the occasional wonderworker. Right. It's not like every village had a miracle guy and you Know, not every village had somebody who had cataloged all of these local spirits, but almost every community in the ancient world had somebody who practiced divination in some way."}

As we talked about, we won't do the long quote from Philo again because I think we've done it four or five times in different episodes.

So there's a tension there all the time. Right. And ultimately, the more important you were, the more doomed you were. So lots of reasons not to want to be important in the ancient world. So then probably the most popular form of this magic is actually alchemy. But this is alchemy more broadly considered than you're probably used to thinking about it.

Right. This is basically. But that's a substance. Right. It wasn't just that there were, of course, things that were supposed to make you healthy or make you younger. Right. At least make you look that way, all these sort of things. But these were seen to be manipulating spiritual forces to do this through tinctures and different combinations of things. Pharmakea is also under this. It's often translated sorcery. But primarily that's related to, like, hallucinogens, which were discovered very early. And hallucinogens were used to enter into the spiritual world, to enter into the world of dreams and interact there with spiritual beings that they didn't call machine elves at the time because they didn't have machines or elves, but. But probably the same little dudes. And then amulets, which were probably the most common, if you want the number one most common magical thing, magical practice of the ancient world. It was amulets, which includes pendants, rings, other talismans you could wear on your body. And those would either ward off some spirit that you wanted warded off or cause some spirit to protect you from something else. Like arrows. Right. Like if you're going into battle. And the idea was one of the most common ones in the Greek and Roman worlds were Medusa faces. They'd not only be worn, but they put them, for example, on shields, on armor when going into battle. And Medusa was a priestess, we all know what priestess is a euphemism for in the ancient world, who was apparently incredibly beautiful and a couple of goddesses got jealous of her, and so they cursed her and gave her snakes for hair and made her hideous."}

Not even your whole priesthood, like a subset of Your religious priesthood that are lectors, Right. Who know how to read, who are literate and who have access to ancient tablets and scrolls and that kind of thing. But as it develops, right, you get sort of official magical practitioners, what we might call official practitioners, and then unofficial practitioners. And this isn't official and unofficial, like dragon age or something, or dragonlance. It's not like you had to have a license to practice magic. Right, Right. Only these people are allowed to do it.

Like I mentioned, the Senate had official haruspices. And if you were. This actually comes up at one point in the Book of Acts. We won't go into detail right now about it, but in the Book of Acts, it actually comes up at one point that because, like, local governors, procurators in the Roman Empire didn't have access to the Senate's official haruspices or exorcies, and so they had to try and employ locals to do their divination and augury because the official guys only worked for the. The senate. The emperor. Right."}

You'd read a few omens and whatever you said would actually be right and happen. And so you get this reputation. And so people from the neighboring villages and stuff would come see you when they had questions and pay you something to tell them. Right? And then there were also just people who didn't even take money. Just, you know, there's some old woman in the village, you know, who knows how to do something, right?

So the reason the Urim and Thummim are given is precisely to try to stop the Israelites from doing divination. And so there's sort of this whole process outlined in the Torah of how to determine God's will in terms of what they should do. And sort of. Then the last guests are like, okay, we've done this whole process. We've asked everybody, we're supposed to ask. We've prayed, we've done this, we've done that, we've done all the things and we're still not sure. Right. Then God says, okay, then throw the Urim and Thummim.

Don't go and start doing any of this other stuff that the nations are doing here. Do this. Right. And so I would say the reason we don't see anything similar to that in the church is that part of what the Holy Spirit does in terms of not just the leadership structures of the church, but the church as a whole is. Right. Write the Torah on our heart. Right. Give us the wisdom of God so that we can figure things out and we don't have to resort to that."}

So I'm going to read verses 15 through 22. The Lord your God will raise up for you a prophet like me, from among you, from your brothers. It is to him you shall listen, just as you desire, the Lord your God. At Horeb, on the day of the assembly, when you said, let me not hear again the voice of the Lord my God, or see his great fire anymore, lest I die. And the Lord said to me, they are right in what they have spoken. I will raise up for them a prophet like you from among their brothers, and I will put my words in his mouth, and he shall speak to them all that I command him. And whoever will not listen to my words that he shall speak in my name, I myself will require it of him. But the prophet who presumes to speak a word in my name that I have not commanded him to speak, or who speaks in the name of other gods, that same prophet shall die. And if you say in your heart, how may we know the word that the Lord has not spoken? When a prophet speaks in the name of the Lord, if the word does not come to pass or come true, that is a word that the Lord has not spoken. The prophet has spoken it presumptuously.

Which every time you try to start a Sunday school, everybody quotes that back to you. But because there is this more serious judgment for them, there is that accountability there. But on the other side, then the people are called to obey that accountable authority as the person sent by God to lead them, rather than trying to go out and voodoo this stuff sort of on their own cognizance. And I do have to put a note. Sorry, charismatic friends. Okay. But I think we talked about this a little back in the profit motive episode.

It makes no sense. Like everything in the New Covenant is elevated superior to the Old Covenant. That's the whole idea of the New Covenant.

It's that one should not take some kind of miracle or what you might think of as a supernatural event and say, oh, this means that the person who did this or who seems to be the instrument of this, that we should follow them and everything they do is the real is, is good and holy. Right. Like a lot of different, not just Christian groups have miracles going on in them, but there are plenty of testimonies to non Christian religions of our own era, miraculous things happening. And the idea that you could point to one of those and say, ah, we are correct, you know, no, that's not how you do it. And I mean, it's notable that while people can have their faith inspired or encouraged or whatever by experiencing something miraculous in the Orthodox church, the church does not like, put up a big billboard to a miracle. I mean, there is, for instance, not too far from where I live, there is a MER streaming icon. And they actually forbid taking photographs in the church. I mean, they could probably make money off of that if they wanted to. Right. You know, and attract as many people as possible, get the, you know, to put a lot of money in the, in the basket.

So this is Acts, chapter 8, starting with verse 9. But there was a man named Simon who had previously practiced magic in the city and amazed the people of Samaria, saying that he himself was somebody great. They all paid attention to him from the least to the greatest, saying this man is the power of God that is called great. And they paid attention to him because for a long time he'd amazed them with his magic. But when they believed Philip as he preached the good news about the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women. Even Simon himself believed. And after being baptized, he continued with Philip and seeing signs and great miracles performed, he was amazed. Now, when the apostles at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent to them Peter and John, who came down and prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit, for he had not yet fallen on any of them. But they had only been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. Then they laid their hands on them and they received the Holy Spirit. Now when Simon saw that the Spirit was given through the laying on of the apostles hands, he offered them money saying, give me this power also so that anyone on whom I lay my hands may receive the Holy Spirit. But Peter said to him, may your silver perish with you because you thought you could obtain the gift of God with money. You have neither part nor lot in this matter, for your heart is not right before God. Repent therefore of this wickedness of yours and pray to the Lord that if possible, the intent of your heart may be forgiven you. For I see that you are in the gall of bitterness and in the bond of iniquity. And Simon answered, pray for me to the Lord that nothing of what you have said may come upon me. So that's what's in Acts 8."}

And there's some quasi gnostic elements of it. For example, they have sort of God who's the, you know, true one, apophatic kind of vaguely Platonic God. And then he has this emanation, which is his first thought. And his first thought is female. And so this female first thought goes to create the angels. Right. Who are going to be like the next step down from this female first thought. But when she creates the angels, the angels rebel against her and the angels go and create the material world and imprison her in it. And she's imprisoned in the material world in a cycle of reincarnation. So she keeps being born, living and dying, over and over and over again. And she was Helen of Troy most famously. But in the first century A.D. she was Helen, a Phoenician prostitute who Simon met. So where does Simon Magus fit into this? Well, Simon proclaimed that he was God whose first thought she was, who had been incarnate as Simon in the world to go and rescue her. And so Simon's followers thought. Well, by becoming his followers and doing what he asked us to do, when he escapes from this material world with her, he'll take us with him. Right. So that's what they were teaching. So you could see why they would look at him a. As an Antichrist figure. Yeah, right. You can see what's being referred to when they talk about him saying that he himself was somebody great. Right. And the people saying this man is the power of God. That is called great. Right. That's what that's alluding to. Right. That's alluding to that story. Right. So, yes, Simon Magus, crazy cult leader of the first century A.D. declared that he was God. And his Phoenician prostitute girlfriend was the first thought that emanated forth from the divine mind in prehistory."}

And this became known to all the residents of Ephesus, both Jews and Greeks. And fear fell upon them all. And the name of the Lord Jesus was extolled Also.

And they are. Right? They are in our world. But multiple times in the New Testament, there's whole bunches of people that have to burn their books and be told not to do this stuff and so forth. So it's. It's simply much more prevalent because no one's a philosophical materialist in the first century. It's just not. Not a thing. You know, people believe in magic, they practice magic.

{"episode_id":"LOS - #096 - 2024-07-11a - Swords and Sorcery (Mostly Sorcery)","start":7194.45,"end":7273.08,"speaker":"Caller Ron","text":"Hi. So first I want to say that this podcast has got me to do things like volunteer at my local homeless shelter once a month, twice during fast season, make food, prepare for that when I go out to lunch with people, pick up the tab. But my question has to do with experiencing a supernatural reality. So, Father Andrew, you just mentioned a murder bearing icon down the street and you previously mentioned many other examples of murdering icons as well as venerating the incorrupt hand of St. Mary Magdalene. I have several friends who've had mystical experiences and encountered Nurbank icons. And I have friends who aren't even religious and have claimed to have seen spirits. And I have another friend, well, coworker, who will admit to being a pure materialist and has told me he has seen ghosts. And then when I reminded me that he was a serialist, he said it was really weird because he doesn't believe in ghosts. Now, yes, many of these experiences come from different sources. Clearly the merving icons are from God spirit. Probably not, but I feel like I live in a purely material reality. So why is it that some people have these miraculous experiences and others do not at all? Does it have to do with the news?"}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #096 - 2024-07-11a - Swords and Sorcery (Mostly Sorcery)","start":7275.49,"end":7482.27,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Yeah, I mean, it's a Good question. I think there's multiple things that one could say. So one of the things that I'll say is that God gives different experiences in life to different people for his purposes. Right. Each one of us is given everything that we need to repent and become a saint. So there's just variation in life. Right. But also I will say that I think people actually have spiritual experiences way more than they may realize, you know, because our culture has taught us to discount, to dismiss this sort of thing. So we're desensitized to it. We're much more likely to write it off to say, you know, it's a bit of. Of mustard or undigested beef. Right. That kind of thing. So I think all of those things are potentially in play. Definitely some people have experiences that are much more palpable than others. Most people's experiences that they describe out loud tend to be, you know, on the edge of something. You know, like on the edge of perception or that sort of thing. That's been my sort of anecdotal experience in that regard. So not as much kind of just blatant in your face sort of stuff. But that stuff does happen. It definitely does happen. I mean, it's not only like, in testimony of the lives of saints or we see in scripture, but I mean, I've talked to people who have definitely had some of those kinds of experiences. And as I mentioned, you know, some of the experiences that I've had are really like when you watch, like, one of the MER streaming icons. Actually two different MER streaming icons that I've encountered. Not only did the icon itself stream mer, right? Which, like, if someone was a super duper skeptic, they could be like, well, that thing is made of wood, and it can be sort of rigged, blah, blah, blah. Okay, sure, if you want to put that on there. But the one that I don't get how you could possibly rig it is in both cases of these icons, the case, the wooden case that they were in, not only itself was sort of sweating myrrh. Like, the case was sweating it on the outside, but the glass on the front, it's not just that it dripped down from the top, which you could say, oh, well, there's some kind of squirter in there, but actually it formed in the middle of the glass and then dripped down. I don't know how you make that happen. Like, how you fake that. I can't imagine. I don't know. Maybe someone knows, But I can't imagine how you do that. But I watched it form so much that we had to continually mop it up. And I watched it get faster during a church service and then slow down at the end. So, I mean, this stuff to me is pretty unmistakable. I mean, it wasn't, like, spectacular in the sense of, like, there were flashing lights or big music or whatever. It was just like, oh, wow, it's streaming. Mir. How about that? You know, that's the experience. And of course, had this amazing fragrance. And, yeah, there's a lot of testimonies of people being healed as well. So I don't know. Father Stephen, what do you think about her question? Why is it that some people seem to have these kinds of experiences and some seem not to?"}

And there have been lots of saints. I mean, people who are saints, pious and devoted to who spent their whole life, you know, in noetic prayer and never had that experience in this life. We don't. We don't always know. Part of it is we have to remember that God knows us better than we know ourselves. We have a way that we think we would react to that kind of thing, but God knows how we would actually react to that kind of thing. And I don't just mean fear. I mean, that fear is an issue. Right. Like, a lot of people are not up for having a dead loved one, like, appear and talk to them. Right. Like, they would just as soon not have that ever happen. Right. But beyond fear, like, there's a danger of pride. There's a danger of developing spiritual delusion. Right. That can come from experiences we all tell. We all will say, oh, no, I wouldn't do that. Right. But God knows whether we do that. God knows whether we'd find, like, with a dead loved one, if we find it comforting or terrifying, you know. Right. All these things. Right. He knows. And so we have to kind of trust his judgment in terms of what he allows us to experience and when in our earthly lives and that he knows sort of what's. What's best in that regard. But it sounds to me from the beginning of your question like you're doing the right kinds of things."}

All right, so first off, thank you so much for taking my call. You guys have helped me out a lot. I am Jewish. I was new age, and at a hippie music festival, I heard the gospel. And shortly after that, I had a. An Acts Chapter 9 kind of moment between me and God. I got zapped with a new heart, and I do a lot of work with kids. My question for you is, I see New age just ramping up like mad. I also was a Zen Buddhist for about 15 years, and I'm seeing an insurgence in mindfulness, New age, tarot card crystals, just everything You. You were talking about. My question would be, how can the body of Christ in general operate in more power? And I don't want to say to attract people, but just to use what God has given to the body. I don't know if this is making sense. I was healed and delivered from drugs and demonic oppression. And, and I see that my. This is just my opinion. And I'm asking how do you think the gifts of the Spirit can be in better use? I guess I'm saying to attract people, to understand who God is in a real way. And if I'm wrong about saying it that way, I'm, you know, I'll take the correction. I was just. That's my opinion and question to you, both of you. So what do you think?"}

I'm trying to think of the best way to put this. I may just. I guess I'll just be blunt so I don't have to think too long. So I think that. That using what you're describing as the gifts of the Spirit to attract people, I don't think is the right way to go in the sense of, hey, look at what we've got. We've got miracles and stuff. You know, I don't know if that's what you mean, but. But I'm definitely against that, however, I mean, certainly when you see the gifts of the Spirit described in the New Testament, it's not only. I mean, I know a lot of people who have Pentecostal and charismatic background and experience. They think of the gifts of the spirits in terms of things like speaking in tongues and faith healing and all this kind of stuff that sort of seems to be supernatural or whatever, but. But actually, like, there's much more important things like love. You know, love is. Love is much higher than even raising the dead. Right. And I mean, I think one of our saints even says that repenting of your sins is a greater miracle than raising the dead."}

Outreach with regards to the gifts of the Spirit, Right. Is. Is repentance on our own part, which is not just sort of this internal thing. Repentance involves like, some of the stuff that our previous caller was talking about. Bethany, you know, was saying, I'm. I've been inspired to do this and this and this. And it was all stuff about sort of ministering to the people around her. Right. And that's, that's what we see turns the empire upside down in the first few centuries of the church. Is people are really noticed. Like, Julian the apostate is mad that Christians are willing to minister to non Christians. And he's like, why can't pagans be like this? He wants pagans to have Christian ethics is his problem. You know, and, and many cases, like there's plagues sweeping through the empire and it was the Christians who went and took care of people even while everyone else was running off to the countryside to avoid the plague, you know, so certainly, I mean, certainly if God gives to a person a gift of wonder working, right. Although it's not like it's a possession of that person, it's God doing it. If God decides to do that stuff through that person, that's what's needed at that moment for that person. But God's will for all of us in terms of our fellow humans around us is pretty straightforward. Love your neighbor as yourself."}

Just what I see is New Age just ramping up. And it's not so much that I want to advertise Jesus with miracles, signs and wonders, but I, I, because I've been healed and emotionally set free and got a new heart like you were talking about. I just, I, I don't know if I, I do agree with you. It's the love and ministering that makes it shines a light. What do you think is the proper place of the gifts in the body?"}

But people are going through the day to other places. The advantage we have when it comes to spirituality is that we have the real deal. If New Age spirituality is thin gruel, then we're serving steak. Right. And so, and that's on all levels. That's on the level of explaining people's spiritual experiences. That's in terms of meaning in the world. That's in terms of as. As Father Andrew said, the, you know, the greatest miracle being the conversion and repentance of a person. One of the. One of the things. So very early on, when I was coming into the orthodox church 20 odd years ago now, one thing that really impressed me is I remember I went and I looked up on some website about a mer streaming icon like Father Andrew was talking about with the previous caller, this miraculous icon that had mer streaming from it. And there were sort of these testimonials of people who had come to see it and come there and prayed. And what impressed me was half the testimonials didn't have anything to do with healing or anything like that. Half the testimonials were talking about, you know, for example, this was in one of the major and especially violent urban areas of the US A grandmother bringing her grandson there who was in a gang, and he repented and left the gang and started coming to church with her and, you know, became a follower of Christ. Like that. That's listed there as. Look at this miracle that happened."}

And what they have in common is this idea that you can use language and thought to manipulate reality. Right. And the way that word faith, guys, packages is they'll say, well, words are like containers, you know, and faith is this substance that, you know, they use that language from the Bible, you know, the faith, the substance of things hoped for or whatever. But like, faith is a substance, like it's a thing that makes things happen in the world. And so that's why, like, if you just decree and declare and really believe and everybody believe with me, then, then things will happen that you want to happen, whether it's wealth or, or miraculous healing or whatever it might be, you know, and you get like the watered down affirmations of people Like Joel Osteen and that kind of stuff.

Our episode on magic, I think. I think that this is very relevant. It's not. Again, you know, this is not just, oh, look, here's some weird esoteric stuff. I mean, you know, cheese sandwich oracles and all. As fun as it is to kind of look at stories like that, I think that especially for people living in the culture that Father Stephen and I live in, you know, 21st century America. And maybe this applies to some people because I know we have people all over the world listening to us. So hello, everybody else. We're so glad you're here. If this applies to your culture too, then I hope that this is helpful. If not, you can just pray for Americans, if you don't mind. I think that this temptation to magic is actually endemic because what is magic about? It's about doing the thing that you need to do in order to get the thing that you want. And especially with a sense that you can control your world, right? And the fact that we have this technological mastery of our world that we think we have. Although, I mean, I think about the poor people right now, I mean, a lot of suffering all over the world. But I think about, for instance, about the poor people in Texas who a lot of them, a lot of them just lost power because of a hurricane. And there's also incredible heat going on right now. That's very dangerous, that combination, because there's not air conditioning to keep, keep people safe. It's not just about comfort safe in extreme heat. You know, we don't really have mastery of the world. We could still definitely be interrupted and overcome even. But I think this temptation of magic is about this sense of mastery, right? And think about Simon Magus. What is it he's trying to do? He's trying to control. He wants the power, so he's willing to pay for it. Probably with a thought to, hey, I can get paid too. You know, this is, this is real pride. This is, this is the attitude that it, this life is about me, what I want. I mean, honestly, this is also what's behind cancel culture. What is cancel culture? At its base, it's. I should not ever have to be exposed to anything that I disagree with, right? Because I need the ultimate control. I should be able to click a button and everything be just fine. That is the temptation to magic. That is a temptation to magic. You know, and it's no surprise to me that as the, as Christian culture collapses, as the meta narrative of Western culture collapses, that there should now be an increase not just of magic in the metaphorical sense or even just the technological sense, but in the actual literal sense. There's people doing rituals to try to make things happen. But whether using a ritual or not, this sort of illusion of control, this desire for control, it's about pride, it's about lust. It, it's really, it's. It's that that is the sin. And you know, we talked at the end about prosperity. Preachers, the word faith and, you know, kind of Oprah spirituality and this stuff. And I, I, as we were talking about that, I, I thought about the example of the saints, because here are people that not only did not look for control, right? It wasn't about being tough and about being, you know, in command of the world. And the opposite, right? The opposite. It was about repentance. About repentance. And what is repentance? Repentance is to be faithful to Christ, to live according to the way that he commanded. Right? That's what repentance is. And if, like in our culture we taught, you know, you should, you should try to change the world, like, everyone can grow up and change the world, number one, I, most of us are not that important. We're not. Like, you can't go out and change the world. I'm sorry, it's just not true. Like, that's. Most people in history will be forgotten. That is the reality, right? Most people are forgotten by the world. They don't change the world. They get forgotten by the world. And it's not because they didn't try hard of. But if you really actually want to change the world, like, if you want to, want to actually make the world better, if you want to bring it closer into the justice and the beauty and the order of God, then the place you start is to repent. A holy person affects everyone around them, but they didn't get holy by doing some formula. They got holy by living humbly. They got holy by repenting of their sins. They got holy by serving other people, by putting themselves last, right? And you know, it's funny, like, there's even this temptation of magic that exists. I mean, this might sound a little esoteric to some people, and if you've never heard any of this, God bless you, I envy you. But there's even temptation to magic that exists amongst some orthodox, like on the Internet, where they'll try to pick apart sacraments, for instance. And unless there's a specific formula or whatever it might be to say nothing about the Church's tradition and history about these things. But like, no, no, no. It's this one model that could, it must do this way, or else you're not orthodox or you're not whatever, you know. And people especially apply this to baptism, frankly, and especially the way that people are received into the church. And that just is a profoundly ignorant view when you look at the actual whole history of the way the Church has dealt with these things. Because the Church is not a magic factory. The church is a place for people to repent. The church is a place for people to become like Christ. And it gets people to that point in a lot of different ways, even though ultimately the path of repentance is the same. If you focus on these formulas, I'm not saying that the way that services are done does not matter. The way the sacraments are done does not matter. It matters, right? It needs to be done in obedience to the church, according to the tradition of the church, all that kind of stuff. I am by no means a reformer, innovator, or any of that stuff. I'm not interested in that. I didn't become orthodox for that. But if you become fixated on a kind of mechanistic understanding, a magical understanding of life in the church, and it doesn't just have to be sacraments. I mean, there are people who have this idea of like, oh, you have to do your piety in this particular way, and church services must be done only in this particular way. And whatever it might be, like, all this kind of focus on particular details like this, as though that it's the details themselves that make it happen. That's magical thinking. That's magical thinking. And it's all about distraction from real repentance. And you can tell that because the spirit that goes along with that magical thinking is usually very harsh, very hard, and does not inspire anyone to actually meet Christ and to repent and to become like him, to love their fellow humans, to put others in front of them, to sacrifice themselves. It doesn't. It doesn't. I've been around long enough to say that I've never seen it work that way. So what is the opposite of magic? Repentance. Repentance is the opposite of magic. Repentance is to let go of control. Repentance is to surrender yourself to Christ and to do his will and not seek to exert your will over other people. All right, rant over."}

You just have to scroll through a bunch of ads. And so this may be a slight overshare, but I generally do this in the morning in the bathroom on my phone. But I don't actually think I'm gonna win a large sum of money. Like, it'd be cool to win $10 million or $5,000 a week for life, but ain't gonna happen, right? And I don't go and do the entry. I do that to waste time and Because I got five bucks a couple of times. Why not, right? I'm not doing it because I seriously think. And I'm putting some kind of hope investment in receiving this kind of. There are folks who have been bamboozled by grifters like Benny Hinn into giving him money in the hopes that they're going to really magically not so much miraculously as magically have money show up in their bank accounts or somehow get some kind of help. They've been told to really believe that's true, and then if it doesn't happen, it's because you didn't believe it hard enough. And I blame the grifter, obviously. I don't so much blame the person because the person's been caught up in a trend in modern life that really has a lot of its roots in Freud, who, through Freudian psychology that's filtered down to all of us, has sort of redefined what a human being is. To a human being being, a desiring thing. It's just a thing that has desires. If you've read any Lacan, you know those desires are always unmet. They can never be met. And so, having defined ourselves in this way and understanding ourselves as these desiring things, we have all of these things that we want that we desire. And those desires and the futile quest to fulfill them just drives us through our whole lives. And if we stop and think, we think about what are the things I think of as problems in my life? What are the things I complain about? What are the things I think would fix everything. If I just had or just this happened, then everything would be perfect. Pretty much every case, it's some desire I have that isn't met. And I think that if it were met, if it could just be met, then everything would be fine. The problem is this unfulfilled desire. And that unfulfilled desire and us seeing it as our problem inevitably twists and distorts us in different ways. To a lot of especially young men. In our culture, the desire for sex, or in some cases a little more wholesomely, the desire for marriage, for having a woman to be a partner, a companion in their life, a wife. That desire not being met twists them until they turn into some kind of weird goblin on the Internet. There are people whose resentment of not having as much money, not having the material things they think they deserve, twists them, destroys their relationships, destroys marriages, destroys families. There are people who so desire success being looked at in a certain way. They pursue their careers and offer their families up on the altar of success. No matter how hard we pursue any of those things, in fact, the harder we pursue a lot of them, the more we realize that we're always going to be lacking and that's never going to be fulfilled. And what that makes is, it makes one of the gifts of the Holy Spirit. One of the things we can only truly find through Christ. It makes it a superpower, and that's contentment. In our current world, contentment is a superpower. Contentment sets you free because contentment isn't having all your desires fulfilled. Contentment involves experiencing the lack, experiencing the fact that there are all these desires you have that are unfulfilled, but being at peace with it. Being at peace with it. That peace brings freedom. And contentment is something we have to practice. It's like patience. We have to practice it over and over and over again. And we get better at it. Meaning we get more and more at peace with not having everything, with not always gratifying our desires. That peace grows over time. And because our society is so oriented the other way, let me tell you, when you try to practice contentment, no one will understand it. You will not be praised for it. If you start to practice contentment, you will be called unambitious, unmotivated, lazy."}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #096 - 2024-07-11a - Swords and Sorcery (Mostly Sorcery)","start":11758.4,"end":11910.84,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Something's wrong with you that you're just content to live like that. Right. But the people who will say that those things about you are the people who are still enslaved by their drives and desires that they're still out there in that futile quest to fulfill. And so seeing you living another way will sort of confuse them, maybe even frighten them, that maybe they're wasting their life because they kind of are. So while I'm not disagreeing with Father Andrew about repentance being the opposite of magic, I think if we practice contentment, we get serious about it. About practicing contentment, being at peace with the things we lack in being at peace with the gifts we have and the gifts we don't. Being at peace with where God has put us in our life and the life that God has given us, maybe even experiencing some joy over all those things. If we practice that, we won't feel any need for magical thinking. We won't feel the need to engage in any esoteric secrets or anything else to try to chase after fulfilling those needs. But again, that that contentment and that peace can only come through Christ because that's the place we can rest. We can rest because there's nothing else we have to sort of achieve. There's no desire of ours that has to be fulfilled. We can be free to do good, to love. When you don't need anything from anyone else, you're free to give to all of them. And that's what actual freedom and joy and peace in the Christian life look like. So that's my anti magic rant. It was less ranty than I was earlier."}
