Haunted by spirits, angels, demons and saints. In our time, many yearn to break free of the prison of a flat secular materialism, to see and to know reality as it truly is. What is this spiritual reality like? How do we engage with it? Well, how do we permeate everyday life with spiritual presence? Orthodox Christian priests Father Andrew Stephen Damick and Fr. Stephen DeYoung host this live call in show focused on enchantment in creation. This the union of the seen and unseen as made by God and experienced by mankind throughout history.

You are listening to the Lord of Spirits podcast. My co Host, Father Stephen DeYoung is with me from Lafayette, Louisiana. And I'm Father Andrew Stephen Damick. And I'm not in Emmaus. That's right. I am in Chesterton Duneland, Indiana itself, AKA the poor man's Ohio Ancient Faith Ministries headquarters. And I am actually in the same room as our very own Matuska Trudy the Tank Richter. So if you hear her giggling in the background, that is the Tank herself, we discovered in the last few days her secret nickname that she had when she was but a callow youth. And we're live. And if you're listening to us live, you can call us at 855-237-2346 and you could talk to us. And we're going to get to your calls in the second half of the show. But I should warn you that I am going to be the one answering your call. So if you call, you're not going to hear the melodious voice of Matuska Trudy the Tank Richter. Instead, you're going to just go straight to hold and we're just gonna have sheer anarchy. So you better behave here on our 100th episode of the Lord of Spirits podcast."}

So this is our hundredth anniversary episode. We're in a celebratory mood, as Father Stephen has said. I do feel drunk with power here being an AFM hq, but we are going to actually talk about real stuff. The word unchanging is a word that's often used to describe Orthodox Christianity. The sinaticon of Orthodoxy even says that Orthodox Christianity is the f faith which is established the universe. A bold statement. Yet if you look at the evidence for Christian worship many centuries ago, it is not exactly the same. As orthodox worship here in the 21st century. And clearly it's very different from what we see in Genesis chapter one. So what does unchanging actually mean? And is there acceptable change? And is this the episode where we finally completely succumb to the pan heresy of ecumenism?"}

Because there is that move to a focus on texts, a more intense focus on texts, a rise in literacy rates, and that does reshape religious practice. We didn't get into this last time because it wasn't strictly on topic, but something very similar happens in terms of the shift of religion within Europe when the Reformation happens and you have the printing press and you have another huge rise in literacy rates that you again have religion becoming more text focused and more intellectualized as a result. Right. So that's something that happens, but that happened not only within paganism, but as we talked about, that happened within Judaism. And that's part of what produces what we call Second Temple Judaism with the synagogue system, with a renewed focus on the text, particularly of the Torah, but then of the other Hebrew scriptures, and then ultimately has continued into Christianity."}

Right. But this isn't the way scriptures have functioned in the history of Judaism and Christianity. There are primary and secondary scriptures within the canon. So it's pretty hard to argue and be taken seriously by anyone that the Torah doesn't occupy a special place within Judaism. Pretty bad all the way through. Right.

Second Temple Jewish writing in general, we talked about within the Second Temple period, there's this burgeoning of all of these other texts sort of around the scriptures that are putting down in writing things that previously had been oral traditions surrounding the scriptures. And these texts were read and used and were treated as Holy books by different communities, but they were always on the level of, here is how we interpret and apply the Torah in most cases within our community.

But, you know, one of the things that actually, I don't know why I started doing this not that long ago. I'm kind of ashamed to admit within just the past couple of years as I'm going to sleep first, of course, you know, we pray to our Lord Jesus Christ to preserve us and to save us. You know, of course, because we could die in our sleep. But also the next thing that I do then is I specifically say, guardian of my soul and body, protect, free me from all assaults of the evil one this night. And then I also add, because I'm a husband and a father, protect my wife and my children. And I name them in that prayer as I'm going to sleep. Because, you know, you go to sleep, that's a kind of a vulnerable position to be in. And you want the guards up and doing their task in the night while you're asleep. And, you know, that is one of the things that we know that the angels do. That's not all that they're about for sure. We're going to be talking a lot more on this show about what angels are about and what they do. One of the things that they do, of course, is to guard us. They keep us from harm. Not just physical harm, but also spiritual harm. Like there is a war going on. There is a war going on. It is a spiritual reality, and we're participating in it. We're either participating in the works of God and becoming more like him, or we're participating in the works of the devil and becoming more like him. Like the biggest aha moments in my conversations with Father Stephen was When he said, you know, that there's basically a thing that's the opposite of theoses, I said, what is that? Demonosis? And he's like, well, I don't know if there's a word for it specifically, but there is. Like, you participate in what God is doing and you become like him. But if you participate in what the dark powers are doing, you become like them, right? So you're always headed in one direction or the other. You don't get to stand still. How do we participate in the reality of our angels? I mean, prayer is the biggest thing, but also just have that sense, I think, especially when you're going to sleep is a good one. But also, you know, when you wake up in the morning to say, help me today, be with me. We're not talking about some kind of flimflammy. I hope angels are watching over you. Like, that's okay to say that, right? But that's kind of not all that they're really about. These are God's armies, his created beings. They're his government in a very real sense. And part of our task is to become like them. The Lord says that the sons of the resurrection, this is in Luke's gospel. Sons of the resurrection become like sons of God and equal to the angels. So we take on their roles. We do the things that they do. Your guardian angel, your patron saint, the one you're named after, the one who's assigned to your parish, is very concerned with the place that your church is in. The beginning is just to acknowledge that, like, they're here. My church is just named after here in Emmaus. Our church is named for the Apostle Paul. It's not just named after the Apostle Paul. He's here. And this place is important to him because we asked God to assign him here. And so we believe that that happens. Love that dream harp, huh?"}

There's another way of kind of looking at church history because I haven't, you know, read the other book, but thank you. When I, yeah, so I, I did watch one of this guy's video about kind of like, I think he was talking about like the infallibility of the scriptures and he was going in a bit about like, what does the Bible say about tradition?

I was kind of, you know, I'm ditching the solas, but I don't kind of understand like where, where things land now with like infallibility and you know, that kind of stuff. So I was wondering if you guys could kind of expand on that idea on and like, kind of, because I don't even remember, like I didn't pay enough attention when I was in Bible college about kind of that whole part of the. Why it became so important to discuss them being infallible. Because I actually was listening to Father Evan Armitas on one of his. I don't know if it was Orthodoxy live or his Bible study, but he talked to something about, he had like a total side comment about that might cause some issue because he said that we don't necessarily hold to the idea or at least the prophecy, understanding of infallibility of the Scriptures.

As we were saying earlier, he's so nice that he makes me look like you. Yeah, it's true. Yeah. This is a great question. And I think, you know, speaking as someone who once, long ago in the before times, was an evangelical, although I'm very happy, like a couple of years ago, the number of years that I was orthodox has now passed up the number of years that I was evangelical, which means I'm no longer a convert. Right. You know, I think that the reason why there's this push for infallibility, this understanding of that the Scriptures need to be understood in terms of this category of infallibility, is because this is understood as kind of a guarantee of their truth. Like, this is the foundation, right. On which the Protestant understanding. And I know I'm generalizing here, but this is generally true. The Protestant understanding about Christianity is the foundation on which it's built. And if you poke holes in the reliability of the Bible, then you have a foundational problem, right? So the category of infallibility is really a philosophical, logical category, right. That there are no errors of any kind, there are no discrepancies of any kind within the texts of the Scriptures. And that's how you know that they're correct. Right. Whereas I would say that the orthodox understanding of the Scriptures is. I wouldn't say that they're fallible. Right? Like, that's the problem is this duality of fallibility versus infallibility. That's part of the problem is that whole structure, right? But they are true. And the way in which they are true is the way in which they function within the community of the church. And I'll also just add, I mean, right before Father Stephen gives his actually. And, you know. But did you ever consider this? I'll also add that we've done a few episodes that are related to this question of how you know the script, how you understand the truth of the Scriptures. And the one that I think is the best place to start is one that we did that was called. Oh, man, I'm blanking on the title. You know what I'm talking about, Father?"}

And then we have another one called something like how, you know, stuff is true or something. Something like that. I don't remember exactly now, but yeah, that's what I would say is this. This problem of infallibility. It's taking a philosophical, logical structure and placing that on top of the Bible. And the big problem with that, of course, is that it's assuming that there's this other standard by which what God has given is measurable, which actually puts something above God himself. Right. If God is being measured against something, then shouldn't you worship that something? Because that's clearly higher than God, you know? Father."}

It's logically incoherent. A text can be authoritative. It could be regarded as an authoritative text. A community can attribute authority to a text. This text is authoritative for us. Right. But the text can't exercise that authority because it can't do anything. It sits on a shelf. It's not an agent. It can't act. A written text. A person has to read it, interpret it, and then act based on their reading and their interpretation. And so there's this basic epistemological problem at the core of Sola scriptura, which is you don't have any access to the contents of Scripture outside of your actually sitting down and reading the scriptures in time and space. Right. Which means even if you want to say, let's yield all the points. It's inerrant and infallible in the sense that the wildest evangelical fundamentalist thinks. Right. That doesn't get you anywhere. Because as soon as I have to read it and interpret it, I'm fallible."}

So, okay, so what is actually being done? This is my understanding of what. What happens in this custom is that an animal, alive animal is brought in and often they're like brought into the church and kind of paraded in front of the aconostasis and then brought outside and slaughtered and cooked and eaten. Right. And so there's Some people that, let's say, see. See. Animal sacrifice. Animal sacrifice. But important discontinuity, as anyone who's been listening to this show for any period of time will know, the thing is not being cut up on a prothesis table, and it is not being put on an altar, and it is not being burned to a God. Right. So it is not traditional animal sacrifice. It does look like some Muslim rituals. So, you know, like the core elements, right, are the idea that people want to have a festal meal and they want it to be blessed. And I think that, like, those things are good. Like, that's good. Right. But I think, though, that this idea of what it is that they're doing, especially bringing the animal into the church, which of course, is expressly forbidden in the canons of the Orthodox Church. Expressly forbidden precisely for this reason, because it's like, wait a minute, what are you going to do with that thing when you bring it in there Now? They're not. They're not actually sacrificing it on the altar, right? They're not, but it looks kind of like they're about to, is part of what's going on. So, yeah, I think the thing to do would be to. To talk to people and say, look, and you can't gather them all together and say, now this is what we're going to be doing. But maybe find the people that are part of that community that are receptive to conversation and to having their understanding stretched a little bit and say, look, what is it that you're looking for out of this? What is the thing that makes this wonderful and meaningful and powerful for you? It's probably not bringing that goat into the building. Probably not. Probably not."}

It is a particular technique of cutting the throat of an animal and saying bismillah while you do it, which simply means in the name of God. That's all that. That means. Now, obviously, that Muslim's understanding of God is very different from mine, but, I mean, if someone wants to say in the name of God while they slaughter an animal, I don't personally have an objection to that, but in any event, I'm going to say a lot of other prayers over that animal that's going to do it, what I needed to do, spiritually speaking.

Brilliant work. I mean, it's a sort of take on the Tower of Babel, actually. So, I mean, the concept of Logris as it functions within that novel, which, you know, Lewis is. He's taking a theme that does exist within Arthurian literature and kind of doing his own take on it. Okay. So it's his own sort of refined, rarefied version of this. All right. Like, if you read Malory, that's not there. If you read, you know, some of the stuff from Middle English, you're not going to see it there. Okay. And definitely not. If you see. If you read the Mabinogian, like, if you read the original, you know. Well, original, ish Welsh versions of these stories, it's not there. But in Lewis's version, Logris is kind of this ideal spiritual Christian England that's kind of present in a certain way. It's sort of like England as it should be. It's an eschatological England. Okay, yeah, yeah, that's what's going on. So it's not, you know, it's the idea of England as ruled by King Arthur, you know, everything in its proper place, all the knights of Camelot doing what they're supposed to be doing, all that sort of stuff. And so, you know, that he is strength, of course, takes place in the modern period. And so therefore it's very much this kind of mythological England also, you know, but it's breaking in is the idea. I mean, Merlin shows up in the, you know, in the story, all that kind of stuff. Like there's this merging together of Arthurian myth and, you know, 1940s England. I mean, it's wild, wild stuff, as you know full well. But, yeah, it's this idea of England as it should be. England as it kind of could be as a Christianized, a re. Christianized England. You know, it's not just nostalgia. Like, you know, things used to be so great back in the day. It's not just that, because the idea is that can be this present reality, but it is thoroughly Christian in its character. You know, it's not utopian. So, yeah, yeah, that's the way that the concept works in the book. And, you know, whether that's like, a good idea. I mean, I think it works very well within the framework of the book. It's necessary within the framework of the book because it's contrasted against the. The civilization that. I'm forgetting the acronym now off the top of my head."}

I think this actually goes to the core. What we've been talking about today goes to the core of what salvation is. And here's how I think that is. My father used to tell me about my grandfather, that at one point, my father was watching the Nuremberg trials on television, which were the trials of Nazi war criminals, so sort of the most demonically evil humans, you know, of our. Of our era. And my father asked my grandfather what he thought about what had happened and these trials. And my grandfather's response was, there but for the grace of God go I. And usually when we say that, we say that about some misfortune. Someone has suffered, someone has ended up homeless, someone has ended up bankrupt, someone has died at a young age. And we say, oh, there for the grace of God go I. It's God's grace that I have the things I have. And that's not untrue. But my grandfather was saying that about becoming a Nazi war criminal. He was saying that about becoming this sort of immoral monster who would murder other people en masse and do these other things. And this is how the Scriptures present the demonic and our sin as participation in the demonic. After Adam and Eve have disobeyed, God says, it's not good that man should live forever. Because if we had, if we lived forever in that state, we would have been just like the demons, immortal and immoral, immortal and evil. And so God gives us this life in this world and our mortality and our repentance to prevent us from suffering that fate. A lot of times our Western Christian friends present salvation as well. God has these laws, we've broken those laws. So he's angry at us or he's compelled by his attribute of justice. He has to punish those violations of the law. And so Christ comes to save us from that. So God has to save us from himself or save us from one of his attributes, save us from his own justice. That's not what the scriptures say. The scriptures say that Christ came to save us from our sins because our sins are destroying us. Our sins are turning us into these demonic monsters if we keep going down that path. So the truth we have here, when we look at these giants who are the far end of where that road leads, who represent someone, not become like God, but become like the demons, dehumanized and inhuman. We see where the path of sin leads. And it shows us that in reality Christ came to save us from ourselves. And it gives us a clarity of exactly what that means. So I think this is important. Beyond all the history and the tying things together in the Old Testament and understanding some of the hymns of the church, that's the core. That's the core that despite our sin and wickedness, which is deliberate, despite our throwing in our lot with these demonic spirits who rebel against and hate God, Christ still loved us enough to come and die and rescue us, redeem us and buy us back so that we could become sons of God. As we've talked about in previous episodes, this shows us the other side. We talked about past episodes, what we're saved to, what we're saved for. This is what we're saved from."}

And I think this is a really important concept for us to grasp. If you do something good, it is good. If you're doing something good. I mean, it seems weird to say that, right? But there's a whole theological world out there that says that unless you check off certain boxes, everything you do is other garbage like that is totally a thing. In certain theological. That's totally a thing. Right. They'll say, oh, your righteousness is this filthy rags. That's not what that means. But a good act is a good act, and every good act is faithfulness to God. And faithfulness to God is cooperating with divine grace. Right. And I mean, to me, one of the prime exhibits of this is in the book of Jonah, right? Jonah goes to Nineveh, of course, having had his arm twisted a lot, he goes to Nineveh and he doesn't even say, you guys, if you don't repent, you know, bad things are going to happen. He just says, in three days Nineveh will be overthrown. Like, he's just. It's just all doom and gloom. And what do the Ninevites do? They repent. And sackcloth and ashes. Right. Interesting, interesting detail, though we're never told. And history bears out that they did not convert from paganism to become worshipers of Yahweh, the God of Israel. Didn't happen. They continue to be Demon worshipping pagans. And yet God not only spares their city because they repented, but then Christ himself in the Gospels, in both Matthew and Luke, holds them up as an example of repentance. And he says, and it's word for word, by the way, in both these Gospels, the men of Nineveh will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it, for they repented of the preaching of Jonah. And behold, something greater than Jonah is here. So it's an interesting point here. A bunch of demon worshiping pagans and there's God in the flesh honoring their repentance and holding them up as an example."}

What do they call, rts? Real time strategy. And, you know, you can play as the Greeks, you can play as the Norse, you can play as the Egyptians. That's in the original version. They add some other civilizations, I think, later. And you have to accumulate. I can't remember what they call it anyways, it's represented by a little lightning symbol. And you have to accumulate that as one of the sort of currencies you can spend on units. And with the Greeks, you have to put people worshiping at a temple in order to get that. With the Norse, it's actually fighting. Fighting gets you more of that. But with the. With the Egyptians, it's monuments. And the bigger the monuments you build, the more that's generated. And of course, the more that you have, then the more that's generated as a result. And I mean, obviously that's a very just sort of reductionist, gamified approach to this kind of thing. But. But, you know, it's not entirely dissimilar from what you just described with the sense that, okay, if you build. If you're the pharaoh and you build the Sphinx, this confirms that you're the pharaoh. It. You know, and then confirming you're the pharaoh gains the obedience and favor of your. Your people. Like, everybody's kind of doing what they're supposed to do. And so therefore Egyptian society works the way that it is supposed to work. Just as predictable and beneficial as the flooding of the Nile."}

But the initial run of Lilith Faire came to the big arena where I often worked during the summer doing concerts. And 1997, actually, I did a whole pile of concerts like, it was the last year of the first run of Lollapalooza. It was the first year of Lilith Faire. And so, you know, so Lilith Fair, of course, was for all of you young people out there. It was a tour of female artists that were a big deal in the mid-1990s, and even some that have been a big deal for much longer than that, among whom, obviously, is Susanna Hoffs.

Doing production work, doing theater, doing concerts. Occasionally stagehands have to move fast. And so I was going somewhere very quickly.

And it's about the translations of words and how they're used today in normal language versus how they were used and have been translated as such. So, for example, we're doing. My priest is leading a study of the Psalms, and we started Psalm 1 this week. And, you know, the first. The first. First Psalm 1. Blessed is the man who walks in the. Not in the council of the ungodly. Now, that's my. That is my orthodox study Bible. But my ancient faith, Psalter says, blessed is the man who walks not in the counsel of the wicked. So, you know, for me, growing up in the south, wicked had a very definite definition. And so just reading it this way, without having my study Bible as well, which the reason I'm even bringing this up is because our priest read it out of the Bible. And I was like, well, that's not what my book says. So I looked it up. How does a layman. How does someone who's just trying to educate themselves not fall into this trap where, you know, this word wicked obviously doesn't mean wicked, as in the evil, like wicked, which of the west type of situation. Right. It means other than God, not God's ways, ungodly. But when you."}

Yeah, but I mean, the point being, right, that when we read the Scriptures, it is okay to read the Scriptures and not have a conversation about every single verse. That's okay. It's okay. But what you shouldn't do is decide that you know exactly what it means and then sort of get puffed up and absolutize your meaning and argue with people about it and realize that in some cases, multiple translations of a single word can give you different aspects of what's going on in the Scriptures. So the Hebrew original is an Orthodox Bible verse, and the Greek translation is an Orthodox Bible verse, and the Slavonic translation is an Orthodox Bible verse. And English translations can be orthodox. And they may all say slightly different things, and that's okay. And they all function within the church to do what needs to be done. So it's really about the whole matrix within which we receive the Scriptures. And it's not only about an isolated, solitary experience of reading the Bible. When you read the Bible as an Orthodox Christian, you read it as an Orthodox Christian with the Orthodox Church, which means that not only do you bring to it your experience of having been in church, your experience of having been taught by your priests and by other teachers, your experience of having been found informed by the church services, your experience of having read the lives of the saints and, you know, whatever else, but also that you are willing to be corrected if you're reading something wrong, you know. So, yeah, I mean, ungodly and wicked, like, to me, really, these are two words that can kind of point to the same direction. Now, in English, wicked lands differently than ungodly, for sure. Right. There's something about that word wicked, but clearly to be ungodly is not good either. I think they just sort of land a little bit differently for an English speaker is my sense of it. So I would say both my biggest fears."}

I'm talking to many Catholic friends, some of whom teach ccd, and I told them about what they call the heroine of hell, we call the heroine of Hades. They had no idea what I was talking about, so I was completely dumbfounded. And I would explain to them what we learned from Holy Saturday and a little bit of the paschal sermon and the icons.

You know, lift up your gates, so ye princes be lifted up, ye everlasting gates, and the King of glory shall enter. And who is the king of glory? The Lord, strong and mighty. The Lord mighty in war. Right. So that has been understood by the church as about Christ coming in and busting up the dark Lord's hood. So there's that. And then there's, of course, also the references to the Holy One not seeing corruption in the grave. But, like, the real fleshing out of this is. Is not. Is not explicit in the Scripture. You get the dramatization that's in what's called the. The Gospel of Nicodemus or the Acts of Pontius Pilate, which is my favorite iteration of that. And, you know, there's a lot of the liturgical material. But I mean. I mean, Roman Catholic catechists, you guys, like, come on, know your own tradition. Hello."}

My impression is that their tradition about this is mostly basically the same thing as ours, at least. Yeah, sort of. But, like, their art, for instance, never depicts, like, a pitched battle. It does depict Jesus flattening Satan with the gates of Hades. It does, right. One of my favorites is the painting by Hieronymus Bosch where you see this really dark, evil, hellish place, and then there's this.

We're not going to tell. You get it from us. You support publishers and authors better when you buy things directly from the publisher. That is God's own honest truth. Right. So this episode has been about change in the Christian religion, change in the religion of the worship of the one true God, and what constitutes legitimate and illegitimate change. And I wanted to just pick up one of the threads that we put down towards the end and meditate on that for a minute. And that is that it's very tempting, especially for those of us who are kind of high info Christians, which Lord of Spirits listeners, that might be you. It's very tempting for those of us that are high info, you know, and I'm not saying that makes us knowledgeable. It's just high info, like lots of info. It's not a good thing, it's not a bad thing in and of itself. It's tempting for us to think that Christianity consists in getting all the information correct. You know, line it all up correctly, get it all correct. And especially with Orthodox Christianity, where there's so many details to look at it as, like, which is the poison M and M in the jar. You get this one thing wrong and it's all bad. You kill your salvation, whatever it might be. It's very tempting to think that way. And especially for those of us who are high and folk Christians, and particularly those who came into the Orthodox Church of our own volition a little bit later in life, not having been raised in it, to think that that is what consists in being an Orthodox Christian. Like, that's what it means to be Orthodox, to get all these things right, get all the rules, rules right, get all the theology right, get the dogma lined up. I mean, I see. I mean, we've mentioned this before, but I mean, I see endless, endless, it seems, battles on Twitter, or, I'm sorry, X formerly known as Twitter, that's how we have to call it now, that whole phrase, or on Facebook or on social media in general, about very, very specific philosophical questions about Christology or about all kinds of stuff. And by no means am I saying that that stuff doesn't matter. I'm not saying it doesn't matter, but. But the context in which those conversations are happening is not a context in which the outcome of those conversations is actually being applied pastorally to people who are trying to live their Christian lives. It's not. It's not. Admit it, it's not. The context is people who want to be right. And there's nothing wrong with wanting to understand that stuff and get it right. There's nothing wrong with that. Right. The reality is that most people throughout history who have been Christians, to be traditional, to be a traditional orthodox Christian, is not about lining up all the details of tradition and getting them correct. It's not for most of them, and I would say for the ones who actually made it, for sure, we know made it for sure and are saved that we know them so for sure that they're saved, that we call them saints and we put them in our church services and make icons of them. Right? The saints. Being traditional means being obedient within the context of the community that God has placed you right. It means doing the things on the ground that actually are Helpful to other people, crucifying your own will, sacrificing your own preferences, putting other people first, right? And I'm not saying that to just like throw out a kind of like I've actually had people say this. It's just moralism. By no means, by no means at all, right? But the point is that those of us who are high info, we often think that because we have high info, then that means that we are qualified to make the determinations about what constitute acceptable variation or unacceptable variation. And the truth is that most of us are not qualified. Most of us do not have the authority to do that. And no, vox populi, vox DEI is not a Christian doctrine. It's not. Just because lots of people say something does not mean that that is the voice of God speaking. Lots of people have often said a lot of horrible things all at the same time. There are videos of the people doing this. The reason why we give this outline of this arc of Christian history and of what we would regard as probably normally as pre Christian history, but as we've tried to insist is actually still one religion, the worship of the one true God throughout all of human history is not so that we can take it in hand and say, aha, I have the skeleton key to work all this out and I can apply it to other people. It's rather actually God willing to deflate some of the inflation that exists, the tension that exists for people and to realize, look, actually the point is to follow God with what it is that you've been given. That is the point. And to realize that it is not any of our place to throw condemnation, frankly at people who are in, as we said, part of heretical bodies. We're not saying they're not a heretical body, right? Like I saw for instance an orthodox priest talking about a body that, you know, I would regard as having certain heretical beliefs. And he talked about that they were living in utter darkness. In utter darkness, right? Like I'm thinking, like, well, number one, who exactly is going to be converted by that kind of language? Maybe, I don't know, maybe somebody likes to be shocked into it or whatever. I don't know. I'm sure they're out there. But it's also simply not true. It's not utter darkness. Things that people get right, they get right. You can't say it's all darkness because they got this one thing wrong. It's not all darkness. Faithfulness is faithfulness. Remember the Ninevites, demon worshiping pagans who repented God honored their repentance. He held them up as examples against people who had all the correct info. Remember that? Remember the Ninevites, Everything that's good comes from God. There is nothing good that comes from some other source. Nothing. Nothing at all. So as we consider this big ark, I think that it's important to bring it always back to that point of, okay, what am I going to do with this? What has God given me to do with this? And how can I use this information that I've received now in a way that is actually going to be for my salvation, for the salvation of other people? Like, actually not just interesting, fun stuff that I can get right now, but on the ground, you know, where we actually are saved. Love one another and love God above all. So, Father, what do you have to say? What do you have to say for yourself? Father Steven DeYoung well, making your way."}

If you think you might want to get married and have kids, you got to figure that out. You got to find a person to do that with and try and find the right person you're going to be able to do that with over a lot of years. And how do you figure that out and how do you know and what do I do? And you got to figure out, well, what do I want to do for a living? What will actually pay for me to be able to live? Am I going to have to cobble together 2, 3, 4 things to try and just survive, right, and live, let alone have some kind of quote unquote career that leads to a retirement or something, and how am I going to qualify myself? Where and how can I get education and how much debt should I take on to do it? It's on and on and on and on and on for US religion, including for Christians, Christianity has ended up getting treated very much the same way. It's one more thing you got to figure out now, kind of fortunately, you may have a default setting on that still. If you're a person who was raised religious, you were probably brought up in some particular Christian or other religious community and you could always default to that. You can sort of just keep doing that and take that one thing off the table. But that's not what happens that much anymore when you look at the actual landscape of things. First of all, a lot of people aren't brought up with any religion, so they don't have a default. But even those who are frequently, for various reasons, become dissatisfied with that situation. And then either way, you're out into the world trying to figure that out too. And it's very much framed by our culture, the way our culture frames everything in this consumeristic way where, okay, I mean, I go, I figure out what I think is right and what I believe based on right books that I find convincing and preaching on the Internet or TV or wherever that I find convincing of certain ideas. And then once I kind of settle on what I think is probably right and what I like and what I think it should be like, then I try to find a church that matches that. And guess what? There never is one. So I try to figure out like, well, okay, this, this place has this and that place has that. Well, I guess I'll go to this one because, you know, it's got most of the things and the things it doesn't have I can live with, at least for now."}

You find out something you didn't know before you change your mind. And all of this is just this kind of chaos induced anxiety where this burden is being heaped on people as individuals, meaning separated from their communities, their families. No, this is, you have to figure this out for yourself. It's all dropped on people. It's all dropped on people at an age when they're not prepared to do any of it. But I think some of the callers we had tonight and what we talked about tonight have a lot to do with an antidote for that or at least another way of approaching that. There is a way of being in the world, there is a way of life, there is a way of worshiping the true God that has existed for as long as humanity has existed. Not identical, but fundamentally the same. And There are various other ways of being in the world that have sort of fallen away from that over the years. Whether they fell away from it very early on, whether they fell away from it in the Neolithic Revolution, it fell into paganism. Whether they fell away from it at a later period into some kind of religious thing of their own devising by artificially shoving things together, or they fell away from it by following some heretical idea that distorted that true faith, that true way of being in the world, a true way of worshiping God. But there are all these ways that have fallen away from."}

We need to approach. If you accept that that is true, even if you don't accept necessarily that, as I or Father Andrew would say, that that is preserved in the Orthodox Church, even if you don't accept that Orthodox Church part, if you accept that that is true, then it behooves you not to try to figure all these things out for yourself. Guess what? You don't have to. It's your lucky day. This is one thing you don't have to do that with, but rather to find the place that practices that way of life. Father Andrew and I believe that is the Orthodox Church that has preserved that. But, you know, to find it, to find the place where that is and then to place yourself within it, and then this will be one thing in your life that you don't have to be in charge of, that you don't have to struggle with, that. You don't have to yank the reins on or turn the steering wheel. This will be a place where you can learn and you could be shaped and you could be formed and you could be transformed and you could be healed and you can be helped. And as that process happens, the really good news is that process and doing that process within a community of other people who you'll be bonded with as that same transformation and that same thing is happening with them, will also help you a whole lot with all those other things you have to figure out. It won't do all the work for you, but it'll go a long way and it'll help an awful lot with all those other things. So next time we're going to kind of pick up where we sort of left off. After the second half, we're going to talk about modernism and some other things. But for now, we need to work on reorienting. Is religion something I feel figure out and then do as I think best?
