And he will be the light of the nations and the hope of those whose hearts are troubled. All who dwell on the earth will fall down and worship him. And they will praise and bless and celebrate with song the lord of spirits. First Enoch, chapter 48, verses 4 through 5. The modern world doesn't acknowledge, but is nevertheless haunted by spirits, angels, demons and saints. In our time, many yearn to break free of the prison of a flat secular materialism, to see and to know reality as it truly is. What is this spiritual reality like? How do we engage with it? Well, how do we permeate everyday life with spiritual presence? Orthodox Christian priests Father Andrew Stephen Damick and Fr. Stephen DeYoung host this live call in show focused on enchantment in creation, the the union of the seen and unseen as made by God and experienced by mankind throughout history. Welcome to the Lord of Spirits."}

And we've talked about. What we mean by that is we've talked about how contrary to say, 19th century worldviews, where they thought and previous where they thought that animals were just sort of mechanistic machines that didn't have feelings or emotions or consciousness, we now know for certain that they do. I mean, anyone who's had a pet. Well, most pets. Some pets, sure. You know, but you got a pet iguana or something, you know, or you're the snake guy. Maybe not. But if you've had, you know, traditional animals, you know that they have some level of consciousness. Either a fun, loving, warm consciousness like a dog, or a hateful Spiteful, evil consciousness, like a cat. But they have, they have some level of consciousness. So there are levels of consciousness sort of below human consciousness. Right. There are ideas and concepts and things that humans can comprehend that they can't. Right. But consciousness is not just 0 or 1. Right. And so when we're talking about spirits, we're talking about levels of consciousness that are above the human level."}

And we've talked about this in terms of your own body. Your own human body is a composite of organs and organ systems and bacteria that are actually separate life forms and all kinds of other things, sort of subsystems that operate according to their own regulation and therefore have some, in some cases, very low level of consciousness. Yet it's not like you sit and argue with your spleen, you know, or you tell, you have to tell your heart to work. Right. That human consciousness is itself in a way, not really a gestalt consciousness, but a higher order. The sense that it encompasses those lower level consciousnesses in our organs and the organisms that make our bodies function biologically.

Yeah, yeah. But so what, right? What is a demon? So, of course, originally, we're talking about the word demon in Greek, which technically means something like an ancestral spirit. The way that term is used is closely related to the way that Theos. Right. That we translate as God, with either a lowercase or a capital G, the way it's used, in fact, there's overlap, right? There's overlap. There's not. There's not always a super clear distinction between the two. Sometimes those terms are used for the same being, and it's distinguished based on activity and that kind of thing. On the whole, in general, generally, there's tons of exceptions to this, but in general, daemon is used to refer to a lower level. If someone is using both the term theos or thei, the plural, we'll talk about gods and then also talking about daemonis. Right. Demons, as we would transliterate it. The daemonis is referring to a lower level of beings than the beings that they're referring to as the. As gods."}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #110 - 2025-02-13 - Who is Your Demon and What Does He Do -","start":1088.4,"end":1202.72,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Right. And what's going on there is not. It's not purely that the words were interchangeable, it's that there's a memory there of a couple things. One being that, you know, Zeus has like three birthplaces. So there are actual ancient Greek kings who were sort of assimilated into Zeus. Right. Into this thunder God. So there's this memory of him being this ancestral spirit. Right. Having been this sort of ancient king at some point in the distant, murky ancestral past. But then also there's the memory of, Remember, there's the Titans, including his father Cronus or Kronos, and then there are the Olympians, who are the children of the Titans. And so in that relationship, Right, the Titans would be the higher order or the more ancient or. Right. The greater level of spirits and the Olympians would be the lesser. So there's a connection there too. So when you find Zeus or Apollo being referred to as demonis, it's usually in some context where that memory is at issue somehow or is in the background. So that means that in. In purely Greek contexts. Right. In pagan Greek contexts, there was not a negative. There's not a sense of opprobrium attached to that word. Right. When you say demon to someone now, they instantly think evil."}

A negative thing. It becomes a negative thing in a Christian context. The term doesn't get used a lot in Greek second temple Jewish writings. It does sometimes once you get to the Greek period, not just like people writing in Greek, but post Alexander the Great, you start getting it used to refer to what or otherwise referred to as, for example, unclean spirits more commonly. But it's really in the Christian context. So for example, when St. Paul says, what the nations sacrifice, they sacrifice to Demons and not to God. Right, to demones and not to God, singular."}

We do not to the God of Israel. We're not sacrificing to the God of Israel. We're sacrificing to devotees. Right. So it's kind of an incontrovertible point. Right. And so because of that distinction. Right. Because with the spread of Christianity, the worship of daemonis becomes a thing opposed to the worship of the true God, the capital G, God. Then daemonis takes on this negative character. Right. And that's why we now think of it in that. In that way. Right. And in fact, this causes a lot of confusion if you start trying to look into the Jewish understanding of what we would call demons. Because as we've talked about on the show before, the Anakin tradition and the stuff about fallen angels gets repudiated very early during the period of the formation of Christianity, such that already by the time you get to St. Justin's dialogue with Trypho, Trypho is saying, you know, you goofy Christians think that angels rebelled against God. Right. Because. And it is true that now Orthodox yuzhi is that there are no angels who rebelled against God. So the beings that we would consider demons, even the unclean spirits and this kind of thing are not considered to be spirits in rebellion against God in a Jewish context. They're just considered to be angel, the same as angels. They're just spirits like angels are. They all do God's bidding. Just some of God's bidding is unpleasant from our perspective. And so there's a very different. Right. But that develops out of. We've talked about this in the context of the Old Testament. They're not getting that out of nowhere. Right, right. We've talked about the sort of Old Testament theodicy that these demonic powers, these spiritual powers of evil that are at work in the world, God sort of has them on a leash and makes them do his bidding. Right. And so the current Jewish view develops out of that. If you take that and you strip away the Anakin tradition and the way in which those traditions find their way into the New Testament, that's what you're left with. Right. So that's the reason for that disagreement. But they still don't have that understanding of sort of spirits that have rebelled against God that's been sort of. They sort of excised those Anakin ideas from their tradition. And it's fair to say excised, because there are some cases where Orthodox Judaism is just continuing. The sect of the Pharisees. Right. The Pharisees obviously had their own particular beliefs. And so there are some things that the Pharisees sort of never really thought fully accepted. There are other things that a 1st century Pharisee would have been comfortable with. See, for example, St. Paul, that a third century Orthodox Jew would have become much more uncomfortable with."}

I mean, even in Dante's Inferno, he's imprisoned there. Right. Like this whole idea that he rules there and he's sort of this almost romantic, you know, political revolutionary or something. That's all Miltonian nonsense. Right. You can enjoy his prose, you can enjoy his. I'm not big on English lit, but feel free to enjoy as fiction. Feel free to enjoy it as fiction. It is fiction, but it is fiction. There's no connection to the Bible. Even though a lot of people grew up, even people who grew up in churches who say everything they teach is based on the Bible being taught that even though it's nowhere in the Bible. So we talked about how these angelic rebellions are things that are connected, that begin after the creation of the world. We could give the St. Andrew of Crete quote again in his commentary on the book of Revelation, when he's talking about Revelation chapter 12 and the fall of the devil, he says we must accept, as all the fathers teach, that after the creation of the world, the devil fell through envy. The church fathers have various days, various creation days to which they link the creation of the angels, mostly the first day and the fourth day, though there's a minority report for the second day. But the idea being that the angelic creation happens as part of the creation of the world. And the beginning of angelic rebellion with the devil begins in Genesis 3. Right? Right. And it's connected that rebellion. We're going to deal with this some more, both in tonight's episode and in our follow up episode two weeks from now, that because of that, these angelic rebellions, again, we don't know what it's like to be an angel. Don't know what it's like to be a bat. You don't know what it's like to be an angel. So we don't know how angels experience time since they don't have bodies, they don't age. Right. They don't have material bodies like ours. At least they don't age. Right. They don't experience materiality in the same way they don't experience flux of change. So how they experience time, we don't know. Right?"}

The point here, though, being for tonight, all of those angelic beings from all of those four or five episodes that it says those are all things that get called demons. Right. So the devil is referred to as a Demon. The prince of demons. Right. This kind of thing. The other demons who fall. Right. Who are referred to by as the watchers, the angels who left their former estate in the time of Noah. Right. From the New Testament, those are referred to as demons.

We talk about saint not being the opposite of sinner, but saint being the opposite of demon. Right. And we'll talk more about the saint side of that in a couple of weeks here. But so, as we just alluded to, right. There's a distinction. And St. John Chrysostom was making it in his own day, in the fifth century between sort of popular ghost ideas and demons. Right.

They're not stupid lunatics, right?

I think, you know, the stuff that I'm familiar with that's on the medieval side of things, the way that it sometimes gets played out.

It's very likely if someone did something horrible to themselves or others, for example, that there were demonic spirits involved in that person getting to that point. Right.

It's easy to say they're mysteries that we have to take on faith or on the authority of tradition, but that is not how the early Christians understood them. To them and to all ancient people, the idea that physical objects had spiritual power was very intuitive, whereas modern people tend to find this difficult, bizarre or even unchristian. This is because we live in an era shaped by secularism, a way of viewing a world that's incompatible with sacramental thinking. Because secular ideas are at the heart of our culture, modern people tend to think in secular ways without realizing it, even the most well meaning of us. How then do we live in but not be of a secular culture? We need to understand the enchanted sacramental way that the early Christians viewed the world, but we also need to understand secularism. What is it really? Where did it come from and how does it influence how we think about religion? Journey to Reality Sacramental Life in a Secular Age breaks down these important issues in accessible, non academic language and is an ideal introduction for for young readers, catechumens and seekers, as well as for any Orthodox Christians who want to deepen their understanding of the sacraments."}

I'm in North County. I'm on the. In San Diego county, on the north edge of the proper boundaries of the city of San Diego. But just for simplicity. Yes. So I wanted to follow up on Father Stevens characterization of the resurrection of the body and how one way to think about it was that it was reconstituting our relationships. And so what really sparks my interest there is when the Sadducees challenge Jesus about the resurrection and they bring an example of marriage. And marriage is really tied up with relationships and everything. And they challenge Jesus on that. He tells them, oh, you err for, you know, everything else he says. And he says they'll be like the angels in heaven. And I think a lot of people take that, take that versus just as a negative sense. Oh, angels aren't married. But I don't know if that's really even maybe what Jesus means. I think there's a positive meaning there. Maybe. I think I'm thinking of a psalm where righteousness and peace have kissed each other. It feels like that the virtues and that maybe that the principalities there, they have a deeper communion that's maybe closer to maybe kind of the end goal of marriage in the first place. So I don't know. I just wanted to. Wanted to comment on how Father Stephen's characterization of the resurrection of the body relates to what Jesus teaches there."}

But I don't think that's what Jesus means because he went from saying, you know, they're not married and given in marriage, but are like the angels, you know, so, so it wouldn't, it would. It wouldn't make sense to say they're not married and given marriage, but they're actually like this other kind of marriage instead, you know? No, it's like the angels is that the life of the age to come is not like this life. It's quite different."}

And I started noticing knocks and box and things like that. And my landlord son lived there and had lived there for years and I, you know, we became friends because we're both kind of techie and gaming, we love gaming and tech. And I was just expressing to him the things I noticed and he said, oh yeah, there was a guy that died here and he was dead for days, maybe a week or more before they were, he was found. And I thought, okay. And he said, yeah, I noticed the same kind of things. It's just part of what goes on here. And I'm thinking, huh, you know, maybe this is proof of God, maybe this proof of a spiritual life. And again, keep in mind, this is like just me meandering between faiths and oh gosh, I was thinking if I could prove this in the spiritual world, then I got a reason to believe in God, right? So there's, there's the draw to me. And so I start calling out this thing and you know, if you exist, show me yourself, prove you exist. And I'm doing all of this like in ignorance of anything, just not knowing, just knowing that like I want proof of the afterlife. All this culminates in one night. I'm laying in bed and I had a window with a street light outside. So there was some slight light that came through and it was always kind of, I could always see the room. And I'm laying there and I get this chill and I look up and the entire room goes pitch black. Like there was no light, there was nothing coming through the window. There was nothing. And then this image, I saw it like inches from my face. And I don't know how to explain it except it was a demon. And I started praying harder than I've ever prayed and it profoundly altered my view of what I was doing, right. And after I started praying I never, never ever again challenged it, never ever again asked it show itself. And I didn't see that again. But what I saw was the most insidious face I've ever seen in my life. I have never been more scared. And I do know that psychologically there is the fulfillment of self prophecies or whatever they call it where you know, you think something's going to happen and happens. And so I'm not sure if this was something that was like self made or something that actually saw. And that's the question I have. What do you think?"}

I mean I would, I would say to me, right, like the point of experiences like that if God permits it, whether it's some kind of psychological experience or, you know, contact with a demonic spirit or whatever, the point of all of that is repentance. Like, the point is to come away from that. Either convert, you know, converting, returning to God, you know, increasing your faithfulness, whatever it might be. Right. Like, the question is, what you do with it? Not so much what was it? It's, what do I do with this? Right. I don't know, Father, what do you think?"}

I was re listening to those episodes and one kind of major monster group, at least in my head that was excluded, were ghouls.

So I was wondering, like, is this kind of, you know, another reflection of like what a nephilim is? Is this some kind of demon? Like, what's going on?"}

Actually, fun fact, ghoul is from Arabic, so it doesn't appear in English until 18th century. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. So, but I mean, so the concept within Arabic folklore, fairy tales, whatever is these are. Yeah, as you said, they're, they're, they hang out in graveyards, they eat human flesh. So you've got that kind of cannibalistic imagery. So I mean, yeah, it's participating in the same kind of continuum as, you know, you mentioned the Greek vampire, the vrikolakas. That's one you can try on at parties, you know, tell people. So have you heard of the vrikolakas? And then they'll have, they won't have heard of it unless they're Greek and then they'll probably know more about it than you. You know, it's the same kind of thing as that as, you know, giants. You know, there's actually, there's an old English word or which is where the word orc comes from. And that's again, it's sort of flesh eating or corpse eating idea in Latin. There's the orcus, which is actually where the old English Orkneys comes from. Again, sort of flesh eating. Although it's fun. Like, the Latin orcas is even also, like, another name for the Hellmouth, but you can see how that would be related, you know."}

We talked about how spirits, including demons, existed. The world of thoughts. Right. T H O U G H T S thank you. If you know, you know the. The what. Ed what. What that means. Right. So we're going to get a little more into what that means. And this is going to be pulling from some other old episodes that you may or may not have listened to and may or may not remember and try and pull some things together. And so what are we talking about when we're talking about the world of thoughts and thoughts in general? Right. As we've talked about, thoughts are not. We tend to, as contemporary people think about the mind as the brain, like the organ, the brain. And since it's in our skull, we think about it as sort of like a computer in a box. Right. And it sort of generates thoughts in there. And we have this. Most of us, not everyone. This is fascinating to me, but I've never actually met one of these people. But there are people who do not have an inner monologue. Yeah, but I mean, a lot of people, this isn't like a 1% thing. This is like a 20% thing of people. But, you know, we have this idea that we're sort of generating thoughts in this box. And, and so you'll see questions like, in Christian circles, can demons or can the devil, can they hear your thoughts or read your thoughts? And of course, within fiction, science fiction in particular, and superhero fiction, like telepathy, being able to read other people's thoughts and it's, you know, that means you can read the little balloon over their head, right? What they're thinking to themselves. Right."}

Right. The fact that we think brain right off the bat. Right. Should tip you off that this isn't how they thought about thoughts. That's. And so if we think a little more. If we think a little. Phenomenologically. We've said this before on the show. We don't really have the experience of generating a thought in the sense that if you write a sentence, if I'm sitting in front of my computer and I type out a sentence, or if I'm sitting with a piece of paper and a pen. I know, Gen Alpha, you don't know what I'm talking about. And I'm going to write a sentence. I have to formulate the sentence. I think about what word I'm going to use next.

Right. So the mind perceives a thought. Right. A thought comes in through the mind and we have then a point of attention that could be directed. We can direct our attention to a particular thought and dwell on it, connect it to other thoughts and ideas. We can try to expel a thought. We try to focus on something else because we don't like the thought that's presenting itself or the experience that's presenting itself. But the thoughts show up. Right. And this is why you'll see the Fathers referring to the noose as the eyes of the heart or the eyes of the soul. Right. Because that's the comparison that. It's like your eye. Right. But with thoughts. Now, as Father Andrew said, we need to disambiguate here between a thought and an idea. Okay. Between a thought and an idea. Because sometimes people, when they're trying to understand what we mean by this, will say, well, no, I have had the experience of generating a thought. And then what they describe to us is putting together an idea. Right, right. Using thoughts to construct an idea. Okay, so we're going to disambiguate what the difference is here between thoughts and ideas."}

The color, the shape, all of that is accurate. It's coming in our eyes, Right. But we don't know what it is. Right. So that's like thoughts, ideas are like when we resolve, when we focus in on it and say, oh, right, that's, you know, another dog toy that my dogs have torn up. That's why that's a misshapen blob. Now, right leg over there on the floor, right? That's an idea, right? Now that idea could be wrong. I might be wrong about what that is over there on the floor.

And the ideas we resolve them into are things that are useful for us. So, for example, when I've identified what I think the thing is, oh, well, it's just that now I don't have to worry about it.

Or I've lost something, I'm trying to find it, and then I see it, there it is. Right? But the idea is like another level of abstraction from reality that could be wrong. And that's because when we go from just a thought to an idea, when we go from just visual data to an image to resolving an image, our own subjectivity enters into it."}

It might look like something they've seen before, but not be that same thing. Right? Because that's.

It might be easier to exterminate all of the poor people than to lift them out of poverty by providing them with opportunity. Right. That doesn't make it good. The good option, because we understand morality. That's an evil thing to do. Right? So there could be good and evil ideas, but that's because these ideas are constructed, right? So when it comes to thoughts, right. We can't control what thoughts enter our brain any more than when you open your eyes. You can control what you see in front of you. Right. Someone can hold up something obscene in front of you and you're going to see it whether you want to or not. Right. You could make the mistake of opening that message I send you and seeing the meme and being horrified. Right? And you can't unsee it now. Right. But you don't get to choose. Right.

That you didn't want to enter your head and you desperately want to get out of your head. That didn't come from you, that came in from outside, just like something you see. But what we can control is what thoughts we allow to form ideas and what ideas we allow those thoughts to form, and then after that, what ideas we choose to act on. So we've used the metaphor before on the show, and this is us trying to be more concrete about it. The metaphor on the show of thoughts being like seeds and you control which ones you allow to take root and grow. That taking root and grow is forming into ideas. Yeah, right. And what ideas, right. They are, they are allowed to form so thoughts can be accepted and rejected. You could have a thought and not allow it to become an idea. You can reject a thought. Yeah, right.

But then even the thoughts that come in and that we allow to form ideas, the thoughts that we then think about, that we dwell on, right. We have control of what kind of ideas those produce. Right. For example, you meet a person, right? From whatever impressions you get spiritually and materially, from what they say, from how they present themselves, how they talk, you get the impression this is a bad person. Right. This is not a good person. That's the impression you have. That's the thought that comes into your head. Right. You can formulate that thought into different ideas. Right? Ideas like, I should pray for this person. Right. I should try to help this person. I need to talk to this person about what they're doing because they don't realize how harmful it is. Right? Or right. It could be. This is a bad person. Right. This person should be canceled. This person should be shunned. I should verbally abuse this person. I should cut this person off. I should go and warn everyone and talk about in detail what a bad person this is. Right. All those different ideas can come from the same thoughts, right. And the same impressions. And some of those are good, and some of those are bad, and some of those are evil. And we have control over that because at that point, we're at this sort of processing phase. Right? And so the.

I do have just a couple question about like Bashan because I've, you know, I'm familiar with the Bible, you know, kind of reading it, you know, before going to Orthodoxy as a Protestant. And I know like it says in the Bible, like there's all kinds of symbology there, like Dan jumping out of Bastion, you know, like, you know, when it's like in the prophecy of the patriarchs to the quote to the 12 sons of Israel, there's also OG, you know, being the king of Bashan, you know. And recently, you know, I noticed that that's related in Syria to, you know, the Golan Heights area, which is, you know, which also has a lot of historical connotations. So I'm kind of wondering what the symbology of that is. And just a couple another question maybe in, you know, more related to the podcast. So in regards to like that question is like, I know it's like I'm kind of starting to think about icons kind of like at the same time they kind of maybe reflect something spiritually of ourselves. So like, you know, someone, you know, sometimes like we grow up with certain preconceptions. Like for example, you know, there might be like, for example, like a certain false masculinity which is incompatible like with gentleness, for example. So when you go to an icon, if you have trouble, you know, kissing the icon, sometimes I'm wondering if that is that actually an evil spirit in that case. And just a third question, like, you know, just kind of like to kind of put in there going a little bit more mystically like the five wounds of Christ on the cross, is that, are those related to the five books of Moses? And is the four gospels, is that associated with the Tetra magnogram, like YHWH you know, in the Old Testament, that would be my questions."}

So Bashan was the place of residence of a giant clan, of which Og was the chieftain or the king. Bashan was also later a center for BAAL worship. It's where Mount Hermon is."}

Haram. It's the cursed mountain, essentially, because it's covered with pagan shrines. The ancient pagan shrines are still there on it. Right. You can go see them everywhere on it. And so it was a center for BAAL worship later. And so it was sort of the. The. The homeland of sort of spiritual evil in the north. It represents it. A lot of prophetic literature. My favorite reference to it actually is the women of the Northern kingdom of Israel being referred to as the sleek cows of Bashan."}

Just keep listening to the rest of this half. And then you asked a question about numerological symbolism, like five wounds of Christ. What was it? I'm trying to remember now, the connections that you made. Yeah. Five wounds of Christ with what was the five things that you were comparing it to?"}

And then Tetragrammaton and the four Gospels. I mean, all of those things have been used by the Church fathers. They'll connect that stuff.

But it's not like there's some sort of secret code that's unlocked by saying, oh, here's a number four, and here's another number four. You know, that's."}

Like, if I was studying something in another language before I went to sleep, I would be, like, speaking Hebrew or Greek or something in my sleep, but you would think I was possessed. But the most famous one of these.

Not long after my grandfather passed. Within a few weeks, I was awoken one night by a dark figure in my house.

And the dark figure sort of went away into the corner. But as I approached the church and I learned more about the intermittent state or the intermediate state, I. I sometimes wonder if that might have been him visiting me or. Or in some sense. I should mention that in those days, I would often listen to scripture on a tape at night.

Embrace that experience as a good and positive thing. Don't become proud about it or arrogant, but spiritually arrogant, but accept it as a good thing. If what that produces in you is fear or unsettling or something else that has the opposite effect that disturbs your Christian life, then reject it as demonic. Right.

Demonic possession. What do demons do? Right. As usual, we get to our actual topic in the third half. So the first place where we really see.

We've talked about that in another episode that obviously involves things we would call demons. But the kind of demonic activity that we're talking about now.

Now, this is not this. A lot of people have a real problem just with what I said already. Right. God sending an unclean spirit. God sending a demon on Saul.

This is related to what St. Paul says when he's talking about excommunicating someone as sort of the final step of church discipline to call them. He refers to that as handing them over to Satan. Yeah, Right. Like this is the idea. The idea is. Well, at a certain point, you cut them off of things in the hope that they will repent and come back once they see how bad it is to be sort of on the outside. Right. And so Saul's put on the outside, but rather than that leading him to repentance leads him to anger, rage, murderous rage against David, resentment, everything but repentance. Right. When we get to the Book of Tobit, we get to a case that of demonic activity that's starting to look more like what we see in the New Testament. So Tobit, probably there are a lot of folks who are listeners, who are Protestant friends or who are from a Protestant background who may not have read Tobit."}

I mean, it's at least a great piece of Second Temple literature. Right. Even if you object to full canonicity or what have you. But so in Tobit, So because people haven't read it, we're going to frame this a little more. So in Tobit, there's this problem presented where Tobit son is going to marry this woman, Sarah Problem being there's this demon, Asmodeus."}

And so, as we've talked about in the marriage episode, marriage proper was basically the consummation of the marriage. That's when you were married. That's when you moved from betrothed to Mary. So it was consummated. And every time one of these seven men had tried to come in and consummate the marriage, Asmodeus had killed them."}

There are a couple of problems. One problem is that Tobin has been struck blind. The other problem is dealing with Asmodeus. And St. Raphael tells them to catch a certain fish and prepare it in a certain way, do certain things with it, burn certain parts of it as an offering, and then that will take care of the blindness issue and take care of Asmodeus. A lot of people have problems with this part because they're like, what is this weird? Why is he, you know, this archangel giving voodoo recipe? Right. To do this? And, you know, so this is one of those things. So certain of our Protestant friends who are really opposed to seeing a book like Tobit as being part of the Old Testament, they will do this thing where they go through it and they try to find everything that they think is ridiculous. So, like this. Like this fish thing and say, oh, look, that's ridiculous. This can't be part of the Bible. Okay. But I could go on YouTube right now and find some atheist saying, oh, look, Balaam's donkey talks to him. That's ridiculous."}

Right. Ezekiel running around the city naked. Ezekiel seeing all this weird stuff in the sky. Clearly he's taking lsd. Right. They say all the same stuff right? Now, our Protestant friends who make the argument about Tobit will be quick to rush to defend the scriptures they view as canonical against those accusations when an atheist makes them. But then they make the exact same accusations on the same basis. Right. Using the same standard of believability about books that they think should be excluded. That's not weighing with even scales. Right. Let's think about this fish thing for a minute. Do not the prophets in the Old Testament and angels who come to visit people in the New Testament, give them signs with material things or assign them things to do. Like why did Naaman the leper have to go dip himself in the Jordan seven times to be healed?"}

But just saying, oh, that's, this is the same kind of stuff you find in the canonical scriptures. Right? So there's not really a difference there. Also, by the way, Tobit was originally written in Hebrew. It was not originally written in Greek. We know, because we have Hebrew and Aramaic fragments of it in the Dead Sea Scrolls from Kumra. So that's just a fact. Right? It was translated into Greek. But anyway, I digress slightly. So Tobit does the stuff he's supposed to do with the fish he could see, right. And his son Zalebar Sarah, because Asmodeus gets banished when he gets sort of exorcised, he gets sent back to Egypt and Saint Raphael imprisons him in Egypt. I know these seem like random details, okay. But we're going to get, we're going to do a little, little mini deep dive here, a shallow dive, a mid range dive right here about Asmodeus. And some of these little details in Tobit are going to be important or are going to connect to other things. So Asmodeus, this is one that we haven't talked about before. We've had some episodes where we talked about different names for the devil, right. And devil figures in Second Temple literature and in the Bible, like Belial and Azazel and Satan and the devil and Beelzebub, right? We've gone through a bunch of those. We did run on the Antichrist, but we haven't talked about Asmodeus. So this is, this is some different stuff."}

It's a, it's a transliteration of Persian. Pretty much everyone agrees, right? 100% of scholars never agree about anything. There's always a minority report, right? There's always someone trying to overturn the consensus, but just about Everybody agrees that it is a transliteration of Aishmadeva in Persian becomes Asmodeus in Greek, which literally means in Persian, wrath demon. Right. Demon of wrath. And so the idea here is that this demon and this demon coming upon someone is a manifestation of God's wrath. So something sinful has happened. This demon manifests itself. Right. So this is kind of similar to what's going on with King Saul, right?"}

Tobit is not part of the Hebrew Canada of the Old Testament, but it has a long afterlife in Judaism and through Judaism and Islam. In Islam, Asmodeus is a devil figure and is the king of the demons in certain Islamic literature. But this comes by way of the Talmud. And so there are these various references to Asmodeus sort of littered around in the Talmud that reflect sort of these different earlier traditions, these bits and pieces. And some of these are also reflected in, of all people, St. Gregory the Dialogist, or St. Gregory the Great, the Bishop of Rome at the end of the 6th century, reflects some of these traditions. So in the Talmud, Asmodeus is connected with Solomon's wives in a couple of different ways through a couple of different traditions. One of those traditions, he impersonates Solomon potentially to sleep with his wives. And, you know, there are other things going on with Solomon. We'll get a little more into that here in a minute. And he's also presented at one point as being married to Lilith. So you roll on back to a previous Halloween episode about LILITH Also."}

And then when you get into medieval Judaism, you find a more developed bit of traditional that Asmodeus is actually the disembodied spirit of David's Nephilim. Right."}

So moving from Old Testament, of course, the place where we most see exorcisms in the Bible is in the Synoptic Gospels and Acts. There are no exorcisms in the Gospel of John, but in the Synoptic Gospels, in Acts, there are a lot of them. We've talked before on the show about the connection between Jesus as the Messiah and this because of particular Psalms of David that were used in the first century, we know from Qumran and other places were used for exorcisms. So David was this figure associated with exorcism, Son of David, the Messiah, similarly. And so part of the reason why the Synoptic Gospels are presenting Jesus performing exorcisms is connected to his messianic identity as the Son of David. But also we see that this is demonstrated and described as an authority over unclean spirits, an authority over demons that Jesus possesses and which he then is able to give to his disciples and apostles."}

But most importantly, both in the case of Christ and his disciples and apostles, the authority manifests itself as they cast out demons with an authoritative command. Right. And the demons have to obey it because it's Jesus authority. It's Christ's authority. Right. That's sort of the important element there. And we see there is a distinction, though. Again, this is something which Jesus, his divine identity inherently possesses. Right. And is able to give the disciples, but the disciples receive it from Jesus.

Yeah, I, I, well, you know, like I said, a number of you in the, the chat on YouTube were asking about exorcism, and we kind of finished up there. And yes, I mean, number one are liturgical acts of exorcism that a priest or bishop performs for. As he said, with baptisms, in some special cases, if someone is evidencing, evincing demonic possession, but also house blessings, like, this is the time of year a lot of people are getting their houses blessed. So, so all of that is there, these priestly acts. But I also wanted to kind of extend that out a little bit because I know that here, my sense is that right now there's a lot of people who are worried about demonic activity and maybe experiencing it in a way that they haven't in the past, or perceiving it in a way that they haven't in the past, sometimes because they or someone they know was quite deliberately involving themselves in it, like in the occult or witchcraft or, you know, whatever it might be, fortune telling mediums, you know, etc. And you might ask like, well, okay, all right, yes, I need to connect with a priest and you know, and have to be baptized or to have my house blessed or whatever is needed. But then also, just because that happens, right, that doesn't mean that all the temptations are going to go away. It doesn't mean that all of your bad habits are going to go away. It doesn't mean that experiences that you have of maybe even being tormented by spiritual attacks are going to go away. So the question is, well, how do I live now? What do I do? I think this is one of the big questions of our moment in history that we are at what am I supposed to do? And the good news is that there's not some kind of special formula or technique or method. What you're supposed to do is to live the Christian life like be baptized, become part of the church, live in repentance, live in faithfulness. All of the things that are the normal Christian life. Worship together with other believers, prayer together with your family at home, prayer privately, reading the scriptures, participating in the fasts, engaging in almsgiving and acts of active love and charity. These are the, this is, this is the Christian life, right? These things. And the beautiful thing, one of the beautiful things about this, as you live this way, as you put your life in order, as you put your, your house in order, you put, you know, your family in order, all these things, these are all exorcistic acts. All of these things are exorcistic, meaning that they drive out demonic influence. Because there's no neutrality. There's no neutrality. The way that you drive out demonic influence, the way you drive out synergizing with devils, is by synergizing with God, doing his works, participating in what he wills. And that elevates the human person, it heals the human person, right? That's how it works. That doesn't mean there's not going to be temptations. I mean, even we can see with very, very holy people, super holy people, very advanced, they can still be attacked by demons, but the outcome is going to Be very different than someone who's saying, okay, well, let's do that, that bad thing, the evil thing. So that's what I want to leave folks with, is that the normal, everyday, ordinary acts of Christian life are actually electrified with spiritual power because Christ said that he would give us grace and save us through our faithfulness. So what do you have to say, Father Stephen?"}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #110 - 2025-02-13 - Who is Your Demon and What Does He Do -","start":10449.73,"end":10715.68,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"So, yeah, related to that, there's this statement Christ makes about exorcisms where he talks about how if you exorcise a demon, the demon goes into these very dry places, right? Out of the desert, you cast out into the desert, out into the wilderness, out into the place of evil, right? But if there's not any kind of change in the person, then it just comes back and moves in with seven of its friends, right? And the person's worse off than they were before. And I think we've maybe taken what Christ is saying there too literally, as in, we've said, well, I haven't literally had any demons cast out of me, so this verse doesn't apply to me. This is kind of an obscurantist thing. But what Christ is actually talking about is something. Because, remember, demonic influence is this spectrum, right? He's really talking about something that we've all experienced, and that's that a lot of this stuff keeps coming back, right? I could pretty confidently say that there's probably no one listening to this who's an Orthodox Christian or probably a Roman Catholic either. Who, meaning they go to confession. Who hasn't had to go back and confess the same things over and over and over again? And you don't want them to come back. That's one of the reasons you're bringing them up in confession. You don't, right? You don't want them to come back. You want them to be gone. You want to be done with this for good. You want to never do this again and fall into it again. And it comes back. And sometimes it gets worse. And at the core, as hard as it is for us to hear, the core reason that keeps happening is that while we don't want it to come back, we don't want to do the work that would be required for it not to come back. We want the results without the effort. We want confession to sort of be magic. There, I said it. I said it out loud that I did this. I don't want to do it anymore. Now I want to never be tempted again, right? Now. I never want to have to think about this again. Now I never want to have to worry about this again. Are we able to just go through life blissfully peaceful, never, never falling back into sin? But that requires hard work, right? Because all of these things that we've fallen prey to, all of these places where to whatever degree might be a small degree, might be a larger degree, we've given these powers, we've given our enemies. You have enemies, if you don't have any visible ones, you have invisible ones who are out to throw stumbling blocks in our path, who are out to trip us up, who are out to destroy us ultimately, right? Every little bit of turf in our life, every little piece where we've given them some control and a foothold and a finger hold, right? All of those places, even if. Even if the power of God comes in and uproots it, Christ has warned us, if we don't then make the changes we need to make, if we don't then fix the things we need to fix, they're just going to come right back and maybe worse, right? And these changes we need to make in our life, right, We've got a life that's full of all kinds of things. Some of those things are sinful and bad. Part of the problem is we try to replace those with nothing. I say to people in confession a lot, right? If you try to avoid this sin that you're struggling with by sitting in your room and staring at a wall, that ain't gonna work."}

If the temptation you face requires you to go off by yourself and spend time alone, then one of the best things you can replace that with is just spending time with other people, spending time with family members, spending time with friends, out with them in public, right? Spending time in real space with humans, going to church activities, going to other things, right? Thereby removing you from that situation in which you are tempted and filling your life with something good, even though it's common, it's still good even if you're not.

The levers they used to pull, right. Unfortunately for us, our enemies are really crafty and they'll find other ways and we'll have to repeat this process and we'll have to keep doing it.
