And he will be the light of the nations and the hope of those whose hearts are troubled. All who dwell on the earth will fall down and worship him. And they will praise and bless and celebrate with song the lord of spirits. First Enoch, chapter 48, verses 4 through 5. The modern world doesn't acknowledge but is nevertheless haunted by spirits and angels, demons and saints. In our time, many yearn to break free of the prison of a flat secular materialism, to see and to know reality as it truly is. What is this spiritual reality like? How do we engage with it?

It's referring to gods of the nations, the gods of some particular nation, the household gods of an idolater. There are places, but it's the same word. There are also places where that term is used to refer to angels. Both fallen and unfallen are just referred to as gods. A lot of these are hidden in English translations because people get squeamish about them because. And we won't go back all through this again. As we talked about, the category of monotheism is a late one, but then once it came around, you know, we can't say gods to refer to angels because that makes it sound like we're polytheists. So we translate it. They'll change it in English translation to angels or spirits or something else.

This is common. Yeah. So in the past, we have recommended for people who don't want massive amounts of student debt, like I have to learn ancient languages, but who want to do serious Bible study to get the Net Bible with the full notes, because they have, of course, extensive notes on these kinds of things.

The expression is traditionally rendered cool of the day because the Hebrew word ruach can mean wind, yu cassuto. So this is obviously one of the scholars concludes after lengthy discussion that the expression refers to the afternoon when it became hot and the sun was beginning to decline. JJ Niehaus offers a different interpretation of the phrase relating yom, usually understood as day, to an Akkadian cognate, umu, which means storm, and translate the phrase in the wind of the storm. If Nihaus is correct, then God is not pictured as taking an afternoon stroll through the orchard, but as coming in a powerful windstorm to confront the man and woman with their rebellion. In this case, the phrase kol yuvah, the sound of the Lord may refer to God's thunderous roar, which typically accompanies his appearance in the stor. Do battle or render judgment.

And we're going to be Talking about English, the English word ghost. Ghost. It's a great word in English, and we tend to use it these days to refer to something we're about to talk about later. But traditionally, ghost refers to spirits. Right? Just. It's the general word for spirit. It actually has a kind of a different origin from these other words we've been talking about from Hebrew, Greek and Latin, where the idea of wind and breathing and spirit are all kind of connected together. In English, it does not have that same origin. Father Stephen asked me, is ghost related to gust? And I am sorry to say they are not related. They are not cognates. They do sound a little similar, it's true. But this is what we call a false friend. False friend. It'll betray you in the end, everybody."}

In English, we've also, you know, we've got, for instance, the. The German word geist, which is essentially the same ghost in English, comes ultimately from a proto West Germanic word, geist, G, A, I, S, T. Geist, which comes from a proto Germanic geistaz, which ultimately comes from a proto Indo European root that I'm not going to try to pronounce, but that protohypigo Sanskrit, man. I know, I know. It's like. I don't know. Yeah, I'm not. Yeah, sorry. And that one actually ultimately comes from a word that refers to anger or agitation, which it kind of makes you wonder, like, well, how did we get from that to the sense of spirit? And it's. The overlapping concept is fear or terror. Right. So the idea that when you encounter a spirit, this is what you feel. And so that's how we get the modern English word ghost. Interestingly, you know, we mentioned gust. Right, Gust. Actually, it comes from a root that refers to pouring. So gust and gush, for instance, are cognate with each other and have this idea of a pouring out. So gust is a sudden pouring out of wind. But, yeah, alas, they are not connected together. But, yeah, ghost does have a cognate in Sanskrit that refers to anger or hatred, and one even in Persian that refers to something that's ugly, hateful, or disgusting. But generally in Germanic languages, it's all spirit. It just means spirits. But there is not this sense of breath or wind in the English versions. Fun, though, especially if you read stuff that's early Modern English. And in Middle English, you'll see the word ghostly and used exactly to mean the way we would use the word spiritual. So a Very ghostly person does not mean someone that haunts your house and, you know, Casper the friendly ghost kind of thing, but rather a ghostly person is a very spiritual person and you could even refer to having your ghostly father. So I'm just going to suggest to everybody listening at home right now that next time you contact your father confessor that you refer to him as your ghostly father and just sort of see what happens. I'm just throwing that out there for everybody."}

They not only believed that they came into existence at some point.

And now he is. And now his son came and overthrew him. And so even in. Right. The disagreement between, for example, the Old Testament texts and pagan polytheism from the surrounding nations is not that they said their gods were eternal or even that their most high God was eternal. And Israel said, no, it's Yahweh. It's that both had this layer of spiritual or divine beings that came into existence. And then in Israel there is this other beyond being. Right.

I love Sunday school and youth ministry, but I think we all know that faith is formed in the home. Orthodoxy is not a collection of ideas you can teach in class or hand off in a program. It's not a list of theological propositions. Orthodoxy is a way of life. It's a way of seeing the world. It's living your life for Christ every day. And that's what we need to pass on to our children. Our holy tradition offers us so many treasures, but sometimes there's so much that we don't quite know where to begin. We read books about wonderful monastics praying in caves. We read about saints giving up their lives. But how do you pray in a busy house full of kids? And more importantly, how do you teach the kids to pray, to fast, to love Christ and to chase after Him. That's why Caleb Shoemaker and I wrote the book Blueprints for the Little Church. It's for anyone, young or old, newly converted or born Orthodox, who wants to establish beautiful Orthodox rhythms in their home. The Church offers us so many ways to set our lives and our hearts to the beat of holy Orthodoxy. We want to help families find that rhythm living and growing with the tools that God has given his church. You'll find blueprints for the little church at the Ancient Faith Store and wherever you buy books, or if you prefer, check out our ebook and audiobook. And if your family would love a weekly podcast where you can learn about the faith together, join me and Christina Wenger on Tending the Garden of Our Hearts, a podcast for the whole family on Ancient Faith Radio."}

That it's just an observable sort of phenomenon. It's not that there's some personal being actually doing that. You know that, like, the spirit of the age is just a metaphor. Right.

They just sort of solve that. And the reason why, I think that was in some ways a turning point in awareness of this was there was this idea that lots more education equals a more moral world.

But this is this understanding of the visible church as the material body. And the Holy Spirit is the animating Spirit of that body, is what we mean by that. So the history of the Church is the history of this organism body of Christ. It's ultimately the history of the life of Christ in the world. But the Holy Spirit is the Spirit who's animating that body. And so this is what we're talking about when we talk about tradition, right?

Because we have this right, Personal, active understanding of the Holy Spirit and of tradition. And that allows us. Right. As you know, St. Paul is talking to the church in Corinth at the level of this individual Christian community in the city of Corinth, about in the dead center of the first century A.D. right? And Corinth was about in the center of Greece at the time. And so he's, when he talks to them about the diversity of gifts and the diversity of the members, he's talking about literally that what we would call a parish community, that there were different people there with different gifts, right. Who were part of the body in different ways. But this is true on the macro scale too, in both time and space. This is why the Orthodox Church has always allowed for diversity in a whole lot of things, from language to some of the details of liturgical ritual performance, to not just the language, but even the text and what books are in the Scriptures. Right. That all of these things are not only allowed for, but they can be seen to be a good thing in that all of these are expressions of this life. And all of these different things that are accepted and are part of the life and tradition of the Church are all part of that diversity of organs within the organism that allow the whole organism to function and be what it is."}

The animating will and energy of the Church is. Is the Holy Spirit. You can't put the Spirit into a spreadsheet or a box. And by that, I don't mean that anything goes. Right. Because there are different spirits that are trying to animate us. The question is to be in the Holy Spirit, to be in Christ. I think that's one of the problems is that there's this modernist assumption that unless you're willing to put things into boxes and you have to pick the right box, that you're saying that anything goes. But that's simply not true. We see how the Holy Spirit is consistent through the ages. For instance, there is a diversity, but it's a diversity within and animated by the one Holy Spirit."}

All right, well, some final closing thoughts. One of the things that happens a lot these days is people look at evil happening in the world, especially when we look at it happening on massive scale. But it doesn't just have to be in 2022. We mentioned some other evil happening earlier, just in the 20th century, but I mean, this is human history, but we know about the evil happening now. One of the things, the questions that people often ask is how could people do that? How could it come to this? I don't understand. Right. And as modern Western people, I think most people listening to this, probably that describes them, maybe not everybody, but modern Western people, it's hard for us to understand this because we tend to be individualists. And so when we ask how could it come to this? How could people do that? How could this great evil have happened? All we can conceive of is individual people making individual decisions. And why would someone ever choose that? We can't get inside their head. Why would they ever do that? And why would all these people ever follow a person who leads them into evil? Right? But if we look with the eyes of the Christian tradition, the eyes of the scriptures, the eyes of faithfulness, then we see that there are spirits animating whole peoples, individual people, of course, that they do have a spirit about them. And when we recognize that, then it makes sense how you get these, these phenomena of whole peoples doing evil things, but also how you can sometimes, thanks be to God, have whole peoples who do good things. Right. Renewal does occur. The great renewal is still, from our point of view in the future with the resurrection and the end of the age. But there are lesser renewals that can come. And that is why, as Christians, we always are people of hope. And it's not because we think well enough people are going to get their minds changed, and so eventually we'll collectively have something better. That's not what it's about. Rather, it is that the spirit of God moves, that the holy ones who are obedient to him move, and there is a renewal that occurs centered in the people of God and that that can benefit the whole world. Right. Even the people who are not part of the church as yet. And so we see renewals once in a while, and we should be hopeful because we know that when we conform to that, then there is this animating character that we ourselves become conformed to. If we're individualists, we kind of don't like that idea, like, don't make me do anything. But the reality is that even if we try to be utter individualists and we try to resist the Holy Spirit, then we are actually not being truly individualists. We are simply conforming to another spirit. Or as we like to say on this podcast, sometimes there is no neutral ground. You're either following the Spirit of God and being enlivened by him and being conformed to his will and energy, or you're being conformed to the will and energy of a dark spirit. There's no middle ground. It's just not a possibility. And that's because as humans, we are permeable. We are always being animated. There's no way around it. So we have to choose. We have to choose to cooperate with the Spirit of God if we're going to come like him, if we're going to be like Christ, if we're going to receive eternal salvation. Well, there's a lot of things that's profoundly hopeful about that. But the one thing that I want to zero in on that's profoundly hopeful about that is that if we can lay aside our individualism, then we can choose to align our wills with God. But we also realize that the victory does not depend on any one of us or even a collection of us. We don't have to get enough votes in order for the world to be saved. That's not how this works. It is an act, truly, of God. And so then the question is, will I be on board with that or will I not? And to me, lifting that responsibility off of ourselves is profoundly hopeful and freeing because it means that there is a force, a good force, not the force, but there is a good spirit at work in this world. There is a good spirit at work in this world which is above and beyond all other spirits. He is the Lord of spirits. Right. So, yeah, this is kind of a tough episode in some ways to really, you know, a little bit, a little bit of mind bending. It's been a while since we did one of those, but I think it's good for us. And I believe also that we, having learned some of this, then Our ability to read the Scriptures is enriched and deepened. Like especially take a look at First Corinthians, Chapter 12, you know, where St. Paul talks about the body of Christ, but at the beginning of the chapter, he's talking about the Spirit. Fancy that, right? He begins talking about the Spirit and he talks about how they're been led away from idolatry and they now are in the Spirit of God, and the Spirit of God gives gifts and the Spirit of God makes us the body of Christ. So, yeah, check out First Corinthians 12, having listened to everything that we just said, and I think you're going to read it in a very different way, and I hope a very beautiful and hopeful and frankly encouraging kind of way. So, Father."}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #053 - 2022-10-13 - What's a Spirit When It's at Home -","start":9487.15,"end":10078.62,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"So if you, for example, go on Goodreads and write a 2000 word screed about one of my books about how I'm the evilest man who has ever lived, rest assured I will read it and enjoy it thoroughly. But one, one thing I notice as I go out trying to find criticism of myself, one thing I've seen sometimes about Lord of Spirits in particular is that we have some folks who will say they like the show, but that essentially Father Andrew and I are too sectarian, that we, you know, we, we present information, we present things that they want to hear and are eager to hear and that are helpful to them, but that we place that within this grid of orthodoxy that they don't accept or don't want to accept or aren't interested in. And so they wish that we would just sort of give them the information in a way that they could fit it into their current grid, right? Their current paradigm, their current understanding from some other Christian group or some other group in general, or just their own personal views. And we're not going to do that. But the reason for that is that quote I started out with, we're not here to take the temperature, we're here to change the thermostat. Because one of the things that has most greatly hindered our church life and our lives and influence as Christians in the modern world, and this isn't. It hasn't hindered God, right? But it's hindered us, right, is we have a set of self imposed limits that we don't even realize are self imposed limits because we've inherited this whole framework for understanding the world and understanding human activity and understanding the way the world works and politics works and religion works and history works. That's all based around principles that are fundamentally not Christian, that are based in sort of hyper individualism, that are based in materialism, that are based in a secularism, that concretely means that religion is purely a set of ideas and it's disassociated from or disassociate a bull, at least from everything else. We've inherited all this. And by holding to this, we sort of limit our own horizon and limit our own possibilities. We limit what can happen in our parishes, in our families, in our own lives, in our communities, our civic life, in the life of the countries we live in, in the life of the world. We put these limits. This is what we can do. Again, God isn't limited by them. And so what I at least hope to do with this show, and I've always hoped to do with this show, is not just feed a little more information into that hopper, not just sort of expand the paradigm a little with some new thoughts, right? Not just sort of adjust the thermostat that's already there, but to try to bring a completely new way that isn't really new. It's new to us, right? But not new. Like to paraphrase St. John in First John, new and not new at the same time. A new to us whole paradigm for understanding who we are, what the world is, how it works, what's in it, how it relates to each other. And then based on that, a new understanding of ethics, a new understanding of politics, a new understanding of history, a new understanding of all of that, which again, isn't really new. It's always been there, but maybe now new to us. And so that means we can't just tinker with the dials, we can't just rearrange the furniture a little bit, we can't just slap a new coat of paint, right? We have to overturn everything and start over again, right? To paraphrase Nietzsche, we have to reevaluate all our values. We have to look at all the things we've thought were most precious and most important and say, how important are they really? Really? And what is really important, right? How are we to live? What does it mean to be a Christian? What are we to be doing in the world? And when we're willing to do that. When we're willing to do that, it's not easy, right? I'm still doing it. Everybody's still doing it. Who's even trying to do it is still in progress. But when we do that, the first effect it has is that those limitations disappear. The limitations we put on ourselves disappear. The things we think in a wild dream and then say, oh, come on, right? Those things all of a sudden become thinkable, impossible, and even doable because we are no longer limiting ourselves to. Well, I'm never going to be able to convince enough people to go along with this. Or, you know, there's. There's just not enough money for this or that kind of thing doesn't happen anymore. I believe it used to happen back in the church. You know, I'm not denying that the saints did this or that or that this or that happened, but it doesn't happen anymore. It doesn't happen to me for sure. Doesn't happen in our parish, doesn't happen in our city, right? All of those limitations sort of disappear. Because the Holy Spirit is God, meaning he can do anything. He can do anything he wills. And that means that we can do anything, as St. Paul tells us, when what we're doing is cooperating with that will. Your parish can be transformed, your family can be transformed, your city can be transformed. Any country on this planet can be transformed. This whole planet can be transformed. And it doesn't require you winning an argument. Coming up with a brilliant idea doesn't require any of that. It just requires each of us for ourselves, to cooperate with God and with what he is doing in the world. And then things start to transform and they start to happen for us, Right? For us. And great and wonderful and amazing things can happen. So when, even in this episode, and I know I do this a lot, when I say, sorry, Calvinists, or I say, sorry, somebody else took a shot at James White earlier this episode. When I do that, I'm really not doing that out of a kind of chauvinism or out of a team spirit for the Orthodox Church. You know, my dad could beat up your dad, right? I'm doing that because the kind of transformation that needs to happen isn't going to be possible for me. I'll speak for myself under those other paradigms and ways of thinking. And we're saying that here's how you should understand spirits. Not as just this exotic and interesting thing. Ooh, I'm into this weird stuff, right? But because this understanding is going to open things up for people, we hope, right? I may be wrong about some of it, but we hope is going to open things up for people. It's going to make things possible for people that they didn't see as possible before because they didn't see them as possible before. For them, they weren't. That's always the goal. The goal is to try to set you free from some of the shackles that the spirit of the age has put on all of us. And so hopefully that's what we're doing. And so, yes, I will be kind of a radical sometimes, right. In calling for these things. And if you're able to listen to the show as someone who's not orthodox and who disagrees with, say, half of what I say, and you're able to find things that are individual, things that are helpful for you, God bless you. Right? You do you. Okay. But that's never going to be like our goal. That's never going to be what we set out to do. What we're going to set out to do is to try to change everything and liberate everyone, which sounds crazy except for the fact that we're hoping that we're doing this in tandem with the Holy Spirit, who's God himself."}

And I beheld and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beasts and the elders, and the number of them was 10,000 times 10,000 and thousands of thousands, saying with a loud voice, worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and Blessing. Revelation, chapter 5, verses 11 through 12."}
