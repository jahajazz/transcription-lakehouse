And if you're listening to us live, you can call in at 855-AF-RADIO. That's 855-237-2346. Matus Ka Trudy will be taking your calls tonight, which is what we are doing all this episode. So welcome to our first episode of 2022. We're doing an open line night answering your wackiest, hardest, most abstruse questions. Do you think your uncle is one of the Nephilim? Are Reptilians running your local post office? Do you want to make a pitch for why unicorns really aren't monsters? This is your chance. Call in at 855-AF-RADIO. That's 855237. Before we start taking calls, I just want to mention something really fun that I found out about recently and that is that there is this idea that ancient Egyptians worshiped onions. Have you heard of this, Father Stephen?"}

And I ran across this because someone asked the question, like, why does St. John Chrysostom say that Egyptians live in fear and dread of onions? And I was like, well, that. I'm sure he said that. And so I looked it up and sure enough, there's two different places that he mentions Egyptians and onions. And one of them where he talks about them living in fear and dread of them. The other one where he actually refers to onions being God. According to the Egyptians. And then there's actually also references in the Roman pagan writers Juvenile and Pliny, who. Who mentioned Egyptians worshiping onions. It turns out that onions are depicted all over the pyramids. And it shows up in Egyptian mummification practices that onions were actually placed in the eye sockets of some of the pharaohs. Yes."}

Now, I could not find. And maybe you can add something to this. So I get to ask the first question. I guess maybe I could not find actual references to them worshiping onions. But it does seem to be the case that they were doing something ritually with onions. And certainly the Romans seemed to think that they were worshiping onions. Were they offering sacrifices to onions or just, you know, of onions?"}

And, I mean, he's often depicted as being a giant as well. Right. So there's this kind of othering element that goes along with this. I mean, I've seen it, and I'm sure Father Stephen, you have more to say about this, but I've seen it described as, well, he was just really ugly, but I'm pretty sure it kind of goes beyond that. Right. So I don't know. I think that there is a suggestion of that. Right. That he may have been involved in that kind of thing in some level. Obviously, we're talking about before his. His sanctity and so forth, but I don't know. Father, have you looked into the St. Christopher with the. The canine head stuff?"}

So, yeah, so there's a play going on there between the fact that Rome, of course, was built on seven hills, the city of Rome, and St. John is very deliberately positing the present day for him Roman Empire as the current embodiment of Leviathan. So there's very much a direct connection there because we talked about how, you know, the monstrous depiction. Right. Is to convey certain things about Leviathan, but this is a spiritual being in a spiritual entity. Right. And so it is a spiritual entity that animates. That animates not just individuals, but also collectively people and empires and cities. And so St. John is very much trying to communicate that the sort of embodiment of Leviathan at that time was the Roman Empire. So this is why Revelation both is and isn't about Rome. It is about Rome, but it's not just about Rome."}

Maybe you guys can come up with something. But you had mentioned that in the Gospel of John that he's using These two terms, filio and agape, in the conversation with the Lord. And that that was really. That those words were likely just being used interchangeably. And I was hoping that you could expound on that, on where. Where do you get the information that causes you to come to that conclusion?"}

I mean, there's a lot of. There's a lot of sermons that have been preached on the idea that there's something different going on. You know, Peter, do you love me? Peter, do you love me? Peter, do you love me? And then, you know, underneath the Greek is a little bit different. And even you've got. And, you know, I say this with all respect for one of my favorite authors, you've got C.S. lewis's the Four Loves, where he, you know, uses that same kind of idea. Right. So the problem is this. And this is how I understand it, you know, actually me, if necessary. Father Stephen. The problem is that those two words are used synonymously in a lot of other places, including in the rest of the corpus of the evangelist John. Right. So if you're going to say that he intends them to be taken in different ways, then you would need to show that that is his usage or show from something contextually that that's indicating that. Right. And part of the problem is, of course, that, you know, it goes the opposite. Like, it goes the opposite direction in other places in his works. I'm trying to remember a particular example. Like, there's one where it's where, you know, if you take it, that Philia is just sort of like brotherly friendly love, that that would make no sense within the context. Can you think, am I remembering that correctly, Father Stephen, or something like that?"}

I mean, yeah, you're on the right track. So a lot of people have been taught. I don't think this happens as much in Orthodox circles, but it may. But a lot of people have been taught to sort of use this concordance mode of Bible study where you go and follow a particular word in Hebrew or Greek and sort of follow it through the Bible and you find all the places it's used and you do kind of a word study and say, okay, here's what this word means, and then you plug that into all the places where it occurs. Right. And that's not a normal way to read anything. Right. Like, you would never do that with something other than the Bible. Like, you would pick up my books or Father Andrew's books and say, what are all the ways that Father Andrew uses the word green in his published books and blog Posts. Okay, so here's what Father Andrew means every time he says the word green and then go through and plug it in it. Like you'd never do that, right? But a lot of people have been taught to do that with the Bible. And what that assumes is that a given word just has this universal meaning attached to it, right? Which is sort of bad linguistic theory. So words derive their meaning from usage. And there's lots of examples of this where there's a word that used to mean one thing and now means another, right? Like in the same language."}

So one example of that that we've talked about in the show is when you look across St. Paul's letters, when he talk, uses the word dead, right? The noun dead without an article, right? He means just dead people. When he refers to the dead with the article, he's referring to deceased Christians, right? And the way we discover that is we look at all the places where he uses it with and without the article, and we see if there's a pattern, right? And then if we see a pattern, we say, hey, St. Paul is totally consistent about this, right? Every time, right? Then we see, okay, there's a pattern. So these mean two different things. He's using this as a technical term to make a distinction, right? So you. You could. If you're. If you're gonna say, well, I think in John 21 that he's switching between Filio and Iapi to make a distinction, right? The way we. We decide if that's true is we go and look at. And we could just take the Gospel. We just take the rest of the gospel of St. John, right? And we say, how does he use. How does he use those words throughout his Gospel? And is there a pattern? Right? And what you find when you go through and look at how he uses the word is, for example, when Christ says to his disciples before his death, the Father himself loves you. The verb he uses is filial."}

I've heard this, and I've heard them do that. Preaching on a text that does not at all say what they're saying. It says there's some other text that says that that they should have used. Right. But. And so I'm not trying to take away the good points that CS Lewis or anyone else made by doing this. I'm just trying to clarify that one. But, yeah, the other objection we got was about. It says at the end that St. Peter was grieved because the third time he asked him, do you love me? And some people point at that and say, oh, well, see, and in English, it does read like that. The third time he asked him this, that's what grieved him. But the way Greek syntax works is with Greek, in English, you tell what part of speech a word is and how it's functioning in a sentence by the word order. Right. So our sentences are almost always. Unless it's a question like subject, verb, direct object. Right. And then whatever else complicates it. Right. But in Greek, the form of the word tells you, so you could put it in any order you want. And so the words get ordered in order to convey certain meaning. And so if St. John had wanted to point to the difference in verb in that sentence, he would have phrased it in Greek that St. Peter was. That Peter was grieved because the third time, do you love me? He asked him. The asked would have been at the end, so that the grieving, he was grieved because of what was asked. And that's not how it's phrased. It's phrased he was grieved because he asked him the third time. And then is the quote of what."}

So my question is about the order and hierarchy of demons. I've heard that demons are chaotic and disorderly and often fight each other, but from my understanding, they also all share one common goal, which is to torment and destroy as many humans as they possibly can. So why then do they fight amongst each other? And if they don't, do they have any sort of hierarchy or allegiance with each other? Do they collaborate? I understand demons are deceitful, so they probably try to hide their works and nature from us as much as possible. But is there anything we do know about this?"}

Where there's this accusation made against Christ, you know, that he's casting out demons by Beelzebub, and he makes the comment, you know, how can I be working for Beelzebub? Can a house divided against itself stand? You know, which suggests that they're working sort of together. So here's my take on this, and it's my understanding that, on the one hand, there are not, like, ranks of them the way that you see angels laid out in terms of specific roles. Right. There's not this kind of order the way that, you know, like, for instance, the Saint Denisius lays it out, or even the kind of list that St. Paul uses, you know, when he talks about the. The unseen powers and stuff. And. And so. So. So there's that. But on the other hand, as you said, you know, they do have this common goal, which is they want to drag us into hell with them. Right. Yeah. And. And certainly there are places in scripture and in other related literature that talk about certain demons being, like, a chief or a leader among them, you know, which could mean a couple of things. Like, it could mean some level of cooperation, but it could also just mean, okay, this is a really big one, you know?"}

And those things can be related, you know, but, but, but, yeah. I mean, I do think. I mean, I think part of your conclusion that. That they're liars is. Is one of the. One of the problems with this. Right. You know, like, there's not, like, ranks of. Of hellions all lining up and obeying orders from a captain and, you know. You know. Yeah.

Right. The reason that there are ranks of angels is that we're talking about degrees and varieties of participants, participation in the divine energies, in the works of God. Right. That's what puts them in their order. And that's the language that's used for that, is sort of how close they are to his throne. But of course, that's analogical language. Right. Because his throne isn't like a physical chair. Right. But that's an analogy. Right. That's the degree to which they're participating in God's works, in his creation. So demons, by definition, are not doing that. Right?"}

Right. But we also have to remember that. I mean, we don't know proportions. But I'll just go ahead and say most of the things we're calling demons were vast cosmic intelligences. Right. So they're not, like, dumb. Right? They're not. And so, you know, for example, I know we've mentioned this, but they're. They're perfectly capable of playing the long game, for example. Right. Like, they can do a lot more damage and destruction playing a long game over time with a culture and perpetuating evil within that culture than just throwing into things into abject chaos and murder.

I was curious about the spiritual realities of marriage. Two becoming one flesh. I've heard that my entire life, but I don't really know what that means on a spiritual level."}

And then, Father Stephen, I'm going to bump the other one over to you, although I do know some things about that. So. Yeah, what does it mean that the two become one flesh? Obviously, that should not be taken in an utterly literal fashion, except for in the sense that it should. I mean, there is a literal one fleshness that occurs, right. And that's where, you know, marriage is. Is oriented towards child rearing, towards, you know, you know, the creation of children, right, by God through the couple. So there's that, but also there is, you know, there should be this growing intimacy over time, right? You know, I've been married now for, oh, boy, 18 and a half years or not, which means that I'm not an expert at marriage, but I am now at the stage in my marriage where I realize I'm not an expert. And the thing that I often like to tell people, right. You know, I served in pastoral ministry for 13 years, and the thing that I would often tell people, especially, you know, within the first year or two, typically, there are problems that start to arise, right? You know, and people will come to their pastor and will say, you know, father, we're fighting all the time. And I mean, this is terrible and whatever. And I actually knew one priest who had a couple come to him with exactly that. And he said, oh, this is wonderful. And the response was, what? And he said, oh, well, the whole point of marriage is to reveal your sins so that you can repent of them. So it's working, which is totally true. And the purpose of marriage, from the point of view of the church, besides being for the procreation and raising of children, is so that the husband and wife can help each other to the kingdom of heaven. And some of the way that we do that is that we're a mirror to each other for the other sins. I learned all kinds of things about how sinful I am by being married to my wife and all kinds of opportunities to repent, Right? And so that's what's going on. And the growing together and intimacy comes as a result of both people repenting before God and working on that together, Right? And so, you know, often people will say, you know, well, we've. We've. We've started having problems or whatever, you know, and they'll look at their wedding pictures and say, oh, we were so happy on the day what went wrong. And I'll. I'll say, look, okay, you know, on the day that you got married, you did not have a good marriage. You had a wedding, and it was a great wedding, but you did not have a good marriage because you are totally new at this, and you have no idea what you're doing. You know, you're brand new. This is day one. Why would you think you're good at this on day one? Right. It's the beginning of something. You're learning a skill. Marriage is a skill, Right? So, you know, that's what it means, that the spiritual element of becoming one flesh, you know, it's about two people working on their repentance together. Right? So that's the key there. And before I kick the rest over to Father Stephen, I want to at least say this as a framing thing, at least for the way that I think about this question of, you know, will we be married in heaven? Is that even in the modern period, there are different opinions about this. Like, I know that Father John Meyendorf, for instance, taught this. And so from him, it became a lot of people within the American Orthodox context learned that from him. And so they repeat it. But then there's others that will say, no, that's not what that means. Right. The way that that position reconciles itself with Matthew 22, that section of Matthew 22 is to say that when Christ says, in the resurrection, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven. They take it to mean that there's not going to be any weddings in heaven, Right? Not that there won't be Marriage in heaven. That's the way that they kind of work that out. But that's not the only position on this. So now, having said that, I will kick it over to Father Stephen."}

So the. We have to. In answering this question, we have to kind of think a little deeper. I think we need. We need to think about what we mean by marriage, right? So when that question gets asked to Christ, okay, what's going on is the. These. These are Sadducees asking him who don't believe in the Resurrection, right? So this is being asked, not in good faith, this is being asked as a gotcha question, right? And the way they phrase it is whose wife will she be? Because all had her. So it's who. Whose possession will she be? Right? Which of them will. Will have her as their possession in. In the kingdom, Right? So Christ's response is sort of immediately responding to that, Right. But expanding beyond that. Right? So what are the ways in which we think about and talk about marriage and then how would or could they apply in the life of the world to come? Right? So again, we're not talking about heaven, we're talking about the world after Christ returns. This is going to become important in a minute. So one way we think about marriage is sort of this exclusivity, right, that this person has this intimate relationship, and particularly a physically intimate relationship only with this one other person, right? And no one else, right? Well, if in the world to come, we're not reproducing, right? And that. That's not a factor. And so we're not talking about physical relations aimed at reproduction of the species. Then that factor kind of drops out. It's just pointless, right? You know, to say, well, who is this woman gonna be having children with? Well, nobody's gonna be having children. You know, what woman is this man gonna be making children with? Well, nobody, right? But on the other hand, and I think this is my best reading of Meyendorf, which seems obvious if you think about it, right? When we talk about marriage, a lot of the time, if we think about a couple that's been married for 60 years, they got married in their 20s, and now they're in their 80s, they've been married for 60 years, and we talk about their marriage, what are we talking about? We're Usually not talking about physical exclusivity, because at that point, there's not a lot of that physical element. Right. At least the part that would be exclusive family show. Right. And where what we're talking about is an emotional intimacy, a spiritual intimacy that They've developed over 60 years of shared experiences and love. Right. So if someone is going to say marriage doesn't exist in heaven, are they saying, so in the world to come, when they're raised from the dead in eternal life, all that they've shared together is going to go poof. Is going to vanish. They're going to forget each other. They're going to forget that love. They're going to forget their children and their grandchildren and the love they have. I mean, obviously not. Right. Those are the things from this world that are going to last forever. Right. So that marriage, if that's what we're talking about, is that intimacy and that love that they share, that's going to become eternal, that's going to exist in the life of the world to come. And we have to be careful here. The reason I said I'm stressing life of the world to come is that there's a lot of Gnosticism that wiggles its way in here, especially when addressing this question, because it's a short step from marriage isn't going to exist. Given the way I just mentioned, we tend to talk about marriage to. We're not going to be embodied."}

The Problem of Violence in the Old Testament, written and read by Stephen DeYoung. The God who reveals himself in Scripture may at times seem to conflict with what seems right to us, but the ways of man lead to destruction. By sojourning through this tension, our views of ourselves, our lives, God and his creation are reshaped and reformed in a way that is truly real. Wrestling with Christ as he appears to us in the Bible will yield his blessing only if we allow ourselves to be molded and taught. We cannot approach the Scriptures to find our own personal Jesus who conforms to who we may want or even demand that he be. Such a Jesus probably does not exist and so will avail us nothing.

I've started paying attention to the culture more broadly speaking, and I've been noticing trends, like stuff like my truth has been come, become the most prevailing kind of, you know, idea out there, and it's kind of spread like wildfire. And even the leading theory on basically how the universe has been created when we're speaking materialistically, is from some quantum vacuum that's unlimited potential, full of energy and chaotic. And you can never even pin it down until there's an observer. So it seems like the world's kind of in this very chaotic realm where there's no overarching truth anymore. And I guess if I can pretty much simplify this, I'm wondering if there's any way that this has happened in the history, if there's something that can reconcile this from, like, a orthodox point of view. My wife and I are about eight months into the Orthodox church. We're official catechumens. And, yeah, we've been enjoying the journey and found a lot of peace and clarity.

But though they didn't theorize about it, I mean, this has happened throughout human history, just more non reflectively, right? I mean, the Assyrians, when they went out and cut a bloody swath across the ancient Near near east, conquering and destroying cities, were basically imposing their story and their order and their version of the truth on the world through violence, right? They, they didn't have Nietzsche sitting there describing it, right. Or, or Foucault theorizing about it, but they, they did it right? And the Romans did it right? They made a desolation and called it peace, as Livy says. So this kind of thing has been happening. And so, I mean, you see this in a great place to go is early Christianity. We already talked about the Roman Empire in the book of Revelation, right? But Caesar had a truth, right, about himself, about Rome, about the gods, about culture, about how society was structured, right? He had a truth about humanity, that humanity comes in gradations. And so slavery is perfectly wonderful because there are some people who are just born unfit to be free. They're fit only to be slaves. There are peasants who are lower than that, right? And then the people at the top of the society are there because they're just a better sort of people. And the emperor is such a great person that he's pretty much a God, right? And so he had this truth that he was conveying. And one of the first things that Christianity does, if you look at it from the perspective of ideology, is say no, that is not what's true. This is what's true. That is not what humanity is. This is what humanity is. That is not what God is. This is who God is. That is not how the world and society should be structured. This is how it should be structured. And the pattern of God's rule over the cosmos. And so Christians have really been in the same position all the way through Christian history. It's just in a lot of eras, which are the eras that we might be tempted to look at as the good eras, actually aren't the good eras, because those are the places where we started to take it for granted and the places where we haven't been resisting the world are not the places where the world has been in pretty good shape. It's just been the places where we've stopped resisting. Right. So there should always be. Right. St. Peter tells us this. Christians should never be at home in any nation, in any time, in any place until Christ returns. Then we'll be at home in the world to come. Until then, we should not be at home until then. There should be this disjunction between what the world says is true and what we know is true."}

You know what I would add to that is I know that the word relativism is used a lot to describe our current situation, but I've never met an actual real relativist. Right. Everyone believes that certain things are true, even if it's just something like, please don't hit me, right? No one thinks that that is good. So everyone deep down believes in some kind of truth. And usually it's actually not just one little thing. Usually there's a whole arrangement of what truth they believe in. Right. And one of the things that Father just said was talking about the narratives and stories that were being told as you go, and he mentions the Assyrians, for instance, saying this is what's actually true. Right. And I think that that is one of the most important ways to understand our current moment. And is that, you know, part of it is because living in the information age, we are bombarded with stories of various kinds that contradict each other all the time, possibly at a, at a, at a high that humanity has maybe never really seen before. Right. Like, I'll give you a good example. So I used to. I used to actually run a Facebook group dedicated to my town. And I ran it for, actually for about 10 years until I was just like, done with it. And as these things tend to go. But you know, whenever someone would post about some minor crime happening, right? Which, I mean, crime is always bad, right? But like, you know, a kid's bike getting stolen or a car getting broken into or whatever. Almost always then people would respond with like, oh, man, what is our town coming to? It used to be so wonderful, and now all this crime is happening everywhere. And I actually knew some of the local police, and I talked with one of them, and I said, hey, people are talking about this kind of thing all the time. I said, is our crime rate actually up? And he says, well, actually, it's down. Actually, it's down. We're having a long period of relatively low crime. And I said, well, it seems to me then that what's actually happening is because we have access to every bad thing happening everywhere now we have a very different impression of the way reality actually is, and it's because we are now receiving more accounts, more stories, more tales, more narratives than human beings have in the past, right? At the same time, though, there's always been some level of competition going on. There's always been some level of people saying, no, this is the truth. This is what actually happened. Right? I mean, one of the things we've done over and over again on this podcast is to show how the scripture itself is correcting pagan accounts of what's going on spiritually, what's going on, and historically, you know, all this kind of thing, right? And so I think, you know, I think on. On a personal, familial, you know, parental, you said you guys are, you know, have children on that level or, you know, for people who are pastors, that the key thing is to learn what the story of the scriptures, the story of Christianity truly is and to learn to tell it well and to keep telling it and to. Especially if you have children, to make sure that they're in that story and that they understand that that's what's going on. Right? It's not about shielding them from the world, but it is about shaping them with what really is actually true, right? And when you shape them with that, I've seen this with my own kids, when you shape them with that, and then they encounter some messed up, broken version, distortion, whatever, they can see that for what it is, right? Like a good example, for instance, like you began by talking about pronouns, right? And you said, I don't want to get political. And, you know, I'm a little bit of a scholar of the English language. And I'm like, well, it's not a political thing at all. This is linguistic. You know, how many genders are there? Well, linguistically, there's at least three, right? You know, you've got masculine, feminine, and neutral, but that's language. That's not human beings. You know, English doesn't happen to have or has very little in way of grammatical gender left. You know, we refer to ships as she, interestingly enough, but you know, we don't like the French. We don't refer to tables as she. We don't think of tables as having gender. Right. But this is one of the things I think that's, this is an example, you know, what is the story of what it means to be human being? Well, it doesn't include being able to define. I mean, sex is the traditional word to refer to male and female amongst human beings, right? Not gender. Now we use gender to mean that and I totally understand that language changes, although as I tell people, I know the language changes, that doesn't mean I have to like it. But nonetheless, but nonetheless, what is that all about, right? This sort of gender bending thing going on? It's about telling a story that isn't true. That's what it is. It's about telling a story that isn't true. But I've seen this in terms of people that I've worked with directly. Someone who, for instance, who starts to say, someone who's clearly female who starts to say, well, I'm a boy. One person that I know of that that's the case, they actually in their life never had any clear sense of this is what a woman is, this is what a man is in their own home, right? So in other words, they never actually learned the story of what it means to be a man and what it means to be a woman. And so, of course they're going to be confused about that, you know, and so, you know, we have to be better storytellers, frankly, and we have to understand what the story is better, frankly. And we get so many narratives and so many stories from so many directions all the time. I think one of the best things that we can do is just turn some of it off. My job, I work on the Internet and frankly, I just get sick of the Internet sometimes actually on a daily basis a little bit. And so I've reduced some of my social media engagement just for the sake of my own safety. Insanity, right? You know, and I'm going on a rant now, but I mean, you know, I encourage people, read to your children. This has become less of a thing now. Read good stories to your children. Read, you know, yourself, like, spend time reading. Engagement with good stories is part of the way that we engage with the story that all good stories are ultimately referencing. Right? So like I said, I don't Believe in relativism. I don't think it's really a thing for most people. It's exhausting to actually try to hold that as a belief. And it's almost impossible. Everyone believes something, right? They believe that something is true, even if it's. I just don't want to suffer, right, but, but, but the problem is that there's a confusion and a feeling of a kind of fracturing, a personal fracturing that occurs when we are constantly bombarding ourselves with all of these different ways of understanding and seeing the world, right? And there are good stories and bad stories, and I don't just mean in terms of quality. There are good stories and there are evil stories, right? There are stories that are telling the wrong story, right? And so we need to become discerning to see how that. How that works. But, you know, Father Stephen's right. I mean, the whole swath of history is about stories clashing into each other. And one of the great claims of Christianity is to say, no, wait, this is the true story. This is the real one, right? And that can be uncomfortable to encounter. But the way that we convey and communicate that story, right, which is what evangelism is, has to communicate it in such a way that people can receive it. So it's not just like a competing claim like, oh, we have the true religion. It's like, okay, well, that's great. You have the true religion, but are you actually communicating Christ to people? Just saying I'm right is not communicating Christ, right? So I don't know. That's maybe more than you were looking for, but it's an important question. And how do we convey the gospel to people in this very contested experience that we're having, which may not well be that different from previous generations. I mean, certainly the apostles, right, the apostles were living in a very multi religious, multicultural, you know, society, right? Like, how many different kinds of religions did they bump into? A lot. You know, I mean, like, we use the word paganism, but that really refers to hundreds, if not thousands of different kinds of religion, right? And they were dealing with that, and they were dealing with all the different sects of Judaism. They were dealing with that. And then, of course, then heresy begins to rise within Christianity. So you've got that going on. So, you know, that's not to say, you know, quit whining, because we've always been going through this, but rather to say, like, let's draw some courage from their experience, because we are there, too. We're not in a period of Christendom. We're definitely not there. We're in a period much more like the apostles, in my opinion. In my opinion. So rant over."}

So it seems to me that, you know, we must see ourselves within a story, and we're aligned with the story of humankind. The best story that we're ever going to give or ever receive, I should say. And we should try to stay aligned with that, and that's the importance of the faith. If I could summarize."}

So my question is, in First Peter, chapter three, Saint Peter says that Christ descended into Hades and preached to the spirits in prison who were disobedient in the time of Noah. And I am wondering. I've seen multiple interpretations of who the spirits are, and I've seen that they are the sons of God who fell in Genesis 6, and I've seen that they are the disembodied human souls in the prison of Hades. And I am wondering which one is the correct interpretation or is it some other option?"}

No, this is, this is a, this is a key passage on this in terms of the patristic interpretation of this. Right. Because probably the church father who's most famous for switching to the Sethite interpretation of Genesis 6, 1, 4, meaning the interpretation that the sons of God and daughters of men are referring to the lines of Seth and cain, respectively, is St. Augustine. And so he's really. There were a couple before that. He's not the first one, but he's sort of the pivotal one. And when St. Augustine comes to that text in St. Peter's Epistle, he admits he doesn't know what to do with it because he basically, he interprets it as Christ going and preaching to spirits in Hades. But St. Augustine just openly admits, I don't know why the ones from Noah's time would get another chance as opposed to other souls in Hades. Right. He's got. He says he's got nothing. Right. And to me, that makes the point that this passage is really. I mean, if St. Augustine didn't know what to do, that means this is a big problem for that, that point of view. So part of the issue is that people have understood the proclamation that Christ is making there in the sense of the gospel and the gospel in the sense of an invitation."}

He sort of goes on this, and this is common in apocalyptic literature. He's taken on this tour by angelic guides of the earth and the heavens and the underworld. And when he's in the underworld, he sees the place where the watchers are imprisoned, where the rebellious angels who are involved in Genesis 6:1:4, where they are imprisoned. And they ask Enoch, hey, man, can you go talk to God for us if you're heading up that way and see if you can get us some, some mercy? Now they don't repent, right. They just say, hey, can you get God to ease up on the punishment kind of idea? And so Enoch says, well, sure, because he's a good guy. And so when he's in the heavens, he asks, he sort of prays and tries to intercede for them and say, hey, is there any way you can show mercy on them? And God basically says no.

But like I said, I don't have time to go into all that now. It's coming up on the whole Council of God though, so you can listen to it there eventually. But Second Peter is even clearer about the angels who sinned. Right. It's very clear that this is what St. Peter is referring to. And so he's sort of paralleling that story about Enoch. Right. But it's actually Christ who does it. That one of the things he does during his descent into Hades, as he's bringing the fathers up out of Sheol, up out of Hades, is he proclaims to those rebellious angelic spirits their doom. Right.

I really enjoyed them, and after I listened to them, I started reading two of the recommended books, namely the Bodies of God and the World of Ancient Israel and the Glory of the Invisible God by Andrei Orloff. And so these authors emphasize this idea of the glory of God not as something immaterial, like God's plan, or, let's say, or honor, but as a kind of manifestation of God, something like maybe his body, or the manifestation of his body, which has to be shielded from the people. So God's glory is shrouded inside a cloud or inside the darkness. And I also remembered that there are many passages in the Old Testament where I think we can say that the Father might be present and he is clouded by this darkness, so the people would not be in his direct presence and would not die. And I know that this idea of the glory, the word glory, comes from the Hebrew kavod, I think it is. And I know it means also weight or mass. And at some point, in a commentary on his blog, Father Stephen said that when Moses asked To see God's glory. He was asking to see the Father in his essence, which he could not do and live. So basically, I'm asking, what exactly is God's glory? If it is particular to a certain person of the Holy Trinity, or it's a general manifestation of God's, or what exactly is it?"}

I mean, I know what glory is, humanly speaking. Like, in terms of, like, for instance, the Greek word which refers to reputation or opinion and various kinds of things like that, Right? It's the things that people say about someone or about something else. But I think this is something much deeper. So, Father, he referenced a blog post you made. What's going on? What is the glory of God?"}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #035 - 2022-01-13 - Pantheon and Pandemonium II - Live Q&A January 2022","start":4397.01,"end":4611.92,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Yeah, yeah. So part of the difficulty with this is that the English word glory and even the Greek word doxa is used to translate two different Hebrew words which are slightly different. And so that can sometimes make it confusing, right? So there's the Hebrew word that you brought up, kavod, which refers to, as you said, weight, sort of weight or mass or heaviness, right? Literally, that has that kind of essential quality to it. And that's what. What Summer and Orlov are referring to when they're talking about the glory being this kind of bodily, kind of substantive thing. But there's also another Hebrew word, shekinah, which is also translated as glory. And that's more what's used to refer to, like, the Theophanic glory cloud that we've talked about, right? When the glory of God fills the tabernacle and there's sort of this flaming cloud, right? That kind of idea of glory, right? Or the glory of Christ that shone like the sun on the Mount of Transfiguration on Mount Tabor. And so those aren't unrelated concepts, right? But they're not identical things, right? So, so that type of glory, right? The glory of Mount Tabor is precisely seen by humans who don't die, right? Peter and St. John both talk about having seen his glory at that moment. And so that's one thing. And then Moses, as you mentioned, when he asks to see God's glory, and we've referred to that again because that's in the same chapter where it says that he spoke to him face to face, spoke to God face to face, and then he says, I want to see your glory. And God says, no, if you see me, you'll die. Right? And that's where it's kavod. That's where it's this. This other idea. So I Think in both cases. In both cases, this is something that doesn't apply to just one person of the Trinity. Right. So on the one side with the Shekinah, if we're talking about that kind of glory, this is the glory that Christ says in St. John's Gospel, he shared with the Father before the world began. Right. And it's that glory that he temporarily and humbling himself in the Incarnation. Right. Does not display. It gets displayed momentarily at Mount Tabor, but then again fully at the Ascension. But also, if we're talking about God's essence of who he is, we profess that the Holy Trinity is one in essence. Right. And so there is a sense in which that does not refer just to the Father, Right. But also to Christ and to the Holy Spirit. Right. So there is one glory of the divine nature in both senses. Right. And yeah, I think that does that answer. Is that what you were looking for, or was there something more? Okay, all right."}

But I can lay it out a little bit here. I can lay it out a little bit here. I don't know how much of summer you've read, but in the ancient near east, gods were seen to have multiple bodies. I mean, not just that's what idols were, but gods had a liturgical body is how it's referred to by scholars. Meaning that the God had a hypostasis that was manifest ritually, Right. Within worship. Right. So there is with the, with the cherubim that were in the Holy of holies. This was the throne of God, Right. And the God seated upon that throne became visible on the day of atonement, but also became visible to Isaiah, right. When he receives his call, and Ezekiel. And so this is not the only time. But so my understanding is that in those prophetic visions, right, that they are seeing Christ, but also that in worship, what we're told in the New Testament is that Christ is in our midst, right? When we, when we worship, right. Whenever two or three are gathered, right. So when we're gathered liturgically, it is Christ who is in our midst. And so I take that understanding back to the day of atonement. Now, I'm not saying if someone disagrees with me and could make another argument, but that's the way I understand it, right? I'm not saying this as in like, no, this is the only way it could be, but this is my opinion based on those things I just said, is that it was Christ who appeared."}

So this two part question, the second part might actually blend into the first, but you're probably aware that over the last several years, there's been this increased public conversation concerning what the government's calling unidentified aerial phenomena, which is really UFOs as we would traditionally know them. And of course, that conversation has sparked the possibility that intelligent extraterrestrial life may be out there, or even ultra terrestrial life living somewhere in secret here on the planet. And of course, the Bible is silent on all of these issues, of course, you know, and it's also silent on, you know, how to build a combustion engine. But we know combustion engines exist. So the secularists seem to view this as a positive thing. And, you know, they look upon this as being the return of the extraterrestrials who created mankind. This blends very much into the ancient near east, kind of Anunnaki and so on. And of course, they kind of see this as, you know, the coming of a new messiah. And of course, they argue that Christianity would crumble underneath such a revelation if true extraterrestrials were discovered. And you're probably aware of, you know, the church has dealt with this in, in the very distant past through the conversation of the plurality of worlds and, you know, the possibility of a planet hopping Jesus who's, you know, incarnates on every single planet in the universe, which really ended underneath Thomas Paine, who said that was ridiculous. So in the modern church, this is really rarely addressed other than the Catholics and the Pope and many of his priests have said that they're ready to evangelize the aliens when they come, including baptizing them and welcoming them as fellow imagers. So I'm curious, and I know you may have to speculate, but how does the Orthodox Church view the possibility of intelligent extraterrestrial life. And how would it respond to this kind of revelation if it was revealed? And of course, the second part is, do you believe Sasquatch is related to the giants, either pre or post flood? And if so, are they chimeras?"}

Yes, it's a rule. Yeah, yeah, I'll say. Okay, the first thing I'll say is, since you asked explicitly, what is the Orthodox church's view on UFOs? The Orthodox Church qua Orthodox Church has not. Not that. I mean, correct me if I'm wrong here, Father Stephen, but has not put forth any statements at all about the possibility of the way that we normally think of extraterrestrial, intelligent beings. I mean, it's funny, like, is there extraterrestrial intelligent life? I'm like, yeah, we talk about vast cosmic intelligences all the time on this show, you know, but the idea of, like little green men or essentially something that's sort of analogous to mankind, that's from some other place. I'm not aware of the Church as the Church saying anything about that. Is there anything like that, Father?"}

I think it's just garbage because number one. That's number one. You're arguing from a hypothetical. Like, to me, this is like, well, what if God could make a rock so big that he couldn't lift it? Like, there's a sort of definitional issue there. Right. So I. I could hype. I could, you know, like, well, what if we discovered that there was more than, you know, that there were more than one Holy Trinity, that there were six holy Trinities? You know, that would kill theology, wouldn't it? You know, like. Okay, I. I can say stuff like that, but Christianity is not a. Is about dealing with what has actually been revealed to us. Right, right. You know, so. So there, There's. There's that as a kind of problem. And.

And you definitely helped me bring. Bring me back to the faith. So thanks very much for that. So I've been reading through Exodus lately, and just before Moses leads the Israelites out of Egypt, and during the plagues, it's repeatedly mentioned that Yahweh hardens Pharaoh's heart. So sometimes it's like passive. It says Pharaoh's heart was hardened, but it's implied that Yahweh causes it. And then other times it's more active. So it actually says that Yahweh hardened Pharaoh's heart. And then also a couple of times it says that Pharaoh hardened his own heart. So I looked around before and I found all sorts of very different answers to this. So some say that it's that God created, like, psychological laws, and then from that sort of, he let Pharaoh through pride and through his sins, just let his heart be hardened. And then others say that it's like a hyperbolic way of saying the same thing, that it's to punish Pharaoh. So what's the sort of traditional understanding of this? Is it to show Yahweh's full power to the Egyptians that he keeps actively hardening his heart? It seems like, you know, if he didn't actively harden it, then at some point maybe Pharaoh would have let the Israelites go earlier. Like one of his Mages tell him that, you know, look at Egypt, it's destroyed. You should just let them go. And then it says Yahweh hardened his heart and he didn't. So. Yeah, could you maybe explain that?"}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #035 - 2022-01-13 - Pantheon and Pandemonium II - Live Q&A January 2022","start":5807.35,"end":5902.17,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Yeah, it's a good question. I mean, so if you were to do, you know, if you look at all this, all these accounts from Exodus, there's actually three different ways that this is talked about. So on the one hand it says Pharaoh's heart was hardened. Right. So it's like you said, there's a sort of this passive voice. It just sort of describes it happening. But. And it also says that Pharaoh hardened his own heart. Right? So like Exodus 8:15, when you know, Pharaoh, he hardened his heart, but then it also says that the Lord hardened his heart and you get, you know, God himself saying, I will harden Pharaoh's heart. So like, all of that stuff is in play throughout the whole Exodus account. Right. So. And I think one of the problems is if we try to pick one of those and use it to kind of eliminate the other two. Right. You know, so if you're going to do a Calvinist reading of it, you would basically say, you know, well, God and hardened Pharaoh's heart. And that's what all of this really means. If you were going to take, you know, a more sort of, you know, the opposite view, say, well, this is all Pharaoh's own doing, etc. And then. And I guess maybe the other would be kind of neutral. But I mean, it's. There's clearly just from the text of Scripture, it's clear that Pharaoh is doing something, and it's clear also that God is doing something. Right. So I don't know. That's at least what I'm seeing from the text itself. So, Father Stephen, what would you say about this stuff from Exodus?"}

And so the first place we have to start is with the question of what is God doing? Right. So if we come at it from the perspective of God is trying to get Pharaoh to let Israel go, that's what he's doing then. Yeah, it kind of looks like he's playing games or something because Pharaoh would have done that. Right. But I would submit that that's not what God is trying to do, because first of all, if that's what he wanted to do, he wouldn't have had to do the plagues, Right. He could have Struck Pharaoh dead."}

They see him as. Well, we could go too far this. Because it depends then you get into which pharaoh and all this stuff. But they saw him as one of the bodies of one of the gods, right? Depending on when exactly historically you think this took place. Place. Maybe Horus, maybe someone else. But so he's one of the gods of Egypt. And justice biblically is not punishment for crimes. Justice is restoring the correct order, the correct good order of the creation when it has been thrown out of whack, right? And so we have a century and a half of the oppression of the people of Israel. We have the murder of the infant boys of, of Israel by this Pharaoh. We have all manner of these things that have happened. And so the scales are out of whack, right? Pharaoh has exalted himself by humiliating and punishing and oppressing and exploiting the, the Israelites, God's people. And so God is going to set that right, right. He's going to put things right in Egypt, right. And so if you're an Israelite who's been being oppressed and victimized, that's good news. If you're an Egyptian and especially if you're Pharaoh, that's really bad news, right? And part parcel of that with the gods is God showing that those gods who they've been worshiping and following and really been enslaved to are not who they should be following. Right. And the plagues are targeted. We may do an episode on this at some point. The plagues are pretty well targeted at the Egyptian gods. The, the. And all of them are targeted at Pharaoh because Pharaoh's job, the Egyptian word for what I'm calling justice, it's mishpat in Hebrew, it's ma'. At. In, in Egyptian was this idea that everything is in its proper place and functioning properly. They had the same concept of justice, but that was the Pharaoh's job. The pharaoh was basically a priest king whose job was to interact with the gods and rule over humans and make sure everything stayed in the right place and functioned properly. And each one of the plagues is things going out of Whack. He can't put it back in order. Even his magicians. This is part of what's going on in the text. Janus and Jambres, right? His magicians, they can make things worse. It's like, oh, look, we could turn water into blood too. We can't turn the blood back to water, but we can make more blood."}

Hey, we could make some more frogs. Like, we need them, you know? So, yeah, they could create more chaos, but they can't put things. Put things back in order. And so at a certain point, yes, Pharaoh would have relented. But notice Pharaoh never repents. As soon as he finally does let the Israelites go, he changes his mind and chases them down to kill them all right? For embarrassing him. So he never repents. This isn't God keeping him from repenting. This is just God making sure his whole plan plays out to redress the injustice that they've been committed that has been committed against his people and by extension, against him. Right? To make this display that the gods of Egypt are phonies. Not that they don't exist, but that they aren't. They aren't rightly worshiped as gods. And to make that display not only to the Egyptians, to the Egyptians, to the Israelites. And when they get to Canaan, Rahab's heard about it. The other nations have heard about it, Right? And so he's making sure that all plays out because he knows Pharaoh isn't going to repent. Right. He might have let them go after the sixth plague, but he would have chased them down and tried to kill them just like he did after the 10th plague."}

A tree has a will, and that will, it's not making choices, but that will is sort of the internal biological force that causes it to grow and move towards the perfection of its nature."}

I understand your argument that God transcends time. He's not bound by time. But for him to know the future as an actuality would require that I also transcend time. It seems like it is a block. A block model of the universe where each moment exists in eternity. Like. Like the Hindu. Hindu version. And I don't know how to. With Brian from Austin. You talked about logical absurdities, that God is free and powerful to do anything except commit a logical absurdity, which I agree with. But it seems like absolute foreknowledge of what I'm going to do in the future is a logical absurdity because I do not. I exist only in time. I understand God does not. But how would he know my future as an actuality if I exist at this moment in time? A block. A block model of the universe means that all moments exist at once."}

So, I mean, there's a whole host of things we could say here. But. But I think one thing that I would say is, and this is a saying that I love, which is there is no tale without a teller. And how that's applicable to this is to say that from. From the point of view of human beings who are alive in this life, it seems that time moves in a linear fashion. Right. You know, that there's a past, a present future, and I don't know what's going to happen in the future, and I only have memories of the past and I'm present in the present. Right. But then if you take it out, if you try then to see it from God's point of view, which Is like what your question is kind of predicated upon. Upon, Right. To say that all points exist already. That's essentially to say, okay, I'm imagining the way God experiences or sees all of this, and this is what that must be like. Right. The problem with that is that's a tale that. That. That human beings are not the teller of. Right. You know, as we like to say, we don't know what it's like to be a bat. We definitely don't know what it's like to be an angel, and we certainly, certainly do not know what it's like to be God. So it's setting up a logical model in the mind that then becomes contradictory, especially because we don't actually have the ability to see things from that point of view. Right. We can only imagine what that point of view must be like. But the problem is that our imagination doesn't line up with the actual view. Right. So, and I mentioned. I began by saying that part of the problem is that it's human beings in this life experiencing things in this way, because human beings who have moved beyond this life. So for instance, the saints, they have a different perspective now. They still don't have the same perspective that God does because they're not God, but they have a perspective that we do not have because we're in this life. And they have shifted in what my dogmatics professor would say that they've moved into an angelic time zone, although even then they don't know what it's like to be that kind of creature, although it's something a little bit more like that. Right. So that's part of the problem, is that it's setting up definitions that are by their nature contradictory and by their nature require us to imagine things that we don't actually have the ability to see. Right. So, you know, it's like the mantis shrimp we talked about. I don't know, it's been like a year ago, hasn't it? Now maybe that sees all these colors that we cannot even imagine. We can sort of detect that they are able to do that by scientific means, but we still don't actually even have the ability to see that. Right. You know, we can just imagine it in a really precise way, I suppose, but we can't actually see that. Right. So that is at least one way that I would understand the. The problem of the question that you're asking and why it seems unsolvable from our point of view. Father Stephen, you want to, you know, I'm actually me or. Or Add or subtract or whatever."}

So we have to see part of the. Part of the whole. Man, I wonder if people are like, if, if Thomas Nagel is monetizing this somehow and he should, like, people are downloading the. What is it like to be a bat? And he's got this huge spurt from us orthodox folks, you know, but, but see, when, when we think about what it's like to be a bat, what we're doing is we're projecting, right? What would it be like if my consciousness was in a bat body, Right. Like if a wizard turned me into a bat, Right. Like, because we can only understand things from our human perspective, right? And so when we try to think of, well, what would it mean to be like outside of time, what would that be like? Our frame of reference is we tend to. When we try and think about time because it's even more difficult. We tend to think about it the way we think about space, right? So like, we think about, well, I'm here in the church office in Lafayette, Louisiana, right. And right. I don't know what's going on in, you know, London on a particular street right now, right? I have no idea. Right. But we would say, well, God does, right? And so we tend to think of it kind of that way, right? Well, God is in heaven outside of time, but he knows what's happening at all the different moments, right? Or God is in heaven and he knows what's happening in all the different places. Places on earth, right? But if we think about that a little more with space, that's not what we actually believe about God, right? Because we believe that God doesn't just know what's going on everywhere, but we say that God is not spatially located. So it's not that God is here in the office with me, but he does know what's going on in London. He is in London just as much as he's here in this office. Just as. As much as much as he's everywhere else, right. In creation. And so time wise, we end up with the same thing. But that's even harder for us to conceive of, right? We being finite humans, we have to process reality through certain categories that are embedded in our consciousness, in the shape of our consciousness. And time and time and space are two of those. Those are two categories that are embedded in our consciousness. And we can't make sense of the world apart from them. But that doesn't mean that they're absolute in the universe. That Just means they're embedded in our consciousness and we can't think outside of those categories. We can guess and imagine and analogize, but that's different than really understanding. And so even talking about God having a consciousness is like a weird analogy that breaks down, right? Saying, what is it like to be God? I don't know that there is a thing that it's like to be God. Right. At least analogous to what it's like to be a human or a bat, right?"}

And so God does whatever that would be. Right. Again, we're approaching this apophatically, right? We at negativa, right, where we say we can't have any idea what it's like from God's perspective, but we can make negative statements, right. That his knowledge. What's knowledge for him, which is going to be different than knowledge for us, but is not going to be contained within those categories. It's not going to be restricted by those categories. Right? So if. If I as a human. If I as a human knew for certain what you were going to do tomorrow, then there would be no free will, right? Because that's how human knowledge works. Right.

Because, you know, I realize that it seems to me in our English language, we use these words pretty interchangeably many times, but as I understood it, Hades and Sheol, which are the same place, just different names, different languages. That's the place where one went when they died prior to Christ's resurrection. And you're dead. You're just dead. There you're not being punished or anything like that. That is where Christ descended to upon his crucifixion and liberated everyone. And that hell is a different place or even a condition in which one is suffering in the presence of God as punishment after their final judgment."}

So, okay, so, Peter, you start out by saying that in English, people tend to use Hades, Hell, and Sheol interchangeably. And I'm going to begin by saying that's because they actually are interchangeable. And one of the things about English is that we have a lot of words that came into English from different languages, and sometimes the words do really mean the same thing. Now, sometimes we. We tend to use them differently or whatever. And I have heard people use, for instance, Hades and Hel, you know, to try to distinguish them from each other. But, but here's the thing. All three of those words. So Hades comes from Greek. Hel comes from our Germanic inheritance, and Sheol is a Semitic word. All three of these words refer to the place of the dead, the underworld, and all three of these words also refer to deities that have control of those places. Or it may also be said we could say that being dead is being in the control of that deity. Right? So, like, you know, in Greek mythology, Hades is the name of the God of the underworld, and it's also the underworld. Right. In Germanic mythology, which includes Norse, Hel is the underworld, and it's also the goddess. Interestingly, in Norse mythology, it's a she who is the lady of the underworld. Right? So, you know, and it goes on and on in almost every single culture that has a word for the underworld. Usually that same word, or sometimes a closely related word is the name of the deity that controls the place. Right? And. And so it's. It's got both. Now, I think in terms of the way that English usage tends to be, Hell is a word that is more commonly known in English than. Than the other two. And so then there's these images of. Of fire and. And so on and so forth. And so then some, Some. Some orthodox like to say, well, we don't believe in hell, we believe in Hades. And they're trying to make a distinction between the two. But. But doesn't work because the basic concepts are essentially the same across all these cultures. Right? And. And all these words had a history in paganism. In addition to Their use in scripture and in Christian theology. Right. All of these words are. Are, you know, have that history. So it's, It's a common concept. So. But it's interesting if you look at what it says in the book of Revelation, it actually says that this. That the underworld gets cast into the lake of fire. Right. So there's this notion that the place of the dead gets. Then gets placed in this other place, so to speak, which is just specifically described in fiery terms. Right. So. So I think on one level, you are on the right track, that there is. That there's a distinction between. Between those two experiences. Right. There's a distinction between the experience of death before the end and then there's the experience of what happens with that place and all those associated with it after the end. Right. After the resurrection. Right. But it just doesn't work out to say that the first is Hades and the second is hell, because Germanic peoples have been using the word hell to refer to that underworld pretty much as long as that word has existed. Right. And the reason why we have it in English is simply because when the Bible was translated into English, they used the existing Germanic term that is native to English. Right. For that. I mean, the word hell shows up in Beowulf, for instance, to refer to specifically the underworld. Right. Not necessarily a place of the damned after the resurrection, if that makes sense. So, yeah. So in terms of the English words, that's kind of where those things flowed out. Father, I don't know if you wanted to add anything on top of that, maybe to expand on the whole lake of fire thing or whatever."}

There's realms of the dead after that, what are called the intermediate state. And then there is. Right. Eternal condemnation after the Last Judgment. And sometimes different terms will be assigned to those three different places or realities. Right. By certain authors in order to distinguish them from each other.

So, I mean, should we really be referring to that more as the Lake of Fire than hell? We should be introducing that more into our language."}

When I'm talking about after the Last Judgment, I tend to refer to eternal condemnation. Because the lake of fire is one image that you get in St. Matthew's gospel in Revelation that they're picking up from the Book of Enoch. There's another mark on your bingo card. But there's also outer darkness, a place of weeping and ash. Right. There are other images, right? Gehenna. There are other images for that same reality in the New Testament. So I use it. Tend to use eternal condemnation and then refer to those various images that are given of what that is. All of which are just trying to say, this is really bad. Do not want. Right. Repent. Right."}

I like to use, especially when we're talking about the place of the dead prior to all these things. I like to use that phrase, the place of the dead. I also like to talk about the underworld, right? Because. Because. Especially because those are terms that are not bandied around as much. And so when you use language that people are not as familiar with, then it gives you the opportunity to define it for them. Whereas if you just throw in. I mean, I don't tend to use the word hell very often. But like, when someone says to me, well, hell is better than Hades or Hades is better than hell, I'm like, well, the problem with turning them into different technical terms like that is that then people then go back and look at the Bible and other texts, and then they want to apply them as technical terms when they may not have been used in those texts in that way. Especially when you're talking about translations, right? So like in many cases, like many English Bibles throughout history, when they See, the Greek word Hades, they translate it with the English word hell because the Greek word Hades had not yet made its way into English as the English word Hades. Right. It's just because they had this pre existing concept. Yes, it's true. They're not thinking of the Anglo Saxon underworld more is the pity, because the Anglo Saxon underworld was much more similar to the Greek underworld in terms of the concept there. And then Sheol gets translated often as I think it's the grave in the King James Bible. Is that right? The grave."}

So I think the key thing is to understand that there is a sort of state of the dead prior to Christ. There's other things, other states of the dead after Christ's harrowing of hell, Hades slash seal, and then there's what, you know, then there's the. After the resurrection. Right. So you've got these different kinds of stages. And then the important thing, especially when talking about our teaching, is to just describe what those look like based on the Scriptures and what the church fathers say about it. You know, and if you have to, if you are picking words, you know, from these inheritance of words that we have, then then define them very, very clearly as you go. Because as you said, there is confusion on this point. Right. A lot of people have this idea of like there's heaven and there's hell and that you go to one or the other after you die and hell has those, you know, demons sticking pitchforks in your butt and heaven has angels playing harps on clouds. Right. I mean, all of this is false. Right. So, you know, yeah, we have to have to have a little bit more robust understanding of what's going on after all of this. So does that make sense?"}

So a couple months ago, my father passed away kind of suddenly. He had cancer, but he died of a heart attack shortly before he was going to come and live with us. And we've been orthodox for, you know, a decade or so. And my dad was kind of a nominal non believer a lot of things, but so I didn't really, I was Kind of preparing for, caring for my family and caring for my father. I didn't spend a lot of time praying or not praying, but caring for his salvation, you know. And so it's been kind of a complicated loss for me. And my priest was telling me, you know, pray the Jesus prayer. I've been doing that kind of, you know, all the time. Every time I think about it, pray for him and that it's, in some ways it was very comforting for me and kind of gave me a way to care for him now. And so I'll just say I do have questions, I promise. On the morning of my son's birthday last week, I had a dream and it sort of reminded me a little bit of what we believe happens after we pass. You know, our soul is separate from our body and that it was kind of like my dad was sort of reanimating in a way, like he was kind of coming back to a body, you know, started with just his head and he was kind of wiggling his face around, getting it to kind of move again and everything. And his body eventually came back and then I was able to. He called my name and I embraced him and it was the most wonderful and peace filled and, you know, just wonderful dream. And I woke up still feeling his warmth and his presence. So now I'm not saying that the theologically sound dream, it could be the mind's way of coping. But my questions, and these are two, two parted questions. The first question is what happens when a non believer passes away and a believer then prays for that person? Can they come to know God after death through prayers? So that's the first question. Second question, is it common for loved ones who have passed on to manifest in some way to those that are left behind and have it not be like a demonic experience? Make sense?"}

These are good questions. You know, to the first one, the one one thing I have many times said to people who have this concern, I mean in my own family I have people who, who were explicitly atheist. My grandfather was an atheist and as far as we know remained one until he died, that you never know exactly what is going on in someone's heart, especially in their last hours and days. And of course in the modern period, for many people, those last hours and days are spent in sleep. From the point of view of the rest of us, we don't know what's going on. I've had multiple experiences in pastoral ministry that indicate to me that there are other things going on besides what's simply observable Someone might say, oh, well, they never confessed faith in Christ before they finally went to sleep, and then they died later. And I've known a lot of Christians that then became hopeless over their loved ones as a result of seeing that. Right. But for instance, there are many times over the years that I went and prayed over someone who was dying, you know, at home or in the hospital. And in many cases, they had hung on for a long time, and then the family finally called in the priest and I went in and prayed. And many times then within an hour, or in one case, literally as I was walking out the room, that they finally died. Right. Which is an indication that the prayer that we did together had an effect, you know, that God heard the prayer and something happened. I mean, I can't say for certain exactly what happened, but I mean, it became so like. In my first parish, I served as an assistant pastor, actually a job that Father Stephen later had. We had both had the same job, but not at the same time. There was a period in which I think that within the space of a week, like three or four people, that that exact same thing happened in very short, very short order that I prayed the final prayer of the departure of the soul from the body, and then the person died within like an hour or less. And it was. It became like, so known throughout the parish that there was one point where the senior pastor actually joked at a parish council meeting, now, look, unless you guys vote the way that I want you to, I'm sending Father Andrew to your house to pray over you. But, yes, Father Olaf was my boss, a wonderful, wonderful priest. And so, I mean, there's definitely something going on there that is not visible to most people, right? So we don't know. We don't know exactly what's happening inside someone's heart before the end. And then also, you know, connected with what you asked about our prayer for them, I mean, it's the same thing, right? I mean, you can't repent once you're parted from your body, but other people can repent for your benefit, right? That is why we pray for our departed. We pray that God would have mercy on them. You know, we do the things to draw close to Christ and to advance in holiness, and we do it specifically remembering our loved ones, not because we think that that sort of cancels out however they happen to live their life, or we think that we can shoulder all of it for them or whatever, but simply, this is what the body of Christ does, and we do have an effect on each other's salvation. So we don't know exactly the fate of anybody that we know until, you know, until the end comes. But we do live in hope for them. And I do pray for my atheist grandfather. I pray for, you know, a lot of departed in my family. Who's the state of their soul? I have no idea, you know, but I, but I, but I do pray for them. And so, yeah, it's, this is absolutely a thing and it's a good, good thing that, that we do. So, yeah, I mean, and I think there's reason to be comforted over it. Like, again, we don't know for certain, but we do know that this is what we're supposed to do. I mean, so, you know, the advice that your priest gave you to pray the Jesus prayer is definitely very, very good advice and to pray it for your father, Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on my dad, you know, so, so, yeah, and. And you know, with regards to your second question, do people sometimes communicate with their, their relatives? I mean, it is a thing. It is a thing if, you know, by, if, if God wills it. I don't know if it happened in your particular case, but, but it certainly is. Is a thing. So I don't know. Father Stephen, I know you have thoughts on. About all of this stuff."}

Part of this whole issue is clouded because even as Orthodox Christians, we're not really in an Orthodox environment most of the time. And so we default to. I mean, especially in the U.S. american culture is deeply steeped in Puritan Protestantism. So we tend to think of salvation as sort of transition, transactional way. Right. That there's this thing you have to do. And if you do it, we may disagree about exactly what it is, but whatever it is, you have to do it while you're alive. And then having done it, whether it's praying a prayer or being baptized or whatever particular thing, making some kind of commitment, if you haven't done it, then that's it. If you have done it, then you're good. Right?"}

And we also don't have the Roman Catholic view of, well, if you die with an unrepentant mortal sin, like not going to church one Sunday, then too bad. Nothing you could do. Right. We don't have that either. So for us as Orthodox Christians, all of us are on a continuum. Right. A continuum sort of runs from beast to God. Right. In terms of theosis in the one direction and demonization in the other. And all of us are somewhere, right? And as Father Andrew said, we don't know where any other person is. A lot of times we're not even attentive to where we are ourselves, let alone being able to figure out where someone else is. But repentance, then, is not about being sorry or feeling bad or changing your intellectual beliefs, right? Repentance is about being transformed and healed. And that transformation and healing comes through the action of God within the human heart with which we cooperate, right? So this is why, as Father Andrew said, God works through means, right? God can do anything he wants directly, anytime he wants, but out of his love for us, he chooses to work through us, Right? He chooses to bring salvation to people by us sharing the gospel with them. Right? He chooses to show his love and mercy to people by us showing love and kindness and mercy to them. And he chooses to save people through our prayers. We end every service with through the prayers of our holy fathers. Have mercy on us and save us. Right? So God is very much capable of saving your father through your prayers and the prayers of your family. And so part of saying that prayer is offering those prayers to God not because he needs them and he can't do it without them. Not that you're going to change his mind and get him to do something he otherwise wouldn't, but you get to be a part of that, right? Out of his love for you, he's given you the ability to be a part of that. And so that's how I think to think about it in terms of seeing a departed loved one. That literally happens all the time. Just people don't want to talk about it because everybody will think they're crazy, but it happens all the time. And the way to judge what is going on there is by the fruits it produces. If it sows fear and confusion and. And sets you back in your own repentance or causes you to be less vigilant. Right? Like if you. If you had had that experience and you had said, oh, see, my dad's okay. I don't need to pray for him. I don't need to do anything, I would say, oh, whoa, Right. But if it's. If it's an experience that brings peace and love and the joy of Christ, then it's something to be thankful for."}
