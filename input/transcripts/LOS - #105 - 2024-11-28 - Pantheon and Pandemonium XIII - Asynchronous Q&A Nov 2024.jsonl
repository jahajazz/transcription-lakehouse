And he will be the light of the nations and the hope of those whose hearts are troubled. All who dwell on the earth will fall down and worship him. And they will praise and bless and celebrate with song the Lord of spirits the modern world doesn't acknowledge, but is nevertheless haunted by spirits, angels, demons and saints. In our time, many yearn to break free of the prison of a flat secular materialism, to see and to know reality as it truly is. What is this spiritual reality like? How do we engage with it? Well, how do we permeate everyday life with spiritual presence? Orthodox Christian priests Father Andrew Stephen Damick and Fr. Stephen DeYoung host this live call in show focused on enchantment in creation, the union of the seen and unseen as made by God and experienced by mankind throughout history. Welcome to the Lord of Spirits."}

This episode, though, is sponsored by the Orthodox Studies Institute at St Constantine College, which exists to advance the study and application of Orthodox Christianity and faithfulness to holy tradition. By popular demand, OSI is bringing back you, Father Stephen, to teach a live course on the Book of Jubilees, taking a deep dive into one of the most important texts in Second Temple Judaism. The course begins on January 7th, runs for four weeks. You can learn more and register@ orthodoxystudies.org Los and if you missed Father Stephen's previous course in the Book of Enoch, you can sign up for jubilees and get $25 off of Enoch by using that link.

My Russians pretty rusty. Actually, I did take one year of Russian in high school long, long ago in the before times. Yeah. The German teacher taught Russian at our high school, so I listened to that and you didn't say anything that I hadn't heard you say before. Right. But just to recap for maybe listeners who haven't listened to it or don't or haven't listened to every single episode or moment or remember every moment. But the. Just correct me if I get some of wrong, but your basic take was the resurrection of the body implies or means that not just implies, means that as St. Paul says, all of the. The chaff of our life is going to be burned away. So all of the bad stuff that we've done, so forth, and then all the good stuff, all the joy, all the holiness, all the love, all the self sacrifice, this gets made eternal. So am I tracking so far?"}

Well, the crucial middle piece in there is that the bodily resurrection requires that we maintain our identity, identity and relationships. Right. That it's us and our identity is not just this static or internal thing, but is made up of our connections to other people and actual events. Right. Our identity is sort of spread out across our whole life."}

So I know that a number of people, like in hearing, when you talked about this on this podcast and in response to that talk where you, you know, put it all in one can together, had this question and I kind of thought about this myself. Now I have an idea about what, how one might respond to this, but I haven't completely worked it out. So I want to hear what you have to say about this, which is for a lot of people, their view of, of the afterlife, they might say that, okay, that makes total sense. But does that mean that the age to come is this sort of crystallized thing where like, for instance, you don't meet anybody new, nothing sort of new happens. And I have the idea that that time is a very much a key component of how we understand this. But here's the wrinkle in the monkey wrench for me, which is that to mix your metaphors. Yes, yes, I know. Well, I'm just throwing out metaphors, you know. Yeah, it's either a wrinkle or a monkey wrench or, you know, whatever is that to be a creature means to be in motion. It means to be changing. Like only God is unchanging and sort of perfectly still, so to speak. So how does that all work?"}

But, but, you know, but there but even like Saint, Saint John of Damascus, for instance, describes the angels as being in motion and they're in this time zone. So expand on this."}

Because preface to this is, as scripture makes clear, we can't right now understand what the world to come is going to be like. And so it offers a series of metaphors and images and ways of thinking about it. So this is just offering another way of thinking about thinking about it. Right. And also people who, you know, I get the usual, like, oh, give me some quotes from church fathers to back up this or that point, to which I say, that's not how you read the church fathers. And if you'd actually read the church fathers, you wouldn't need to ask me that question, as I've seen some people online point out. Right. Some people who actually, like. Some people from Orthodox countries have pointed out like, no, this is from here. This is. You know, also there's some people who seem to think somehow that what I'm saying in the talk is based on Nietzsche."}

And then either time stops and there's no experience of time whatsoever because we're now God and outside of time and not created anymore, or all that happens and then sort of a succession of moments resumes."}

So the same thing about our identity in the eschaton would be true. That's true. Of our identity in this life in terms of it being spread out temporally. But that means something fundamentally different in the eschaton, because time is going to be different. It's not going to cease to exist, but it's going to be different. The same way that it's different for angels. Right. And the motion and change we experience is going to be like the more like, not identical to, but more like the motion and change that angels experience than how we experience it now.

I'm speak piping in to ask a question on the nature of the law via a somewhat humorous question. If Christ were to drive today, would Christ ever get a speeding ticket? I ask this question because it touches on how we tend to view the law as rules to be obeyed. And so we fulfill the law as not breaking the rules, for example, not going over the speed limit. I think we tend to read this understanding back into what we think of when we think of the Torah, namely what the law is and how Christ fulfilled it. In what way is Christ's fulfillment of the law beyond what we would call not breaking the rules or obedience to the rules? In what way is the Torah, the law, different from simple rules? And in what way is obedience different from how we see things, like current traffic codes, another piece of legislation? Maybe it's an issue of civil law being different from religious law. If I'm also going to work in a bonus Lenten question, how does this understanding of the rules and keeping the rules apply to Lent and keeping the fast. Thanks and looking forward to the rest of the series. Wow."}

In order to help us build the discipline and the self control and the self mastery that we need to resist and fight back against the really big and destructive temptations, right?

Or what makes Enoch, for example, less canonical, since it isn't read in church either, even though it is referenced in the New Testament? Why aren't patristic writings, which are read publicly, considered holy Scripture? Famously the paschal homily of St. John Chrysostom. But I understand some monasteries also have patristic readings appointed for orthros. Or what about the Synaxarion, the lives of saints read daily, but also works like the life of Saint Mary of Egypt, which is appointed to be read in Lent, or hymnography, which we sing in church, or the ladder of divine ascent? Isn't all of this canonical? Why do we call some of the older writings Holy Scripture, even if some are never read publicly, but newer writings aren't, even if we do read them? I understand the concept of the Bible as a single volume book is recent, as well as the Protestant understanding of canon vis a vis sola scriptura. These are late and foreign concepts to Orthodoxy. But our faith is a beautiful, seamless whole tradition to us, and it does not originate in one book.

I don't know if they have that tradition too, or not, but the Copts do. It's read on the Isle of Patmos at certain times. There are places where it's read and circumstances in which it's read in the Orthodox Church. But ultimately, what canonicity means in that regard is Saint Nikephoros had more than just the Book of Revelation on his list of New Testament books that some places read, but not others. It's the only one that ended up being seen as canonical. So the usage of it by some churches in the guiding of the Holy Spirit has led us to accept that it is. And then it was not added to the public reading schedule by any bishop so far from what I have seen. And even talking to my own bishop because largely of a practical concern that people take the Book of Revelation to weird places."}

Yeah, phenomenologically it's the same thing still being offered. But I think the core of the way that judgment is understood in scripture is that the judgment that's issued against them, which is sort of strict justice, but is sort of public humiliation, because what is the great sin that they are guilty of? Publicly presenting themselves as God, taking for themselves honors that belong to God. So being kind of publicly stripped of that and humiliated and being shown to be powerless is sort of the judgment. And I think this is the understanding of, for example, the plagues on Egypt that St. Paul is appealing to when he talks about Christ on the cross, having made a public display of the powers. Right. By stripping them of their power and sort of publicly humiliating them is more the idea than that something bad happened to them, like they got, you know, beat up or, I mean, it's exiled somewhere or killed."}

And I mean, in a lot of ways, that's what society is in this fallen world is the pooling of ignorance. By no means do I deny that people have genuine, deep, sincere feelings, but the fact that you have a genuine, deep, sincere feeling does not mean that you should take particular actions based on those feelings.

Because what he's doing is he's doing a very Hebrew thing and he's doing a wordplay on the Hebrew word natser, which means branch or stem. Right. So he says, oh, he's from Nazareth.

And it is people writing in Greek and thinking in Hebrew. And there's example after example after example of it. We've just seen one. When St. Paul says, in, I believe it's Colossians, what gets mistranslated in English as, he who was without sin became sin for us. Yeah, right.

What separates like magic from just pagan religion in general is that pagan religion in general involves some kind of relationship or relational approach to spirits that are regarded as divine. Whereas magic is formulae, often ritual formulae that are aimed to control spiritual forces, not relate to them, not make offerings with them, not make some kind of quid pro quo deal with them, but to directly manipulate them. And so that's why it is closer to a kind of techne. Right.

But Paul operated during his entire life as a faithful Pharisee within the Roman Jewish world. In St. Paul the Pharisee, Jewish apostle to all nations, Father Stephen DeYoung surveys Paul's life and writings, interpreting them within the holy tradition of the Orthodox Church. This survey is followed by DeYoung's interpretive translation of St. Paul's epistles, which deliberately avoids overly familiar terminology. By using words and ideas grounded in 1st century Judaism, DeYoung hopes to unsettle commonly held notions and help the reader reassess St. Paul in his historical context.

I have a question about something that a couple different speakers at the conference said and I could be mischaracterizing Lord of Spirits conference, but I believe what was said was that there are two slightly different views on how and why the demons are allowed to continue to act in the world. And one being, I think sort of more so the modern rabbinic Jewish view was that a certain percentage of the demons were allowed to continue to act in the world to afflict the wicked and drive them to repentance. And the then the more the second more sort of traditionally Christian view is that they are in some way sort of truly rebellious powers. I was wondering if you guys could help me sort of flesh out, like, just to what extent these views differ or if they're. Or if there's some way in which there's actually sort of a complementarity to the two or a sort of a helpful tension. I've found I found something sort of along the lines of the first view kind of helpful in my own life in terms of viewing, you know, bad things that happen to me and sort of making them meaningful. And I like that whole shall prove but mine instrument thing. So thanks."}

Thanks so much for your show. It's really a blessing to me as someone raised Protestant, I'm learning a ton. And I guess as I keep listening to you, I have this one question that keeps kind of haunting me as someone raised Protestant. And I've often wondered if I have the Holy Spirit inhabiting my life. And I've been really disgruntled. Without Protestants talk about this. There seems to be a lot of confusion, lack of clarity about receiving the Holy Spirit, when that happens, how it happens, and as someone entrusted to teach, I just consider it more and more relevant. I need an answer to this question. So my short question is this. What's the role of apostolic authority in receiving the Holy Spirit? I was baptized as a teenager in the name of the father and the son and the Holy Spirit. Was that the moment I received the Holy Spirit, or is an apostolic representative required to anoint me? I guess I just really want to understand properly because I've had sneaking suspicions, you know, do I have the Holy Spirit guiding my life? And so what do you think, do I require an Orthodox priest to impart the Holy Spirit rightly into my life? Quick. P.S. i have spoken with a local Orthodox priest about this. I'd just love to hear you specifically address the Holy Spirit portion of the question. Thanks so much. You've been a huge blessing to me. God bless you."}

You know, other churches, other Christian groups, you know, well, they, they're devoid of the Holy Spirit, you know, that kind of thing.

I've been thinking about the resurrection of the body, the life of the world to come, new heavens and new earth, and what is it going to be like? And the idea I keep coming back to is what if one of the outcomes of theosis is that God then sends us out to spread life throughout the rest of the universe, but without the risk of us taking sin and evil with us, totally in conformant with his will. And maybe we're each curate our own planet and can travel to. To visit one another instantaneously, the way the resurrected body of Christ was able to travel after. After, after the resurrection. And so anyways, I guess my question is I find this idea very motivating and is it in conformity with the church teaching?

Well, the story goes on, but you're not the one telling it. And Tolkien comes down on. Yeah, in the life of the age to come. We're gonna be writing poetry and music and sculpture and the whole nine yards. It's gonna be, you know, a sub creative smorgasbord. So unsurprising because Lewis was much more the Platonist, I think, than Tokyo was. But. Yeah, I don't know. I mean, you know, Steve talks about creating planets. I don't. That might be a little bit too much. But there is definitely this sense of the age to come being stewarded by the saints. Right. I mean, that's, that's, that's in scripture. I don't know. This, this kind of jumps off in some ways a little bit. In one of the other directions from, from my initial question at the beginning about your, your, your Nietzsche talk. What do you think?

I was reading a paper by Margaret Barker on the temple roots of the liturgy. In that paper, she makes the argument that the day of atonement was a cleansing of creation, that the temple represents kind of a microcosm of creation. And so the Day of atonement wasn't just a cleansing of the temple so that God could remain present among his people, but that it was kind of symbolically cleansing of the entire creation. And I'm thinking of some of the things that have been said on Lord of Spirits regarding Christ and his blood shed on the cross and what it means to make atonement. And I guess I'm just wondering if there's anything to what she's saying. And. Yeah. Curious to get your thoughts. Thank you."}

There has to be a wilderness to which the goat for Azazel is sent out."}

There's an outside of the camp. Right. Elements of the offerings are burnt outside of the camp. So there has to be. For that ritual to function, there has to be an outside of the camp. And so that ritual functioned only to cleanse the sanctuary, and then by extension of the sanctuary, the camp. But the part she has picked up on there is that the ritual as described in Leviticus 16 is pointing to. And Second Temple Judaism understood this all over the place. In Second Temple Judaism, like in Second Enoch and the Apocalypse of Abraham, there is this idea that there's going to be an eschatological day of atonement, that this ritual by the tabernacle being a sort of microcosm, is pointing to that day on which all of creation will be purified and cleansed. And there will be no, everything will be sanctuary. Right? Because remember Genesis 1, the creation is created as a temple, right? So the whole temple of creation will be sort of reconsecrated, purified and reconsecrated to God. And you then find places in the New Testament, like 1 John 2:2, where the apostles are arguing that Christ's blood has done that in potency and will do that in its fullness at his return.

When we worship Christ, we worship the Father because the honor passes from Christ to the image, the image to the prototype of the invisible Father.

We're talking about veneration and people. We're talking about, you give everyone the honor and respect that they are due. Right. And the image of something is due, the same or person is due the same respect and honor that that person or thing is due. Then separately, when we're talking about the doctrine of the Holy Trinity, one of the ways we point out that we only worship one God. Right.

Stubborn Love by Rita Thola is one book in three parts written for young people. Her Life tells the story of Mother Maria Skopstova of Paris from birth to death. The first section of the book is accompanied by graphic novel style illustrations to help the young reader imagine her work, family and adventures. Her writings comes next, a smattering of some of the notes and thoughts that shaped her. Your life is the final section where the reader is challenged to consider his or her place in the world, using Mother Maria's life and sayings as a springboard for.

If Gentile Christians are considered those who are living in the land and not Israelites, why does Paul go to all the trouble to show that we are grafted in as the lost tribe of Israel? And if we are actually Israelites now, isn't it trying to have it both ways to say that we are not subject to the laws that apply to Israelites? Stated another way, James agreed with Paul that gentiles were not subject to the Torah applicable to Israel. Would James agree that the gentiles have been grafted into Israel? And if so, would he have changed his mind about which laws they are subject to? If you got circumcised and ate the Passover, you would then be an Israelite and thus have to keep the whole Torah. Correct. If our baptism is analogous to circumcision and by it we enter into Israel, then why would we still be considered only living in the land?"}

So part of what St. Paul is doing there, as we went through kind of some detail last time, is God let all these branches grow that he knew were going to end up being cut off. And part of the reason for that was to have the place to graft in these other branches who he knew would come and would be faithful and right. And that makes them part of God's people, Israel. But that does not make them Jewish, for lack of a better term. Right. So they are Greeks who are now part of Israel. And that means the hard work has to be done of what is Greek Christian identity."}

And I've. I've done this. I've never grafted a branch. I do not have that level of arborist skill, but I have bought and planted and successfully. Well, relatively successfully tended a bunch of fruit trees. If you come to my backyard, there. There are six fruit trees in my backyard, and which I. All planted. But if you take a look, close look, almost every especially apple tree that you buy, it has been grafted. Almost all of them. And that's because if you grow these things from seed, you don't necessarily get the best fruit. The best ones come through grafting. That's just a characteristic of apple trees. And so, yeah, you can see it. If you look closely, you can actually see that they've been grafted. In most cases, I would say. I don't know about other fruit trees, but definitely apples are that way. But yeah, you. So. But yeah, you. Theoretically. And you can buy. You can buy multi graph. You know, trees that have graphs from multiple origins. And so you can have single tree that grows. It won't be like, you know, you couldn't get a tree that. I don't think that grows oranges and apples and pears and cherries. You know, I don't think you can do that. It'll be more like multiple kinds of apples, you know, that sort of thing. Because I think that tree would probably reject something that's radically different. Although, I mean, I. I think you can get a citrus that will grow like limes and lemons and oranges maybe. But. But yeah, yeah. So, I mean, I, I, I think it's, it's, you know, to understand grafting a little bit better, I think gives some better understanding to what's going on with this. And I would say, I mean, look at the church. It's clear that there are different ways that different kinds of orthodox Christianity that each have their own sort of flavor. Right. Different emphases within those traditions. That strikes me as indicating that the church is a tree with multiple graphs on it from different varieties."}

It was super graphic in displaying Christ's suffering and crucifixion and what crucifixion was like, how sort of graphically violent it was. And the argument was, well, look, the Gospels don't spend a lot of time going over the gruesome details. And so that shouldn't be our focus. Right. And that seems on the face, like a fair argument until you think for a second and say the people who originally read this had seen crucifixions. They had seen everything Mel Gibson put on screen in front of them. Yeah, right. They had witnessed this multiple times. And so the Gospel writers didn't have to go into all that gory detail. Right. Because the people they arrived to knew all the gory detail of what that meant. Right. And in some of these cases, people say, well, the church fathers don't go into all that context. It's like, yeah, because they were still living in the Roman Empire. They didn't have to. Right. Like there were still people doing grafts in olive trees when St. John Chrysostom was preaching."}

I remember listening to your Halloween special a couple of years ago, and I noted that in all of the monsters and creatures that you touched on, mermaids were not one of them. So I'm curious to know what exactly they are. And the second question is, I'm an iconographer, and in all of my research of iconography, I have discovered icons that startled me. Icons done in a kind of anime manga style. So as an Orthodox priest, if someone were to bring you an icon of the Theotoko service saint that was done in a style not according to what we normally see, you know, something kind of Disney Pixar related, for example, and asked you to bless that. What would you say and why? What would the standard be for? This is an icon versus this is not an icon. Thanks so much."}

The Psalms of David. You got to remember that what we now call the Book of Psalms, the Psalter, is made up of five books. They're labeled in the text, meaning there were five separate collections of psalms that circulated independently before they were all put together into the Book of Psalms as we know it today.

So the language we try to use in terms of the relationship between God and the nations post Babel is like, I wouldn't use that divorced language or abandoned or any kind of language like that. The language we use is he had to distance himself in the way that he had to distance himself. And this is the parallel we draw all the time. He had to distance himself from Judah. He had to leave the temple when Judah became wicked. And that's when the exile happens. Because if God's holiness remains in the presence of sin, then that's where you get death by holiness that would consume. And so you get the story of the flood in Genesis where man becomes unbelievably wicked, God remains present with him and humanity is wiped out. God promises he's not going to do that again. So then what you see in Genesis chapter 10 after the flood is that though the same thing all starts happening again, has happened before the flood. You get giants, you get nimrod, you get all the bad stuff. Right. It's all happening again. Well, God has promised not to destroy the world this time. So what's the only other thing he can do? He can withdraw."}

Ever since listening to one of the early episodes where you mentioned the virtues, I've begun to see some verses of scripture differently. And also I think in one of the episodes, you mentioned how we invite the saints and angels to worship with us when we say certain verses from the Psalms. So my question is dealing with inanimate matter, for lack of a better term. I always wondered how people of the day would have interpreted what Jesus said in Luke 19:40, where he says that if the disciples that were praising him were silent, the stones would cry out. And in the Psalms, for example, Psalm 95, 96, 97, and 99, Psalm 97 is even very explicit in saying, the rivers shall clap their hands together. The mountains shall rejoice at the presence of the Lord. Before listening to Lord of spirits, I would have interpreted these passages as anthropomorphisms or metaphors. But now, after listening to Lord of spirits, I feel like there's something more here. So in these passages, are Jesus and the psalms referring to the virtues? Thank you for all that you do."}

And so the context of my question is that I was saved a couple years ago from the occult. And one of the gifts that the Lord used to save me was discernment of spirits. And most recently at a church service, as we were all receiving communion together, in my knowledge of the unrepentance of one church member, it felt like we were partaking, like there was poison in the communion. And I don't want to say that, you know, the devil is more powerful than he is, but I'm just wondering if there is any backing to that sense that I believe I was receiving. So. Thank you so much."}

That unrepentant sin within the church community is harmful to the community. If it's not dealt with. With regards to whether someone's sin can harm the Eucharist, I definitely disagree that that is the case.

No, not think you know, but no, no. Right. That this person is living in unrepentant sin, you can approach them as a brother or sister in Christ to try to talk to them about. Sounds like. I'm guessing the caller is not in an orthodox church. Maybe she didn't say another kind of Christian communion. Like I said, it just sounds like. Because she didn't say. And so. But the reason I bring that up is authority structures are different. Right. In an orthodox parish, it is the priest's job to protect the Eucharist. And by that we mean in some cases, as we were talking about with God and the nations. Protect people from the Eucharist."}

This is prayer of Saint Ephrem the Syrian that we say over and over again and let you know, help me to know my own sins and not to judge my brother. Right. Eyes on your own plate. That gets stickier. Obviously, in other that's handled differently in Roman Catholic churches, as we alluded to earlier, they have a little different view of reception of the Eucharist with the Eucharist working ex opera operatum in Protestant churches. Frankly, Protestant churches are all over the map about what the Eucharist even is and what it does and how often to do it and all of that. So you can't make a generalization there of how to approach that. But I mean, if it's something you know about and you're concerned for your brother and sister in Christ, it's perfectly all right to approach them and say, hey, have you talked to the priest or pastor about this? Are you doing something about this? Is there a way I can help you work through this? Not that you're judging them and saying they're unworthy to be in the church or unworthy to receive the Eucharist or something, but just to talk to them and offer them support and help. The New Testament has promises for those who help bring a wandering brother or sister back to Christ."}
