And he will be the light of the nations and the hope of those whose hearts are troubled. All who dwell on the earth will fall down and worship him. And they will praise and bless and celebrate with song the lord of spirits. First Enoch, chapter 48, verses 4 through 5. The modern world doesn't acknowledge, but is nevertheless haunted by spirits and angels, demons and saints. In our time, many yearn to break free of the prison of a flat secular materialism, to see and to know reality as it truly is. What is this spiritual reality like? How do we engage with it? Well, how do we permeate everyday life with spiritual presence? Orthodox Christian priests Father Andrew Stephen Damick and Fr. Stephen DeYoung host this live call in show focused on enchantment in creation, the union of the seen and unseen as made by God and experienced by mankind throughout history. Welcome to the Lord of Spirits."}

So regarding the dead, prior to the heroine, I understand that everybody who died went to Hades, but the righteous dead had it a little bit easier in Abraham's bosom.

There is an element of over linearity there. Right. But we can say more than that in that. So the picture that we're getting, for example, the way it's laid out in. In the Book of Enoch, in first Enoch, when it describes the different caves, remember there's the cave with Abel, right. Who of course predates Abraham. So there were those kind of sources that describe Hades in that way, acknowledge that there were righteous dead before Abraham. But I think the reason that it becomes known as Abraham's bosom is that Abraham then becomes the father of all of the subsequent faithful. And so they have Abraham as their father. And when you read like the patriarchal narratives in Genesis and then even going forward in the Hebrew scriptures, it'll talk about when they bury someone, it'll say they rested with their fathers, right? And their fathers after those generations become Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. Right. And so Abraham sort of becomes paradigmatic of the righteous dead, but that doesn't mean that he was the first one."}

And I knew that the cave. The caves from the Book of Enoch as well, but I'm just wondering because that's how they referred if there was any kind of like, change in there.

So the first verse of Galatians in chapter three, when Paul says, he talks about how, what does he say? Before his eyes, Jesus Christ was clearly portrayed among you. Crucified. I've always been curious about that language that he uses portrayed. And just the iconography thing is very, very new to me. Is, is that maybe a reference to. To icons in. In the church that early, or is he just saying, I told you about this?"}

So what it says for everybody who's not sure what Lisa's talking about, this is Galatians, chapter three, verse one, where St. Paul writes, oh, foolish Galatians, who has bewitched you? It was before your eyes that Jesus Christ was publicly portrayed as crucified. So clearly the issue would be like, wait a minute, were the Galatians at the crucifixion? Answer. Right. No, they were. They were not present. I mean, this is sometime later, right? So. So you're asking, does this. Is this a reference to iconography? Is that what you're saying?"}

This is the biggest part that most people miss in this argument is they don't understand what pagan homes looked like, and they don't understand the existence of pagan iconography in our. In our episodes on iconography and idolatry. That's why we structured them the way we did. Because if you just think like, well, pagans had idols and Christians have these things and they call them icons. What's the difference? Right. It's very different when you understand that. No, like, they had pagan iconography on their walls. They didn't worship it. Right. Like they went to the pagan temple to worship, but they had these scenes from these pagan stories and pagan myths that were reenacted ritually at the temples. They had them all over their walls in their homes, some of them extremely violent or extremely sexually graphic or both."}

You know, I. My experience has been in thinking about these references to, like, in this verse that may well be about imagery. And I was just. I just saw this again the other day. You know, like, there's a whole. There's a whole world of people ridiculing the idea that there's any difference between veneration and worship. Right. They'll use those, you know, ridicule caps or whatever, whatever you call that, mockery caps, as though, you know, veneration is just sort of milder form of worship. But I think the. One of the big problems is that people don't understand what exactly constitutes worship, and that is that it's about putting sacrifices in front of the one you're worshiping. And so, I don't know it. Once you understand that, like, what worship really is in the ancient world, a lot of this other stuff kind of falls into place and makes a whole lot more sense. You know, that kissing or saluting or bowing or whatever, those things are not worship. And I mean, there's a lot of stuff that it's kind of buried under translation problems, but that's why I always say, look at the actual actions being done. You know, it's all about the actions. So.

So the Israelites, they had as priests at the beginning, the elders of their clans and tribes, or in the Roman religion, the emperor was the great priest, the high priest, but he was also the father of his people.

So part of it is that there's a lot of equivocation on the word priest. So like Emilian mentioned, like the lector priests in Egypt or whether they had a kind of fatherhood and they were a fundamentally different kind of priest than Pharaoh was. Right. So when we've talked about the kind of priesthood that's connected to fatherhood, it's the kind of priesthood that means representing the people under your authority to God and God to the people under your authority. Whereas what we call the lector priests or the magicians in the Torah. Right. The lucer Pharaoh were really the reason they're called lecter priests is they were literate, they knew how to read. And so their job was to sort of keep ancient, sacred, esoteric information to be able to supply that information to Pharaoh to allow Pharaoh to fulfill his function. And you see a similar kind of thing, the priests of Jupiter in Rome who took care of the Sibylline books is a similar kind of thing. Right. Emperor is the Pontifex Maximus. But they're there, they keep those books and use those books to advise him, to allow him to carry out that office. Priesthood in Rome, though, in general, like the broader sense of priesthood, not that particular sense of priesthood of those particular priests who kept the books. Right. Was enmeshed with the idea of authority. And all authority in Roman culture was really seen in terms of the paterfamilias. So that was sort of especially true in Rome."}

Right. You started out by gaining certain priesthoods. Right. So that was part of the authority structure. Now, in terms of when you go to, as Father Andrew mentioned, if you're talking about less developed cultures, if you're talking about nomadic cultures, that very much it is the patriarch of sort of the larger extended household who was serving in the priestly functions, like we see with the Midianites, with the Israelites before Sinai, before there was a special priesthood that we've talked about on the show that you see with the Moabites, etc. But the king is at sort of the top of that Sumeria. You have priest kings. It seems pretty clear in the early stages of Indian civilization that it was the leaders, the. Who were also the priests, that there wasn't sort of a kingly kind of leadership and then a separate priesthood. Right. That those things were commingled also in the Indus River Valley in the early stages. And of course, Hinduism has developed into a whole bunch of different things. Hinduism isn't really one religion."}

And so, like, I'm not. I'm not a super expert like in early levels of Chinese and Japanese culture, but based on all of the earlier cultures I know about, I would imagine the same thing would be true. That if there is later a separate priesthood that develops, it was probably specialized like the lector priests, and it probably broke off from figures originally holding both a. Because."}

But okay, that's in our Christian situation, that's in the Jewish situation. Move yourself for the sake of thought experiment into a polytheistic situation. Right. So priesthood still being that in a polytheistic situation, takes on this other piece where the ruler, the leader is himself divine in some sense. And so it is generally not a question of that leader being a representative of some God or the priest of some God. Like in a Dungeons and Dragons sense, he's a cleric of this. Right. But of the. The king, the ruler, the leader being a member of the council of gods in this polytheistic situation, yeah, he's one of the gods. He's one of the gods himself. And so he represents. When he. Instead of representing the people before God in prayer, the way we would think of it, right? It's him representing the people in the council of the gods, right. And instead of him representing the. Representing a particular God to the people, it's him representing the council of the gods, the divine as a whole. Right to the people."}

So you've always said that the repentance is not just feeling sorry about what you've done, but about action and restoration. So in his case, was he received in, in paradise as a one time offer or how exactly did he receive salvation? Yeah, because he didn't have time for anything more than testifying that Christ is the Son of God."}

And Dismas is one of the robbers and sees the baby Jesus and says, leave them alone. Right. And it kind of makes you wonder, was this tradition an attempt to represent some kind of repentance that God would have worked with as a result? I tend to think so. I'm not saying I disbelieve or to me the question is not did that really happen? That doesn't kind of matter that much. But also like repentance is not only like, for instance, if someone is on their deathbed, right, and they have a genuine conversion experience, like, you know, oh my, I've lived a horrible life, God forgive me, right. That is an act of repentance to ask for forgiveness. And so when Dismas asks the Lord, remember me when you come into your, in your kingdom, when you come in your kingdom, that is an act of repentance to pray to God to have mercy on him. You know, saying Lord, have mercy is an act of repentance on all of our parts. So I mean, I, you know, you don't have to accept this extra canonical tradition about Saint Ismas, although I find it really interesting and I really rather like it actually. I think it provides a kind of interesting sort of poetic frame to his life. But the fact that he says, remember me when you come in your kingdom, that is a repentant act. Right? So I don't know. Father, do you have anything you wanted to add or subtract."}

Yeah, it's. So there's a little bit of subtext that is not explicit in Genesis 4, but is in pretty much almost every other tale in the ancient world about the rise of technology. Right. Which is that this kind of knowledge comes to mankind through the visitation of spirits. And you know, in the pagan context, that's depicted as being very good. Right. So like, think about Greek paganism. You've got Prometheus, he comes along, he gives mankind fire. And of course, he also brings Pandora's box and all kinds of other fun stuff like that jar."}

You know that he brings technology is a gift of the gods, literally. Right. Whereas the rise of technology in Genesis 4 is associated with the line of Cain, which should strongly suggest to you that this is a problematic context in which technology arises. And so the implication there is. Well, we kind of all know that technology comes from visitation from spirits, and that's not good. Spirits giving knowledge to mankind is not a good thing. They don't have our best interests at heart. And so like, if you think about the list of things that's, that's given there in Genesis 4, right, you've got not just living in tents. So there's, there's the rise of music, there's the rise of metallurgy, there's the rise of keeping of livestock. All these things which are kind of basic to what we think of as civilization. And it's not that those actions are evil, those technologies are evil in themselves. Right. It's rather that mankind is not ready for that. And so he's going to tend to misuse it. And I mean, metallurgy is probably the obvious one because it has to do with weapons. First off, keeping livestock, maybe not as obvious, but if you think about that as the pooling of resources. Right. It's the hoarding of food, frankly. And then music is often associated. You can see this in St. Irenaeus. The rise of music is often associated with sorcery and seduction and that kind of thing. Right. So these are all about, you know, controlling other people and getting your will over other people, disadvantaging other people for your own advantage if you misuse those things. And since it's the line of Cain, the very strong implication is that they're being misused. Right. There's no talk in there about. And this was to the benefit of mankind and everything was good. No, this is Cain's line, Lamech, the murderer, all this kind of stuff. Right. So that's the context. It's not explicit in the biblical text that this knowledge comes through the visitation of spirits. But that is the way that that story goes in the ancient near east. And the Bible is essentially commenting on that story. That's my understanding of it, anyway. Is there anything else, Father, that needs to be mentioned?"}

Right. And then the tree just sort of offers its fruit in its season to growing food, where you're having to work and toil and grow food out of the ground. And then of course, you're killing the plants and eating them. And then humanity moves to. He's finally given permission after the flood to eat animals. But that's where all the prohibitions against blood eating and drinking blood come in. Because it's this idea that humanity should not go all the way into becoming a predator. So they were herding and eating animals before they had permission to. Right. And so the idea is about humans becoming. Becoming predators. So this is about the sort of descent of humanity in. In Kane's line. And again, like Father Andrew said, it's not that the technology is bad, it's just that this technology gets revealed to humans before they're ready for it, which is the same dynamic that happens. Right. There's nothing evil about the tree of Knowledge of good and evil. Right. The tree is not evil. God made it. It's that humanity was not ready for that knowledge, was not ready to eat from that tree, and they jumped ahead and took it. Right. And so when humanity receives something they're not ready for, we can see this over and over again in human history. The first use to which humans put new technology is pretty much always evil."}

I mean, I can't quote anybody offhand myself, but it is my understanding, at least some of the fathers do suggest that the Incarnation would have happened even if there had not been sin. But I think one of the problems, of course, is that we don't. We don't live in a reality in which that didn't happen. We have this reality. Right. So then the question would be. The question I would have would be like, what would be the implication of trying to figure out what would have happened even if there had not been sin? And I mean, to me, the creation by itself, the very fact of creation, that there is the uncreated God who out of love creates everything, out of. Out of. From nothing, from nothingness, which means that there's the uncreated God and then the created creation, including mankind, that God and his love for mankind is going to become man so as to bring about that union between God and man. And that what sin does, is. Makes it so that there needs to be forgiveness and healing and so forth in order for that to come about. But that, that was all that, the incarnation, that Christ was always, in a sense, the end point of creation. He was always the purpose. That Christ is. Is, in a sense, I don't want to say baked into that seems a little irreverent, but that's the best I've got. That the Incarnation is baked into the creation from the beginning, that creation implies the Incarnation. I don't know. Am I being an accidental heretic on anything? Father Stephen, Try not."}

Right. And I think that's an important point to make because. And I'm going to be fair here, right? I'm going to be as fair as I can here. If you delve into even most Protestant traditions, they will talk about that. They will say that the, the Incarnation, Christ, redemption of Christ does more than just deal with sin, right? But if you ask the average just American Christian, why did God become man in the person of Jesus Christ? What was the purpose of his life, Death, resurrection? They will say it was to deal with sin because that's how it's sort of been presented, right? Four spiritual laws. There's this, you've got this problem. God loves you, has this wonderful plan for your life, but there's a problem. He can't do it because you're a sinner, but he did this to take care of your sin, right? And so, but, but so sort of posing that draws us to these other things. And as, as Father Andrew was pointing to, right. In the person of Jesus Christ, God Unites himself within the person of Jesus Christ with our shared humanity. And by uniting himself with us and our shared humanity, he unites himself to the entire created order, the entire cosmos. Because it's. Saint Maximus talks about this a lot. Because in humanity the whole cosmos is summed up right in the one being. Because all of creation is created according to the Logos, who is Jesus Christ, who is human."}

Right. Because sin came into the world, it has to be dealt with. But this is why part of the problem with seeing the purpose of Christ as, and his incarnation is, is just dealing with sin is it kind of frames it almost as if it was like plan B. Yeah. Like God had this one plan, but then, oh no, like humans are sinful now, so now he comes up with plan B to try to fix it. Right. And when we understand the full scope of what's going on in Christ's incarnation, then you see, like sin is a low grade speed bump, right. On the way to God fulfilling his plan. It doesn't frustrate him or stop him at all. Right. Our worst sins, our worst rebellion. Right. And, and part of the reason why I think some of the other views are popular is our pride, right. Like we like to think, you know, like, ah, I'm a sinner. I've done these horrible things. I've, you know, flown in the face of God. Take that God. And he who sits in the heavens laughs, you know, at the raging of the nations and their nonsense. Right. Like I'm, I'm kind of pathetic, right.

Intriguing to me. We read about the line, like men of Moab the lion like men. And whenever you like, whenever you go read that, the word lion like men in the original language. I can't remember where that was the term Hebrew or Greek. I think it was Hebrew. It translates to like God, like men. And to me, that kind of relates Back to Genesis 6 to some degree, where perhaps these people were doing ceremonies, rituals, drunkenness, to create this possession of a demon within them, to give them the strength of a God. Is that kind of the take on it? Or what do we look at when we see the line like men of Moab and their incredible strength and demeanor and everything?"}

Ammon kind of gets short shrift in the Hebrew Bible, but Edom and Moab in particular have this kind of arc because, of course, their descendants or connected to Abraham, right? Moab through Lot, Edom through Esau. Right. And when the Israelites are first coming into the land in Deuteronomy. Deuteronomy chapter two, if I'm remembering right, is when they come to Edom and God says they're not to take a foot of land from the Edomites because they're like their cousins. And because God brought the Edomites to that land and gave them that land and drove out the giant clans who were there in front of the. And then says the same thing about the Moabites, Right? And so at that point, right. God says, hey, Israel, I'm bringing you to this other piece of land. I'm going to drive out the giant clans there before you."}

You know, it's interesting in looking up, like, this verse in what is this? 2nd Samuel, like, the word that's there is that describes these. It gets translated. Second sample, 2320. It gets translated in various ways, like, like lion, like men, valiant men.

As long as I'm not late for dinner. So my question, I guess I got a little bit of a way to describe it is it's the onion of pride. Right. So what do I mean by that? You know, when I converted and on my journey, I, you know, became aware of pride, right? It's talked about everywhere. Pride is one of the. One of the great things we need to shed ourselves up. But what I've noticed is that after I, you know, recognize that top level, right? The complete convert, not knowing anything about anything, you know, when you start to see that, it's like, oh, you take notice of it. You kind of get rid of that, work on yourself, and the next thing you know, you're starting to question everything. Is this a prideful thought? Am I thinking about this in the wrong way? What's the consequences? You know, for example, you know, I was brought up that, you know, to say, you know, have pride in the job well done, right? But, you know, then at the same time you say, give glory to God. So, you know, what is a healthy way to look at this to the extent without driving yourself crazy about every, you know, you know, basically the motivation behind any action, right. Is it. Is it a prideful motivation or is it a selfless motivation? You know, I'm not probably doing a very good job explaining this because I'm still kind of just struggling with it myself internally. But, you know, it just seems like it can be, you know, every time you peel a layer back, you find another one, or potentially you find another one. Yeah, I'll take my. Take your answer."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #099 - 2024-08-29 - Pantheon and Pandemonium XII - Live Q&A Aug 2024","start":5297.6,"end":5652.52,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"I remember one time I had a conversation. This was a number of years ago, I had a conversation with a friend, friend of mine who's a monk. And I can't even remember how we got into the conversation, but there was. It wasn't confession. We were just talking and walking or something like that. And I said something about, you know, I'm full of pride or whatever. And he looks at me and goes, pride? I said, yeah, pride, he says. He said, pride is an old man's sin. And I remember being kind of struck by that. And he said, next thing he said was, you probably have vanity. Now, he didn't mean any of that literally, like, oh, there's no way you have pride. You have to reach a certain age. You know, that's not what he meant, right? But rather that, you know, from. From his point of view, pride is like, you said, like, there's sort of like layers of an onion. Pride, of course, as the, the Church Fathers tell us and as the scripture says, is the basis for all other sins. Right. So what exactly is pride? Pride is me first. That's what it is at its real base is it's about me, you know, and the and. And I think what. What the monk meant by that's an old man's sin is that usually it's not until we're older that we really realize that that's what we're doing. We're not ready to admit to ourselves or anyone else that way, deep down, we actually think me first. Because it's. Because in our culture at least, it still seems to be suggested that that's actually bad to just say me first, me first. Even though there's all kinds of things that are teaching us that that's the way we should go, but we don't come out and say it because we're not pagans, and pagans would have no problem with that ethic. We at least have a Christian veneer of culture that you should at least pretend to be humble, right? And usually it's not until we're older that we actually realize, you know, way deep down, I actually prefer myself over everyone else. And usually, you know, when we're younger, it's vanity, which is, you know, not so much me first as look at me, look at me, right? It has the same basis. It's the same basis in pride. But often we don't see that root. We have to deal with the other things too. Like, I mean, think about the other kinds of sins. Vanity definitely comes from pride, gluttony. Like, why is it that we're gluttonous? It's because we're afraid that we won't get to be first way deep down. And so since I'm afraid of death, I'm afraid of, you know, lack of satisfaction, I'm going to eat. Same thing with lust, but in a different way, right? Like envy, you know, all of these things. Right now, wanting to do something. Well, we in English do use the word pride to refer to that, but I don't think that that is the same thing, even though we're using the same word for it. Like, if I say to my. One of my children, hey, I'm really proud of you, I'm not saying, hey, I'm really me first about you, right? That's not what that means at all. It's that I feel good things. I recognize your virtue. I appreciate it. I'm happy. You know that's what that means, right? I desire what is good for you. So I think even though we use that word pride in English to refer to that same thing, I don't think it's this to refer to that. I don't think it's the same thing as pride in the sinful sense. Now someone could have pride in the sinful sense about a job well done or about one of their children or whatever. But you know, if one of your children excels and you have a good feeling and you tell them that you are proud of them, that's not the same thing. That's not the same thing, Right. So I, I think, you know, there's a lot of wisdom, especially for those who are beginners. And even, you know, I've been orthodox for a few decades now, I still would describe myself in terms of spiritual life as a beginner. There's a lot of wisdom in the beginning virtues, which is control your mouth, control your stomach. Right? Like let's start there. Control your stomach, control your mouth. And then when you get those things under control, then, you know, you start to learn. Okay, there's other things I need to work on as well. Right. Control your appetite, control your desires, you know, get yourself under control. And, and gradually as a onion, we peel down and eventually, God willing, we can actually really repent in some deep, powerful way. But even if all we, you know, even if we're just still beginners, God will look upon that effort and he'll. He'll be merciful. Thank God, because I'm still, as I said, I'm still working on those basic things. You know, I think most of us are, right, working on those basic things like control your stomach, control your mouth. That's why I tell people, is that that's the place to start. Like just start by being quiet and by not eating as much and that'll take you a long way. I don't know, Father, what else you got?"}

Hobbes, what I'm specifically referring to said that there are two springs of human action. This is one of his basic ethical principles. There are self motivated actions and there are other motivated actions. Actions and self motivated actions are always bad and other motivated actions are always good. And because we've got that bred into us in sort of the modern liberal ethic, right, Liberalism, broadly understood. Right. We tend to go into this and hyper analysis of everything we do and our motives and was this too tainted by sin?

So I know that y' all have spoken at length about ancient near east cosmology, Jewish astrology, and various episodes, most recently the Testament, the twelve Patriarchs, and Father Stevens whole Council of God podcast recently going through Genesis. One of the things I keep thinking about is how the association of the angels with the stars and the planets or celestial bodies, like how that keeps coming up throughout scripture and through many of the episodes. What I'm trying to. Or why I just kind of want y' all discuss out a little bit, is how to better conceptually hold ancient cosmology with modern astronomy. I know the ancient world didn't have specificity to the material makeup of the planets or stars or astrophysics or anything like that. And I know that we've talked about, like how, you know, for example, Mount Olympus, you know, they could climb up to the top of the peak and see that nothing was there, yet there was still a spiritual significance that the Greeks held for that being place or the abode of the gods. So quite simply, my question is, is how should we think about the association of stars and the planets with angels in light of recent astronomy? Are angels and fallen angels still associated with them? Is it similar to how the ancient view of lower G gods being associated with territories or peoples? I just want to know what y' all think about that."}

But they also have even, even used, used math to figure out and they guessed pretty close to what its actual circumference was. You know, so that was figured out 2,300 years ago at least, and even by like then the 8th century AD. And I'm mentioning that because this is when St. John of Damascus is writing. He's using this three level, quote unquote, flat earth cosmology in his exact exposition of the orthodox faith. Right. And so you might ask yourself like, okay, I mean, you know, if you buy into the ridiculous things that some anti Christian apologists say about quote unquote religion, then of course you'll explain that by saying, look how stupid these religious people still are.

Right. You know, ancient pagan mathematicians are pagans worshiping their gods. Right. Like so, so again, like this idea that it's like, you know, that's just, just total ignorance to say that. But what you will see is that while it's fully understood that the world is round by at least the intellectual world and Greco Roman world, at the same time you have this multi level cosmology being used. Right. And so, so why, why would they do that? Well, it's because these are different ways of looking at the creation that are describing it in different ways for different purposes. Right. And they're on one level they're incompatible. Right. That you can't say that heaven is above that the earth is where we're standing and the underworld is underneath us and literalize that. And also, you know, describe the cosmology that you find in a science textbook of the 21st century. Right. Like those things are not compatible on the literal level. Just, it doesn't work. Right.

For early church history, my recommendation, I mean, so Metropolitan Callistus Ware, writing under his original name of Timothy Ware, his Book the Orthodox Church has a good sort of outline, general outline of Orthodox Church history. History, that's a good starting place if you have no knowledge of that at all. My suggestion is to especially look at primary sources as much as you can or read stuff that's directly engaging with primary sources. Right. So like Eusebius's church history is good for looking at the early years of the Church. I definitely recommend reading the apostolic collection that's called the Apostolic Fathers, which has like, like the writings of Saint Ignatius of Antioch and some of those from that are basically all like late first, early second, early mid second century texts. Saint Justin Martyr is great, Saint Irenaeus of Lyon, a lot of those early Church Fathers can give you a sense of what's going on. If you're looking for secondary sources, I mean a lot of the standard names like, like Chadwick, he's a good solid historian. JND Kelly, you know, Yaroslav Pelikan for sure, definitely Yaroslav Pelikan. And you know, a lot of these guys have written piles and piles of stuff. They're all good, solid historians writing about church history. So those are my suggestions there. Like one of the great benefits of like Pelikan for instance is he's, you know, the citations of the sources he's looking at, looking at are incredibly extensive. So you can sit there and read what he's reading, which is really the place to go ultimately, you know, look at the actual sources themselves if you're able to. I mean a lot of people are not able to or they don't want to and that's cool if you just want to read some secondary source, but just be aware that whatever secondary source person writing is, that's their take on the material. But a lot of these well regarded standard scholars are going to give you a good fair treatment, just kind of look up what their deal is, where they're coming from so you can at least see the angle. Father, you know way more about ancient, ancient history than I do and what you read there."}

Or ended. Collapsed, something like that. But it's called 1177 Eric Klein. It's about the Bronze Age collapse. And so he does a pretty good job of summarizing sort of the Bronze Age and the level of civilization in the Bronze Age and then the different factors that led to collapsing. And he recently published a sequel called after 1177, where he talks about the survival of the cultures like Egypt that managed to survive the Bronze Age collapse and then the new cultures that developed in the early Iron Age. Right. Like, coming out of that. Beyond that, like I said, it's really. You're gonna be looking at good books about individual. Individual cultures. Right. So, like, there are books on Egypt. There are books on, you know, the Babylonian empire. There are books on that go more in depth in those. But Eric Klein has a pretty good. If you start there, Eric Klein, in the first book has a pretty good bibliography and stuff. So you can get a lot of those books on those particular civilizations from there."}

Is sort of then instrumental as, you know, the bishop of Crete. And so I think that tradition was probably aimed at. Right. So the.

And I'm trying to, like, really get into prayer more in an orthodox mindset, but it's not at all, you know, what I was used to as a Protestant, you know, like, praying for. I don't know, it's just. It's completely different the way that the east prays. And so my priest said something to me, which was he suggested we get an icon corner because we pray, like Orthodox. And I am kind of like, I pray from a prayer book. Like, I'm. I feel like I don't. I don't know how to authentically pray. And so my question is, is it just like, you know, when it comes to loving your neighbor or fake it till you make it thing, or am I looking at prayer in the wrong way? Is it. Is it wrong to. When I have a List of things that I pray. I go through my prayer book and find a specific prayer that helps with those things."}

The thought that immediately came to me first was a. I don't know if it was an article or it was like a transcription of a talk or something like that. From. There's a modern holy elder named Elder Emilianos, who was the abbot of Simonopetra Monastery in Mount Athos. He died just two or three years ago, as I recall. And my own father confessor, actually Father Emilianos, was his spiritual father for a while. Anyway, in this article, he talks about. He uses two different Greek words to talk about prayer. And this is, again, as with so many things, this is just one way of talking about it, right? This is not the way. And so he talks about the word. The Greek words that he uses uses pros, fk, and fk, which, as you can hear, are related to each other. So prosef Key. I'm not going to pull the etymological fallacy, but basically, that's the kind of prayer where you ask for something, okay. Whether it's, you know, mercy or health or healing or, you know, whatever it might be. And then FHI is this sort of idea of abiding in God, okay? And both are prayer, but he clearly says that the latter is deeper or higher, depending on how you want to think about it, but greater. Right. And is usually not attainable at first. Okay? So the beginning of the life of prayer is to ask God for things, and we ask him for good things. I mean, this is in keeping with the scriptures you don't have, because you don't ask. Ask in my name. Right? This sense of asking. And at least in terms of the actual text of our liturgical prayers, the prayers that are in the prayer book, this is almost all aimed at that, right? Asking God for things. Yes, almost all of it is aimed at that. So clearly this is normal stuff. This is baseline. Like, this is what we should be doing. And especially since you're new and I don't know what your religious background before was, but evangelical, evangelical. So you're probably not used to using a prayer book. You're not used to standing in front of icons. You're not used to looking up a prayer for this thing or that thing, right? That's all relatively new to you. And actually, if you're interested in this kind of from an intellectual and historical point of view, there's a good book called Rituals of Spirit Spontaneity by Laurie Branch, who is a friend of mine. This was her doctoral Dissertation. And she tracked how historically it came to be within the English language world that being spontaneous became regarded as authentic religion, which was an innovation at the time."}

Yeah. So that is a historical development. Like it's only just a few hundred years ago that there came to be this widespread idea that spontaneous equals authentic. Right. And I get it. I mean, I'm from an evangelical background myself. Right. So I get it. But here's the thing. I think that'll help you bridge that gap. Okay. Love songs are way better if someone wrote them beforehand, refined them, practiced them and then delivered them, versus simply trying to spontaneously come up with something. Right. Like you might be able to spontaneously come up with something, something approaching poetry, but forget spontaneously coming up with something approaching a good love song. Like almost no one can do that. I'm sure there's people out there that can do that, but it's pretty rare. It takes work. Right. And so why would we think that prayer shouldn't take work of that kind? Right. I think we need to question the idea that spontaneity equals authenticity because it's not obvious from the historical point of view. Again, it's a development. And like I said, I recommend Dr. Branch's book Rituals of Spontaneity if you're interested in tracking that and taking it apart. I mean, it's an academic treatment, so that's the kind of book that it is. But it's good. It really shows how this is the case. But most of humanity, for most of history of any religion, has regarded pre written prayers as what constitutes the norms and authenticity of religion. And would it be inauthentic to read one of the Psalms as a prayer to God? It's in the scriptures, it's not inauthentic. That is the prayer book of ancient Israel, the Psalter, and it is continued to be the prayer book of the church. Right. And it's clear from looking at the Psalms, even if you're just reading in translation, that this has been worked over, meaning that David or whoever wrote the Psalm, worked on it and practiced it and edited was not mere spontaneity. It might have, it's possible, but not likely that it would have been spontaneous one time, but someone then wrote it down and then it was repeated and that wasn't spontaneous when it got repeated that first time. That's not spontaneous writing it down. That's not Spontaneous, you know, when Christ said, pray like this and then gave our Father who art. I mean, that's a formula. In fact, actually, that prayer, in many ways, the shape of that prayer forms the. The formulaic basis of a lot of the prayers of the church. So all of that is there. And I can tell you that number one, the quest for authenticity, I think, is what do you get out of that? Exactly? What are you going for there when you know that you've arrived? Aha. Now I am authentic. I think it's a problematic quest to begin with. But if the question is, what is real? Are you actually doing it? When you ask God for something, you're asking God for something. You know, the fact that you're reading the words of a saint in doing so doesn't mean you're not doing it. You are doing it. Right. Again, remember the love songs? The best love songs are definitely not spontaneous. Spontaneous love songs might well be hilarious, but probably not really good in terms of being truly a love song. Right. I mean, Song of Songs is incredibly deep, powerful. Poetry in the Old Testament is clearly not spontaneous. You know, it has all kinds of poetic form. Like this is being made to conform to certain kinds of poetic norms. This is just flow out of nowhere. Right. So, yeah, I think, you know, part of the point of using the forms that the church has established in our prayer. And I should say, by the way, just as a parenthetical aside, there's nothing wrong with standing in front of your icons and actually saying, God, give me, please give me patience for today and not having read that prayer from a book, looking for a prayer that says prayer for patience. You know, like, it's okay. It's okay to just say to God whatever your is on your mind."}

It might not like, feel right or feel authentic, whatever. Right. But it's like when you're learning how to do how to drive a car or play a musical instrument or whatever, like it's initially it's going to feel kind of awkward and weird, but you have to learn those norms and those rules, and then you can really go, you know, then you can really go. And so it's like learning how to speak or how to speak a new language. You have to learn the building blocks, the tools, the grammar, the structures, the rules, and then you can do something with that. Right? And in many cases, as a gift from God, people can ascend to the level where they're simply abiding in him and actually have what is sometimes called wordless prayer. But that is a gift from God. You don't, like, try to make it happen. Okay. Most of the people who are at that place have done a whole lot of the asking God for stuff and practicing patience and practicing fasting and practicing alms giving before they ever get to that. That point. Right. And I should say, right, like that kind of abiding prayer in God does not equal salvation. It's related, right? It's not like, oh, I've never achieved this wordless prayer in this life. Therefore, oh, no, I'm not going to make. That's not the point. It's not the point. Whatever God gives, that is for your salvation. Whatever God gives, whatever gift he gives you in terms of your ability to pray, that is for your salvation. And at this point it sounds like the gift is your prayer book. But it's perfectly okay again to just say, oh, God, give me strength. You know, there's nothing wrong with that. Nothing wrong with that. I often, I found like the quote unquote, spontaneous prayers that I use the most often are actually used often. A line from the Psalms. From the Psalms. You know, there's all kinds of stuff in there. But you know, it's okay to just simply talk to God and say whatever is on your heart. But you'd also need to be shaped by the norms of prayer in the church. Right? And the more that you do it, the more that you'll find your heart opened up. And eventually, like you memorize some psalms, eventually when you want to turn to God and really turn to him, you'll find that those are the words that come to mind, you know, that they actually plumb depths that you didn't even think about because you didn't know it, you didn't experience it, you hadn't been there. You know, so we have a lot of learning to do in terms of how to pray. And in many ways, that's what the Christian life is about. It's about learning how to pray, how to be with God. Because that's what prayer is about, is being with God. Like, we start out asking him for things, and I Shouldn't say. I say we start out, we never stop doing that. But that's the first level. We go because we need something and then eventually we go because we feel grateful. Right. And then eventually we go because we simply want to be with him. But that doesn't mean that the earlier levels, we stop doing that. But there is a kind of progression over time, I've noticed. So I hope that makes some sense. I know that kind of is kind."}
