In our time, many yearn to break free of the prison of a flat secular materialism, to see and to know reality as it truly is. What is this spiritual reality like? How do we engage with it? Well, how do we permeate everyday life with spiritual presence? Orthodox Christian priests Father Andrew Stephen Damick and Father Stephen DeYoung host this live call in show focused on enchantment in creation, the union of the seen and unseen as made by God and experienced by mankind throughout history. Welcome to the Lord of Spirits."}

Because I imagine most of our current listeners, whether live or later, will not be listening to this immediately after concluding that four hour marathon. And even then, they may have gotten diverted in their thinking by the calls at the end. And you know, a certain man of 1000 heresies calling in to ask me questions about Twin Peaks. So to get everybody back, back on the same page, a very short version of what we were talking about last time was talking about how do you compare Christianity and other things to be more specific."}

But so within that. That, of course, there are a bunch of obvious questions about that. Right.

{"episode_id":"LOS - #102 - 2024-10-10 - Modernism 101","start":428.31,"end":467.19,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"So it's a question of how do we recognize continuities and discontinuities and how much discontinuity do you need with sort of the flow of Christianity, the Christian tradition before you're now outside of it? How do we separate sort of an adaptation to changing way of life. Right. So, for example, human civilization has urbanized over the past several centuries.

And all kinds of things have changed. And so the church, Orthodox Christianity, has adapted to those things. Right. We have parking lots. They didn't have parking lots at the village church."}

And you could point at those and say, well, that's a difference, therefore that's a change. You didn't used to have parking lots. Now you have parking lots. See, your religion is not unchanging. Your religion has changed. Right. And we would look at that and say, well, okay, that's kind of silly. Right, Right. That's not a substantial change. That's just an adaptation to life in a new context."}

Hypothetically, if all of a sudden I tore down the iconostasis and put a rock band in the sanctuary around the altar, where you would look at that and say, okay, that's not orthodox Christianity anymore. That's something else. It may be some other type of Christianity, but it's something. It's not Orthodox Christianity anymore. Right. And there are things I could do where you would point out and say, okay, that's not even Christianity anymore."}

And so we talked about when we were talking about other groups that have so, for example, Christian elements or things about them that might look Christian."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #102 - 2024-10-10 - Modernism 101","start":604.83,"end":605.19,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Right."}

Right, Those things. So they're sort of Christian elements. Right. So Gnostics will talk about a redeemer or they'll talk about a Christ."}

They'll talk about a creator God that's not the one they like, but they'll talk about what? Right. So there are these terms, right. These things and people use. And it's not incorrect to refer to Christian Gnosticism over against other forms of Gnosticism, meaning forms of Gnosticism that have these Christian trappings versus some other ones. So there are forms of Gnosticism, for example, where the redeemer figure isn't Christ, it's Hercules."}

Well, if your deeper figure is Hercules, there's not even a pretense to Christianity. Right. You're firmly within the Greek pagan world. Right. And so we pointed out we were using three sort of things as our benchmarks. We. And we talked about how in the early church, Christian churches are encountering these other groups in other cities and other towns and other places, and they're trying to determine, okay, this other group that's meeting in this other town, are they a group of Christians like us or are they doing something else? Right. And it wasn't just like, well, they identify as Christians. So, okay, they're Christians. Right. There was actually, do we have certain things in common? And the three we were using particularly those groups were their view of, well, whether they had. And what scriptures they had."}

For things foreign to Christianity, foreign elements to Christianity. So they had different scriptures, they had different authority structures. They had radically different views of the material world. They practice a different way of life. And so the Christian groups that encountered them, and Saint Irenaeus, for example, writing for those Christian groups, said, no, you're not one of you guys are not part of us. You're not one of us. You're doing something different. Right. And we talked about how there's a certain sort of artificiality to it, that, as I mentioned, those Christian elements were in Neoplatonism and were in Gnosticism. Deliberately."}

And let's, you know, put these things together. It wasn't something that was revealed, you know, or grew up within a community or anything like that. It was. Yeah, yeah."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #102 - 2024-10-10 - Modernism 101","start":814.93,"end":839.25,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"To either incorporate what they thought were interesting Christian ideas or to appeal to the people that Christianity was appealing to in the case of Neoplatonism and try to win them back. It was a deliberate and therefore a kind of artificial thing. And we compared that to. Right. Not like Gnosticism and Neoplatonism to a false Christianity. And the example we used of a false Christianity was Arianism."}

But if you look at those elements I named, they were using the same scriptures, they had the same authority structures. Right. There were Aryan bishops, they had the same, roughly, view of the material world as Christians did, and they practiced roughly the same way of life morally and ethically. Right. They had the Eucharist, they had a liturgy. Right. And so that was, rather than being something other than Christian, that was a false Christianity."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #102 - 2024-10-10 - Modernism 101","start":888.37,"end":892.93,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Yeah. And they're, you know, they're canonically treated differently than non Christians."}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #102 - 2024-10-10 - Modernism 101","start":4284.12,"end":4337.19,"speaker":"Harrison","text":"Well, I have a question this time about another sort of modern. I call it a Gnostic heresy, sort of. Even though it's a little different. I've heard a lot of these weird teachings come out of some evangelical groups about Jesus being in a scene which is predicated by John the Baptist being in a scene, you know, from the Dead Sea Scrolls. And after some really light research, I came to understand that, well, that's not possible philosophically. I mean, Jesus preached the resurrection of the dead. It seems didn't believe in that at all. John the Baptist was in the wilderness from the age of what, like three until, you know, his. His ministry. And these things only went out every once in a while. They were still a community. So I was wondering if you may be able to fill me in on if you're aware of this weird new teaching and maybe some words that you would. You would give to some of the people who teach, you know, these. These types of things."}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #102 - 2024-10-10 - Modernism 101","start":4341.99,"end":4393.38,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"What I would say to them is, stop, stop it. Knock it off. Well, no, I would say all those things, but also. Yeah, it's so people get excited, right? They learn. They learn some things about the ancient world in the world of the Bible and the background in the New Testament, and they're cool things, and they get excited about learning them. And that's natural. That's not like a bad thing. And they start making connections. And making connections is sort of fun and exciting and invigorating and spurs you on to do more study and things. But when you're kind of excited and making connections, there's like a thin line between N.T. wright and Charlie Day in front of his cork board with the strings and the pictures."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #102 - 2024-10-10 - Modernism 101","start":4395.3,"end":4395.7,"speaker":"Harrison","text":"Right?"}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #102 - 2024-10-10 - Modernism 101","start":4396.5,"end":4613.85,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"And you could very easily fall off the edge of that. Right. In the wrong way. And this is one of those cases, right? So, I mean, even the identification of the Qumran community As Essenes isn't 100%. Yeah, right. Most scholars would agree on that. But as we just said the first half, these things aren't decided by vote. They're decided by reality, let alone then. But it's like, okay, well, they're out of the desert. St. John the Forerunner is out in the desert, right? There must be some kind of connection. And part of that gets fueled by. I'm trying to remember the name of the scholar. There was an early Roman Catholic scholar who studied very early on, studied the Dead Sea Scrolls. And when he wrote, he did his reconstruction of the community of Qumran, and it was like a Benedictine monastery, right? And you could tell he's just. He's understanding it from his own framework, right? His own. You know, but then that, right. Once that's out there, and you're like, well, you know, St. John the Forerunner is kind of this living this proto monastic life. There's these sort of proto Jewish monastics out there that there's got to be some connection there. Right? And then, you know, they, they look at some of the sectarian texts and the Dead Sea Scrolls, so they say, hey, some of this stuff that these texts say, Christ says stuff kind of like that in the Gospels, so he must be connected to it somehow too, you know. And then you get the guys who go the farthest, who are the guys who are like, oh, well, there's this teacher of righteousness who they talk about who was actually like the founder, sort of the leader, founding leader of the Qumran community in like the 3rd century BC but especially very early on, before all the texts had been read and cataloged and stuff, you got people going, teacher righteous. Oh, look, they're talking about him in kind of messianic terms. I bet that's Jesus. Yeah, right. Even though it's wrong century. Right. Like, so it's a lot of sort of excitement and then sort of making too many false connections just because things seem similar. And that is, and frankly, another part of the problem is capitalism in that going out and publishing a book about the intricate details of community life in Qumran is not going to sell a lot of copies. Going out selling a book saying that St. John the Baptist hand wrote the Dead Sea Scrolls, that, that'll get you on NPR and on the New York Times bestseller list about your groundbreaking theory that changes everything about Christianity. So people are kind of incentivized to take more and more radical positions on that kind of thing in order to get an audience, in order to get money. And it's not just sort of the crude, I want to be famous and make money. But even if you're a legitimate scholar and academic, you're trying to attract grant money and stuff. And it's, I need to make my work look important to someone other than me, you know, and part of, part of being a scholar is sometimes you have to accept that your work is only important to you."}

So all of those factors factor in there. But, you know, and, and you see this all the time with those Books, right. Oh, we just found a copy. We translated the Gospel of Judas.

But you know, either on the side of buying into them or on the side of getting especially worked up, I know people who, every time those things come out at Christmas, at Easter, this is an attack on Christianity. Right. They get all worked up the other way. Right. And it's just like, you know, stand back a little. You did the right thing by sort of doing a little bit of research and finding out like, oh, they're jumping to a lot of conclusions and pulling things together, that there's no real evidence of a connection. Right. And that's, that's what you usually find with these things."}

You know, when you said that these, these people who, you know, push these ideas often are, they're, they're not always ill intentioned, but they're, they're jumping from one conclusion to another and they're making connections that are kind of a far fetch. And, and I see that as sort of the danger that I've seen with some of the people who I know or care for that are sort of following this circle that it often leads like, oh, well, you know, it's possible that they also believed in like reincarnation. So they're trying to tie like something that's completely unrelated. A Google search away is like, no, the Essenes did not believe in reincarnation, not even. And then there's like, they get into like Earth magic and power of word and it just kind of opens this like wormhole of all this. Really. What you had an episode talking about this magic, this like quote unquote Christian, that's not really Christian magic. Yeah, it's kind of weird, you know, I wouldn't expect something like that to lead to such places.

He takes the French word difference and replaces the last. Well, the second to last E with an A difference, which to me sounds like exactly the same thing. But anyways, he spells it differently, which, you know, him doing that is kind of a joke. Right. He's saying that it's. He's. It's a very meta, kind of and very French sort of joke, but it's a philological joke. And it's essentially saying that the space between these things is so significant that. That all words, all signs are ultimately arbitrary. And like, it's. It's a way of taking nominalism and really pushing it to the very edge of its limits, you know, And. And so that.

Right. And so these people start to Become wealthy. They have financial and monetary power, but they don't have social and political power because that's all held by the nobility. Right.

Guys like Thomas Paine, who got thrown out of Britain for being a radical leftist, were the kind of guys who would have killed the King if they got the chance, but they didn't. But in France they do. And the Reign of Terror starts. Right. And the Reign of Terror starts in the name of Enlightenment, reason. Right. Liberte, egalitae, fraternity, all of these modernist values. This is an eruption of modernism. And so when you look at the reaction, when you look at Burke in particular, the founding father of traditional conservative philosophy, you look at Edmund Burke's response to the French Revolution, and what does he say? What is his argument against the French revolutionaries, against the Jacobins? His argument is, one of his central arguments is the. That they claim to know universal truth, they claim to have access to universal reason. And Burke says those things don't exist. There are only particular people in particular places, particular times, particular cultures, particular traditions, and that those are the things that have value, not these pretended universal rights. Universal right, egalitarianism, none of this. Right. And you could see there the seeds in Burke's conservatism of what will become the postmodern critique of modernity."}

That's what there exists. But there are no. There are no facts. There's no shared reality, even. And Nietzsche gives the great man theory of history, or at least a classical example of it.

But you have a great man who comes and tells you a story, and the story he tells you gives you meaning or reframes what the world means and even is right. And so he identifies, for example, Jesus of Nazareth as one of these people. He doesn't like the way Christianity transformed the world, but it did, right? He acknowledges that it did, right. He hates how it transformed the world, but he acknowledges it transformed the world, right? And his whole thing with the Ubermensch, right, The Overman, right, Who's coming is. He's talking about the next. There's going to be a next great man who comes and is going to redefine all this now, because he was convinced that the sort of Christian era in Europe was over and by all signs, 125 years later, is still kind of looking like that, sadly. But that someone was going to come and was going to then, you know, reevaluate all values, was going to come and transform everything. And of course, this invited somebody like Adolf Hitler to come and present himself and say, oh, yeah, I'm that guy. Right. Follow me. Right? Yeah. Even though Nietzsche would have hated him, like, virulently, but he presents that view, right? And this is very much drawing on these figures like Alexander the Great, Napoleon, right? So the way Michel Foucault kind of develops, that is that Foucault says, well, there are people who are in power, regardless of how they've come to have it, they have it and they can use that power, they could use what he calls force. And force for him is not always like physical force or violence. It could be force of will, force of persuasion, force of personality. Right? All of those things are in the force, but they come and they define things. So he takes sort of Nietzsche's Great man in Uber rich and says, well, it's a little more diffuse than that, right? So like, the king of a country, or even the president or prime minister of a country has to some degree the ability to do that within their own country. And so they will redefine language, they will invent new language. They will do that, and by doing that, they will reframe the way a given group of people under their power perceive the world."}

Postmodernism will say, no, only subjectivity is real. All of those things are language games that people are playing. They don't necessarily connect to reality in any way. Everyone just lives in their own subjectivity all the time. There is no reality, there's no factual reality that anyone has access to. Like, sure, there's material reality out there, probably, right?

You talk to a postmodernist who believes in the same thing. The postmodernist will just say to you something like, well, God loves everyone. Love is love. Who are you to judge? Right? It's a very different right approach, right? Because the modernist still thinks there's objective reality out there that they have to account for and work around, right. Whereas the postmodernist doesn't. And in terms of the self, we talked about how for the modernist yourself, your soul is something, is something fixed. You go and you try and find it.

I would speculate, and I don't know if any of the fathers have said this or what you would say to this Father Stephen, but that if there had not been a fall, that Christ still would have been incarnate, but that the crucifixion would not have been part of it because there would be no need to conquer death because death would not be in humanity.

{"episode_id":"LOS - #102 - 2024-10-10 - Modernism 101","start":9292.81,"end":9422.68,"speaker":"Harrison","text":"Yeah, thank you, Father. Thanks for taking my call. I actually caught in fairly late to the episode, but what I've caught so far sparked a question that's been on my mind quite a bit for a long time, which is, you know, with this discussion of tradition, modernism, postmodernism, evidence, you know, the text, sentiment, the feelings of what feels right, what am I being led to? So for me, as somebody coming from a Protestant background, I think I've had some exposure to more of the mainline things. Growing up Lutheran and then drifted completely away from the church, came back to a more sort of evangelically four square kind of non denominational ish. That might upset some people, but that was the feeling I had since then. I've been very drawn the last few years to orthodoxy. The more I've learned about it, and I could explain more about why that is if that would be helpful for anybody listening. But it's, it's been a difficult question for me. Are there things I really like about this? And like you said, there are people who, you know, I think I have this temptation to want to do it because it's cool, because I like the way it feels. And I just, a couple of weeks ago went to vespers for the first time and really had a very moving experience that felt, I told the priest afterwards, this really feels like I stepped back in time. And he said, oh, you stepped out of time. Yeah, you got me. But it was, it really was a different kind of feeling. But I think I have trouble whenever I start thinking about this, like, do I actually want to commit to this? And obviously it's a long process. But how do I know what the right church is? You know, there are churches that have, can explain the history and apostolic succession and all of that, but when it comes down to it, what do I really have besides the feeling of, is this where God wants me?"}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #102 - 2024-10-10 - Modernism 101","start":9425.56,"end":9685.54,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Yeah. And you know, especially within the context of what we've just been discussing, and I mean, a lot of people have pointed this out at various times. The act of making a decision to become an orthodox Christian, as opposed to all the other options in front of you, is a very modern act. Right, right. And I mean, here's the thing. In our cultural context, it's inescapable. Right. Like, what else can you do? You know, most people did not grow up within a context where there are a bunch of religious options. I mean, certainly, and not even in this way, like in the first century when the apostles were first preaching the gospel, they were in a multi religious context, but not in the sense of like, I'm going to pick which religion I like or I want or I think is the right one. It was rather there's all these gods being worshiped and someone could worship multiple ones. In fact, most people did, you know, they wouldn't say, well, I prefer this one, you know. So in some ways, in a lot of ways, we're in a historically unprecedented period where people make decisions to join a church. And I don't see a way out of that in America in 2024. I don't, I don't think it's right for me, especially as an orthodox priest, to say you should just simply stay in whatever you were born in, period, no matter what, because that's not, that's not right either, you know, So I mean, one of the things that I discovered, because I at least for me, becoming an Orthodox Christian, you know, as I've mentioned a couple times in this episode, I was raised evangelical. Although more and more, I have to say, not like those events. You know, it was. It was different. It was simply different. I mean, I was. I was born. Father Stephen and I were both born in the same year in the mid-1970s. So, like. But we weren't. We weren't raised with the same tradition. He was raised Dutch Reformed. I was raised kind of Baptist, ish, you know, and it was. It was different for sure, in the 80s and early 90s, you know, than it is now. But I nonetheless, you know, I made a decision to leave that and to become an Orthodox Christian. That is a modern act. It's just the way that it is. And for me, a lot of what I went through at the time was, okay, well, let me try to, as much as I can, kind of turn the clock back on Christianity and go to the beginning and see which groups veered off when, you know, and is there any that stayed that did not veer off, that remain consistent and continuous? You know, and that was the way that I now, almost 30 years ago, made that decision, at least mentally, intellectually. The thing that really propelled me in terms of wanting to truly stay was the power of experiencing orthodox Christian worship. But ultimately, what I would say to anybody is, and how do I know where to be? Is not an answer that I can give that is going to satisfy an intellectual set of categories. But rather it is, if you have met Christ and you are willing to turn yourself over to Christ in this particular place, and he is clearest to you in this place, then I think in good conscience, that's where a person should be. That doesn't mean that I agree that all are equal or that all are right or whatever. I believe that orthodox Christianity is the place for that. But if someone is truly seeking God, humbly, you know, I, I can't fault wherever it is that he happens to be, even if it's not where I. I think he should be yet, you know."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #102 - 2024-10-10 - Modernism 101","start":9687.38,"end":9687.78,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Because."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #102 - 2024-10-10 - Modernism 101","start":9687.78,"end":9832.84,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"And here's why. Because I know of people who have looked at, like, let's just say, for instance, you know, a lot of people, that it comes down to a question between orthodox Christianity and Roman Catholicism, right? Because they're like, well, these are the kind of the two earliest possibilities, you know, and then some might. Might add on the, the. The. What are called the Oriental Orthodox churches. Like, okay, I've got these three options in front of me. Which one is right? They all have Apostolic, you know, origins. Which one is right? I've known of people who've looked at all the same evidence, like, really read it all, really struggled through it all and made different decisions in the end. And I can't say I know exactly why that is the case. It would be tempting to say, well, this person's just too stupid to understand the differences. Or, or, or, I mean, no, no, this is right. Or too stupid or too uninformed. Right. Like, no, I don't think you really read all the books, you know, or, or that they have an ulterior motive. Well, you chose this one because, you know. Right. I, I don't think that those three things can explain. And I, I, it maybe does explain some choice, a lot of choices people make. But if we're going to assume good faith, then we can't assume any of those three things. Those are things for people to ask themselves, you know, am I doing this in good faith? Did I really, you know, whatever. I will tell you. I really recently learned of a very distant relative of mine, like a third cousin in another country, whom I actually just relatively recently met for the first time. And she told me that she had decided to become Orthodox, which shocked me because I was shocked. We had just met. I thought, well, I didn't talk to you about any of this. There's no way I was actually a factor in any way. And I was like, well, why? And it turned out that she had been stopping at an Orthodox church for years to go and light a candle and pray and just loved it in there. And I thought to myself, you know what? I cannot fault that even a little bit. I can't. Even though that is not a big intellectual journey, right? That is not. It's not. So that's what I would say all about that. I don't know that that's like a satisfactory answer, but I'm going to hand the baton over to Father Steven and see what he's."}

Even if people who claim to have objective knowledge of us tell me over and over again, it will be a disaster. I am going to marry her based on my feelings, based on the experience I have when I'm with her. But the way you actually should pick the girl you're going to marry is. Includes both of those.

Here's the experience I have in worship. Right. Here's how. Here's how I feel. Here's. Right. But the reason to choose to be a part of the Church brings both of those together and then surpasses it. And that thing that surpasses it is an encounter with Christ. And what does that mean? Right. I can't Define exactly what that means to encounter Christ, even though I believe I had it happen any more than I can define what it was that made me know I should marry my wife Trisha. And that happened to me too. Right. But that doesn't mean it's not real. The fact that I can't define it or fully describe it. And I tell every inquirer and every catechumen who comes into my parish that there are a lot of reasons why people join the Orthodox Church, but there's only one good one, and that's that you have that encounter with Christ that brings together those two elements and then supersedes them. If you don't have that in my parish, you should not join my parish. And if you do, then you should just like, if you don't have that with. With a woman, you shouldn't marry her. But if you do, then you should. Does that make sense? Even though it's not something you can totally define, there's an ineffable quality to it, which you would expect. God."}

I was already kind of leaning that direction. So the fact that these two answers, both of your answers have kind of come together into this. Yeah, you'll know. I think that's probably my answer. But I will say, just to sort of add on to both of those, that I think I could see both of both of those extremes, if you want to call them that, leading towards the center. Those are just two prongs that can kind of catch people who go in either direction, either to the intellectual or the sentimental. And I do both at different times and have been really satisfied in both of those ways with the Orthodox Church so far. So, yeah, I'll certainly keep exploring.

That last bit about national churches and national is, frankly, I know I've talked about the show before. This is why I'm so down on the idea of an American Orthodox Church. I know it was a dream of Metropolitan Philip of Thrice Blessed Memory, that he, in his lifetime, which didn't happen, would see united American Orthodox Church with respect to His Eminence. I'm glad it didn't happen and I hope it doesn't happen while I'm still alive. Because right now, the way American culture and society is, and as weak and small as Orthodox Christianity is in the United States, the influence will only go one way if there's an American Orthodox Church.

{"episode_id":"LOS - #102 - 2024-10-10 - Modernism 101","start":11619.52,"end":12077.27,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"But probably not. So, yeah, I know that this episode. So just, you know, some. Some wrap up thoughts. I know that this episode, I mean, literally, pretty philosophical at points. Although honestly, I mean, we. It was mostly overview in a lot of ways, a lot of. A lot of these ideas, which is probably about the most that most of us can take, including me most of the time, despite my forays into reading Terry Eagleton. But I think that for me, the big takeaway of a lot of this is number one. Even though maybe at moments like this we can step back and see big swaths of history and say, oh, so that's what the problem with everything is. We still are where we are. You know, I think of that poem by Tennyson, I think it's called Ulysses where he says, you know, I'm probably misremembering some of the lines, but, you know, essentially, you know, even though we don't have that strength that we. That we had in olden days, we are what we are. What we are. We are. I think that's the line and I think that that's an important thing to remember. Not so we can just throw our hands up and say, well, there's nothing to be done, but. But rather just to take it in humility, say, okay, I'm a modern person, live in the modern period. I see the problems of modernism, or at least some of them, and I'm going to stumble forward trying not to fall in any of the ditches that I'm surrounded by. I think one of the big temptations is to think that we're special in that we have big struggles like this, but we're not. Every historical era and every historical place has its problems, has its big temptations. And we know that people go careening off onto the wrong paths. And we know that in the midst of those situations that people become holy, that people become sons of God. You know, there is no golden era. And yeah, it's true, we're not in it, but there isn't. There isn't one. There were certain points where maybe the material situation, the church was much better, but that doesn't mean that conditions for being saved were better. Doesn't mean that. For me, if we're going to look to any era of church history and find inspiration first, I mean, all of them, right? There's saints in all the eras of church history, and we can find inspiration from all of those saints in various ways. But if there's one, I'm going to pick and say, this is the one that I think we need to hold up first. That doesn't mean we don't hold up the other ones ever. But the one we need to hold up first is the first one is the apostolic period, where the apostles are going out into all the world, preaching the gospel, baptizing in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, and making disciples of every creature, and teaching them to do all that Christ commanded them. And it just so happens, I believe that our current era, while not the same in some pretty big important ways, in many ways, because of this postmodern cultural milieu we're in now, I think is much like the time of the apostles. It was a very poly religious period with a lot of cross currents, a lot going on, a lot of directions to move in. You know, it's not the modern world where you pick a religion. It's not that. But nonetheless, there was a lot to be confused by and a lot to draw the eye and a lot to draw desire, and frankly, a lot of. A lot of real decadence and material gluttony of various kinds. We have all of that. And the apostles went out without any expectation that they were going to be successful in their culture. They went out and obeyed what God told them to do, they went out and they preached the gospel to people. And anyone who listened, anyone who said, yes, I'm on board with that, how do I be saved? They baptized them, they taught them how to be faithful, and then the next generation received that and they passed it on and they passed it on and on and on down to us, the littlest and least of the brothers and sisters of the Christian story. So I mean, for me, whenever I hear even some of the very depressing stuff we talked about, and I think like, I mean, there's points like we're talking about the privileging of experience, right? Like, I know that when I've talked about orthodox Christianity with people over the last few decades, I know I have made appeals to experience sometimes for people. And I also know, like how problematic that is, but I also know, like appeals to the more kind of intellectual approach and also how problematic that is. But nonetheless, I have hope because it's not me who is really giving them Christ, and it's not even truly themselves who are discovering Christ. It's Christ who has come to look for us. And the way that he meets each person, the way that each person encounters him is, is going to be different and, and mysterious and particular to them, but, but participating in the common experience of Christ that the Church has. And then it's not only that initial experience, then it's an ongoing experience and receiving from other people within the church their experience as well. And receiving all of these things together. I mean, this is how a tradition works. It's this river running through history that has all of the church in it. And so for me it always comes down to hope. And it's not hope like, well, I hope that happens, but it's this fundamental upward gazing hope where we see Christ. And even though there's going to be stones on the road and ruts to fall into, we step forward, we stumble forward, and we give thanks along the way. So that's what I have to say."}

So, yeah, so this is sort of, this episode we sort of did an episode that turned into a two part series that then turned into a three part series. And I think both where we started and where we ended up are very germane to the whole raison d' et of this show. Because this show isn't just a Bible show, right? The raison d' et of the show from the beginning has been that we're trying to reacquire some of the wisdom that was lost in the movement into Modernism, where we gained this incredible knowledge of science and technology, which is all real knowledge, but we lost the spiritual wisdom that maybe we had before in trying to recover that. So discussing what Modernism is is very germane, as is talking about the spiritual experience of Neolithic hunter gatherers, which is where we started out two episodes ago. But mainly the last couple episodes, what we've been talking about is this contrast between Christianity between the church as it exists in the world, and that Christianity being a transformative influence on the world in which it exists, versus the that Christianity being twisted and deformed by the world in which it exists and turned into something different by these foreign elements that come and intrude. And what we've been saying about church communities applies just as much to me as a person. So we've talked about, and we talked about tonight that my identity as a person is not as an individual, and it's not some ever shifting protean self either. But it is the sort of stacked up and meshed web of relationships that I exist in. I'm a priest, I'm the pastor of a parish, I'm a husband, I'm a spiritual father, I'm a brother, I'm a son, I'm an uncle, I'm a great uncle. I'm old, I'm a friend to certain people, I'm an acquaintance of certain other people. I'm a writer of books, which is a certain kind of relationship with readers make this podcast. It's a certain type of relationship with listeners. All of these things make up my identity. Obviously I'm an orthodox Christian within that. But I can choose. And I have to choose. And more than choosing, it's not just a question of making choices. Often it feels more like a struggle or a fight one way or the other, to allow my orthodox Christian identity to be sort of subsumed, to be shifted, to be conditioned, to be warped or diminished by the world I live in with all of its modern and postmodern currents. Or I can choose to live in a way and to struggle in a way in which my orthodox Christianity, and by that I essentially mean the presence of the Holy Spirit within me, allow that to transform me and then through transforming me through that web of relationships, begin to transform the world around me. There is no kind of middle ground there. There is no kind of middle point. There's no homeostasis where you can just relax and now you know everything's okay and you can go about your business Back to my hobbies. I've got that whole Christianity thing covered. One of those two things will be happening. We'll be being shaped by one or the other will be being shaped by the Holy Spirit as a person, or will be being shaped by the various spirits that are active in our world, the zeitgeists that are out there pushing at us and wanting to lead us in other directions. The promise that the Holy Spirit has is that the transformation that the Holy Spirit offers to the Christian, to the Christian who struggles, struggles with repentance, struggles to do good, struggles to bring forth the fruit of the Spirit. You've got to tend a garden, gotta tend an orchard. For it to bring forth fruit is, as I said, not only that we would be transformed by it, but that through the web of relationships that connects us to those around us, connects us to our world, that our world and those other people would be transformed. It's kind of a chain reaction. This is what Saint Seraphim of Sarah was talking about in the famous quote choir, the Holy Spirit, thousands will be saved all around you. That is our task. And so I hope, and that's why I put it here at the very end, right, that people's takeaway, everything we had to say about the church and society and history and religion in these episodes as it, as it developed, changed, where there were breaks, continuities, discontinuities over time, throughout human history, all of that is good stuff from my perspective. I think all of it's important. That's why we did the episode episodes. But if we don't take that and apply it to our own day to day way of life, our own day to day struggle to be, as St. Paul says, in the world, but not of the world, to be shaping the world, not being shaped by it. If we don't apply that, then, you know, this is so much abstract formulation, right? It's knowledge that puffs up. We could think, I'm smart, I understand all of these currents in our culture, but it won't actually profit us anything. So we need to be struggling harder in our own life against foreign ideas, foreign ideologies and intruders than we do against those intruders in our church. God will take care of those intruders in our church, Bishops will take care of those intruders in our church, right? If we take care of those intrusions in our own life through that web of relationships, that will help take care of those intruders in our church. Because if we're talking about intruders that aren't human, if we're talking about spirits, those get cast out. If we're talking about people coming into our churches who are moved by those spirits, then when those spirits get cast out, we transform our quote unquote enemies into friends. That's part of that transformation, too. That's why we don't throw out our liberals. That's why we don't throw out our reactionaries. That's why we don't throw out our postmodernists. Because I'm one of those. Somewhere in there is me, right? Or at least was. Hopefully more was than is. And that transformation is transforming us all together. So in summary, yes, hopefully, if you've listened to this, don't just try to apply it to the Neolithic era. Don't just try to apply it to your understanding of what's going on in evangelicalism. But first and foremost, try and apply it to yourself. And as I try it to apply it to myself."}
