And he will be the light of the nations and the hope of those whose hearts are troubled. All who dwell on the earth will fall down and worship him. And they will praise and bless and celebrate with song the lord of spirits. First Enoch, chapter 48, verses 4 through 5. The modern world doesn't acknowledge, but is nevertheless haunted by spirits, angels, demons and saints. In our time, many yearn to break free of the prison of a flat secular materialism, to see and to know reality as it truly is. What is this spiritual reality like? How do we engage with it? Well, how do we permeate everyday life with spiritual presence? Orthodox Christian priests, Father Andrew Stephen Damick and Fr. Stephen DeYoung host this live call in show focused on enchantment in creation, the union of the seen and unseen as made by God and experienced by mankind throughout history. Welcome to the Lord of Spirits."}

I feel like there's a William Shatner reference in here somewhere, but it's just not coming to me. Oh, oh, oh, there it is. There it is. Yeah, yeah. Mirror universe. Okay, audience, work on the joke throughout the episode. All right, so in this episode, we're continuing to talk about apocryphal Second Temple Jewish texts, and this time we're talking about the Ascension of Isaiah and the assumption of Moses. Don't mix them up. These texts straddle the time of the birth of Christ and very much blur the conventional distinctions a lot of people have in their heads between Jewish and Christian texts. And for those of you who've listened to this podcast for a long time, these texts will include some elements that we have mentioned many times, so it should be a lot of fun. But even if this is your very first episode, because we know for a lot of people, for every episode, some episode is their first episode. This should still be fascinating, I think. So you don't have to have listened for a long time in order to get this one. So this is actually really the Enoch episode finally, right?"}

Yes, you can go and look that one up if you want to hear us go on and on about that one in particular. But here we're talking about humans, Right. Regular humans. So that's a bodily still living ascend into heaven. Enoch and Elijah are examples. And then there are assumptions. And when we talk about an assumption like the assumption of Moses that we're talking about tonight, we're talking about someone who has died and then their body is taken up into heaven. So in a way, an assumption is sort of an early resurrection, meaning their body, since it's being taken up, is reunited with their soul sort of in advance of the general bodily resurrection of everyone."}

The mother of Christ, who is also the mother of God. Come at me with your story. And not because Christ is God. Yes. So these are sort of slightly different. Right. One is they're still alive, taken up into heaven. The other is a person dies and then their body is taken up, meaning taken up and reunited with them. So the question, the key distinction is has the person died or not? Right, Right. So we're not going to spend a ton of time because it's not totally germane to the two texts that we're talking about tonight. Talking about Enoch and Elijah in detail. We have in the past talked in more detail about them and their ascents to heaven, especially in our episodes about saints. And we'll be coming back to obviously Enoch, maybe less obviously to folks, Elijah later on as we continue this series on and off, talking about Second Temple texts. Because of course, Enoch, as you know, has a number of them named after him and a whole genre of literature named after him. Indeed. But there's also an apocalypse of Elijah, for example. Yeah."}

If you want to read, I mean, Those texts, Genesis 5, verses 21 through 24, talks about Enoch's being taken up into heaven and 2 Kings 2 or 4th kingdoms, 2, 1, 14 talks about Elijah. But in terms of how those ascents sort of come to function, in terms of later Jewish and Christian tradition and Second Temple Jewish literature, those ascents are seen as occasions for apocalyptic visions."}

Something is revealed, something is unveiled. Right. And so if they're going up into heaven, not only are they seeing what's in heaven in the place where they go and wherever else they go on some kind of cosmic journey, but they're also seeing, and this is kind of important for the text we're talking about tonight again, as it has been for some of the other ones we talked about, they're also seeing the earth and what's going on on the earth and the history of the earth from that perspective."}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #094 - 2024-06-13 - The Ascension of Isaiah and the Assumption of Moses","start":872.99,"end":969.83,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"And so all apocalyptic literature, by definition, involves someone taking that kind of journey. Right. And so when you have these two figures from the Hebrew scriptures who were told were taken up into heaven, that then presents this good opportunity for apocalyptic literature to be composed and become attached to those figures. This also sets up from the perspective of later literature, the idea that, well, since they didn't die, they were just sort of taken up into heaven. This then seemed to present the opportunity that they could come back, they could reappear. Right. And this. So, for example, with Enoch, eventually, when we do that first Enoch episode, we'll talk about in some of the later sections that aren't in all the versions, but in some of the later sections, for example, Enoch comes back and, like, appears to Methuselah or appears to Noah to communicate things to them. And since he didn't die, was taken up into heaven, he could sort of reappear in bodily form and interact with them, interact with his descendants. And of course, not only within scripture, but outside of scriptures, there's all kinds of Jewish tradition about the return of Elijah. Right. From leaving a chair open for him."}

And then we also see an image here, and this takes off, for example, from some of the details, like the detail that The Prophet Elijah, St. Elias, is taken up into heaven in a chariot. This is connected to the idea of God's chariot throne. We talked about this more in our episodes about saints. But so these two men from the Hebrew scriptures come to represent sort of the image of what a redeemed human being looks like, that they were sort of. They experienced salvation to such an extent in this life that they didn't die and they were taken up into heaven. And then because of the idea of the chariot throne, they're sort of included in God's divine council sort of immediately along with the angels. Right. And even those reappearances, like Enoch's reappearances, are sort of connected to. He's doing the kind of things that God would send an angel to do. Yeah, right. To convey information, to convey messages. He's Sort of functioning as an angel. The sense of functioning as a messenger. Right. Of God. And you see that connection also with the Elijah traditions, both in the Hebrew scriptures and around it, where he's coming before the Messiah to bring some message to announce. Right. Sort of the coming of the Messiah. Again, that's a kind of angelic mission, which is why you sometimes see St. John the Forerunner with angel wings."}

Hey, they won't publish your article if you're just saying, like, everything you thought was true is actually. Yeah, but anyway, the case of Moses is much more ambiguous if you're trying to just go by just strictly by the couple of verses that describe the death of Moses. Right. It's not obvious.

Took care of his dead body in that place, but no one knows where his grave is.

That God took his body, meaning he took it into heaven, right? And while that is never explicitly said in the New Testament. Right. It ever straight out says, in the New Testament, God took Moses body into heaven."}

That would have been weird if you didn't know about this tradition, right? Because as we've already said, Elijah coming back, sure, right. Like didn't die, right? Bodies up in heaven, they're expecting him to come back maybe multiple times, right? But usually when you get two people showing up, it's Enoch and Elijah, right? Enoch is the other one who went up into heaven without dying, right? And so you can see this if you read the earliest interpretations we have of the Book of revelation, right? Revelation, St. John, you'll see that pretty much everybody says that the two witnesses who show up, the two witnesses that Revelation talks about are Enoch and Elijah, the two guys who left. The two guys come back, right? And then they interpret that different ways, whether it's literally Enoch and Elijah, whether that's representative of Christ and St. John the Forerunner. There's different places they go with that, right after that. But that's the identification they make because that's sort of the natural identification even in a lot of Jewish literature. But anything that's in the orbit of this tradition about Moses, then what happens on the Mount of Transfiguration makes sense because Moses has also been reunited with his body, right? The story of the Mount of Transfiguration doesn't say Elijah and the ghost of Moses, right? Elijah and the spirit of Moses, Elijah and the soul of Moses. They're Both presented there as being bodily, as being recognizable. So they have this sense of identity about them such that the disciples know who they. Peter, James and John know who they are. Right. Know that that's Moses and Elijah. It's almost like they'd seen pictures of them somewhere before."}

But when the archangel Michael, contending with the devil, was disputing about the body of Moses, he did not presume to pronounce a blasphemous judgment, but said, the Lord rebuke you without.

But we can already go ahead and say here, we don't know for sure that this is a reference or the Lord rebuk you is a quote. We don't know for sure that that's a direct reference to the text. The assumption of Moses, in fact, probably isn't. It could be. But this is a reference to the traditions that we have recorded in the assumption of Moses. And notice how. Yeah.

And so St. Paul is there using this mechanism to talk about Christ's resurrection as the beginning, the first fruits of the general resurrection. Christ's resurrection is the resurrection. Right. And that's connected to this idea that his body did not at any point decay. Right. Because as Christ says in St. John's Gospel, he says, the ruler of this world is coming for me. He has no claim over him. Right. He finds nothing in him. He has no claim on Jesus. And so the things that are pitted against each other are the resurrection versus corruption."}

I don't mean it happened because it happened. Right. What I mean by that is there's this tendency nowadays in conversations. Right. So I'll use another example related to the Theotokos, because this is one that has come up a lot at Least around me. Right. And that's over the fact that the Theotokos didn't have any other.

You can't give me an adequate or acceptable to me, explanation of why or what it means or why it's important. Therefore I reject that it's true. Yeah, right. Therefore I reject that it's true. And there's a. The problem with that is that all of these things, all of these events in and around Scripture which relate to the Christian tradition and our faith, including the very most important ones, the central ones, all happened first. They just happened and they didn't happen in a way that explained themselves. And then after the fact, the church reflected on those things and the whys and the what it means and the why it's important. Right. Comes out of that later reflection. So to use a couple of the very most important and central things of the Christian faith, right. As examples, Christ rose from the dead. That's as central as you get. That is the central proclamation of Christianity. Christ is risen. Right. Christ rose from the dead. That did not come with an explanation in and of itself at the time. Christ rose from the dead.

Then later, after this has happened and after Christ has appeared and explained a little bit, at least what it was about, you get St. Paul writing 1 Corinthians 15 about the resurrection and reflecting on Christ's resurrection and other passages all through the New Testament, all through the writings of the Church Fathers, all through the writings of the Church in every era, reflecting upon. Right. That's what real theology, if we're talking about theological writing, is. It's not coming up with new arguments and new stuff. Right. It's reflecting upon who Christ is and what he's done. Right. And the experience of Christ. So. Right. You see this pattern. It happens and they understand it. We can say the same thing about the crucifixion. Right. Christ is crucified. Christ dies on the cross. Right. Pretty central to the whole Christian faith. Right. But at the time, no one understands why it's happening. In fact, pretty much everybody misunderstands what happened there at the time, after the fact.

Is that pretty much exactly what's summed up in that quote? Father Andrew read that. You're making the Theotokos something other than a human.

One of the first things between Roman Catholic and Orthodox folks, one of the first things you'll hear from the Orthodox side is that for us, it's not a dogma.

Right. I know post Vatican ii, we've all gotten mushy about everything, but that's still the official on the books in Latin teaching of Rome. If you consciously reject one of these dogmas, you can't go to heaven. And of course, the Protestant response to that is like, what? These things that aren't the Bible, first of all, obviously, because Protestants generally hold to some form of sola scriptura. Right. But so because of that kind of debate, the debate then shifts.

That's where it leads. Right. That's where it leads. But it starts on a very personal level. It starts with individuals, this idea that, again, comes out of the Reformation of, oh, if you tell people they have to believe these things, that teaching you something about the history of the church that isn't in the Bible, Literally, plain as day. Can't question it, can't doubt it. So teaching you about the fact that, hey, did you know that after the Theotokos died, her body was taken up into heaven? I am somehow imposing on you.

That's one of the things. I see this a lot because a lot of the work I do is aimed at evangelism. And so people ask the question, like, well, do I have to believe that in order to be an orthodox Christian? And, like, I mean, often the short answer to most of those questions is yes. But the. I think the more important answer is, look, do you want to be part of this community? Do you want to live this life? Because, I mean, as I've found, especially when I was doing pastoral ministry, that conviction actually tends to follow conditioning, that the things that you believe actually tend to flow out of the way you live and what you're participating in rather than being the prerequisite for that, you know, like. And it works the other way too. Like, I've watched people, for instance, who were faithfully Orthodox, and then they, for one reason or another, they started to attend another church. Like one example that I know of, for instance, a family member asked them, would you please come with me or take me all the time. And it wasn't that they had a conversion experience while they were there or that they suddenly realized, hold on a second. I no longer believe this, and I now believe this. It's that the habit of being in that other church turned them into that. And then all kinds of sort of doctrinal explanations followed. But it wasn't like, hey, I had a. You know, I came to an awareness of, I disagree with this now, and I agree with this. And so therefore, I'm going to go over there. And that's why there's also this whole phenomenon. I see this a lot, too. People say, oh, I agree with all this stuff, but I just can't bring myself to walk through the door. I agree with all of this. Or even people who call themselves Orthodox but have never actually even been to an Orthodox Church, there's this disjunction. Right. It's this notion that Christianity is a list of things that you get, as you said, like boxes that you check off. I agree. I disagree. You know."}

And it's for a variety of reasons. Right. And I'm not just saying this. If you're not Orthodox. Orthodox people, too. Oh, yeah, right. You know, people, if they are parishes in my church and I get up and preach and I preach about what reading from The Gospel of St. John means, and they believe it. They're trusting me. They have, for various reasons, decided that they could trust my explanations of these things. It could be a variety of reasons among the different members of my congregation. So this isn't just. Again, this is everyone. This is every human. You are believing someone. Right. You are trusting someone, Someone's explanation, someone's interpretations. Right. And for various reasons. Right. There are various reasons why you accept person A's as opposed to person B's or group A's as opposed to group B's, Right. You may or may not be aware of them at any given point in time. You may be very aware of them, maybe very conscious of them. It may be related to decisions you've actually made or that may be kind of sub rosa, kind of unconscious or subconscious with you. And you know, but if people believed things because they were true, no one would ever be wrong. They'd always believe the truth. Right? So we have all these other reasons. And so you're trusting. And so that's the real question we have to ask, Right? There's some danger here because if we set up, if I set up myself as the judge of all things, right. I'm going to hear from the representatives of all these different views and then I'm going to decide for myself who is right and what the right thing to do is or the right way to go is. Right. Scriptures tell us there's a way that seems right to a man and it's end is destruction. We should remember that. Right? So I can't just trust my own judgment. My own judgment is flawed and sinful by definition. Right. I need, I need others, right? And so we're going to choose to submit to something, to be a part of something, right. To receive something, to enter into a Christian tradition, right. That existed before we were born. If it didn't exist before you were born, don't even think about it. It's not worth it. We got made up last weekend. It's wrong, I assure you. Right. That's what we, that's what we submit to. Right? And so when people say things to me or around me like, well, I agree with a lot of stuff of the Orthodox Church or the Orthodox Church seems good to me in these various ways.

Ancient text, if that is your real name. Yeah. It's important to understand the difference between an ascension and an assumption. And the basic thing that they turn on is whether the person is dead or not. If they're alive still and they're caught up into heaven, it is an ascension. If they're dead, it is an assumption of their body. And this is the Orthodox Take on this. As we said, there's the Roman Catholic take and there's ambiguity built into that and you can find all kinds of explanations of that. So, you know, go look that up for yourself if you want to read all about the way that the Catholics explain what happened there. But yeah, so the first of the two texts we're going to talk about is the Ascension of Isaiah. So we know who the prophet Isaiah is, but it turns out there's actually a whole bunch of traditions surrounding him that are not mentioned explicitly in the Old Testament.

So all three parts come from the second half of the first century A.D. okay. So these things, including the Christian parts, the two parts that we're calling Christian parts were written during the time when the. A lot of the New Testament was being written. So that's important to keep in mind. Yeah, right. The stuff we're calling Christian material here is not like later Christian material. It is as early as and earlier than some of the books of the New Testament, the three parts were put together in the form that we have them now, sometime early in the second century, in the first half of the second century, it took its current form. We know that because we start finding citations of the text in the second century. Yeah. In the shape that it's in now. So this is as early as it gets. That's gonna be important to remember when we see some of the content of the Christian sections, by the way. But it is a. It is a composite like that. So part one, Right. Piece one, the non Christian Jewish part. And again by that, by the fact that I'm saying non Christian, do not assume that that means anti Christian. It just means it came from a Jewish source and the Jewish source that produced it was not a Christian. So there's no antipathy to Christianity or anything here. And it doesn't seem to have been edited by whoever. Right. Someone could have, whoever put it in its current form with all the Christian pieces in it and on it. Right. Could have gone through and edited this part. Right. If they wanted to, yeah. They could have gone and made it like really obviously Christian too. But they didn't. Right? They didn't. So the fact that they didn't shows you that it's definitely not anti Christian. Right. Like it's not contradictory. They didn't feel the need to. They felt like they could just add to it. They didn't need to change anything. So this is what makes up chapters one through five. And a note here. I wanted to do this earlier, but I forgot when we give chapters and verse numbers on these texts, we're almost always. There are exceptions, but almost always going by Charlesworth's numbers, which."}

And we're doing that because every time people have asked us where to get these texts, we point them to the two volume Charles Worth Old Testament Pseudepigrapha.

And so we have to do something a little different. But almost always when we give them, we're using Charlesworth. Those are not standardized. Right. Like chapter adverse.

Right. So eventually when we do the one on first Enoch there are radically different in length versions of the book of Enoch in different languages of first Enoch. And so if you tried to follow the same numbering scheme, it would be a mess. Right. Like in the shorter versions, if you were translating one of the, if you're translating say the shorter Greek version. Greek version is much shorter than the, the Amharic version. Then you'd have to figure out how to use the numbers. Right. Like do I skip verse numbers when there's material that's left out of the shorter version? So I go like verse 27 and then verse 33. People don't notice and think it's weird. Right. So there's a reason for that. Everybody just numbers the version that they're translating.

Right. But that they're both representing stuff that's not in the Old Testament. So the fact that Isaiah was sawn in two and that's how he died. He died as a martyr.

So we can't say for sure, but much more closely related to it that more of the details and more of the shape of the story. Right. Is there the Talmud? That's part of the reason, by the way, that we say that this part comes from a non Christian Jewish source, because if it came from a Christian, even a Christian Jewish source, it's unlikely that the Talmud would pick it up unaltered. So. Right. This is part of the general reservoir of Jewish tradition, not the specifically Christian strand of Jewish tradition. So basically what happens in terms of the narrative is that Hezekiah dies. Isaiah has revealed to him that Manasseh is going to become king of Israel. Manasseh is a bad dude. Right. We have the tradition as represented in the prayer of Manasseh, a little piece of extra biblical content that Manasseh eventually repented, but for most of his life he was exceedingly wicked and sort of brought back paganism full force in Israel. So Isaiah kind of realizes this is going to happen, is forewarned because he's a prophet. And so he takes the community of the prophets, which was a thing, and takes them into the desert, the Judean desert, away from, right, the cities to be Away from the king and his ability to enforce his evil decrees. As I mentioned, we talked about this in our episode on the phenomenon of prophets, which I think was called prophet motive."}

So the prophets. There's a whole community of prophets and their wives and their children. Right. Who live together in sort of a communal mode of living. We see this reflected throughout the Hebrew scriptures in a whole series of points. Remember, there's the city of prophets where Samuel is that Saul goes down to and then rips off all his clothes and thrashes around on the ground. And there's Elisha after the prophet Elijah ascends into heaven, as we were just talking about. Goes back to the community of the prophets. Right. So this community of prophets is a thing. Right.

And so they go out into the desert to avoid Manasseh. Manasseh brings back paganism. And his revitalization of paganism allows Belial also sometimes spelled belly R. Just replacing the last L with an R gives him a chance. We've talked about Belial before. It means sort of the yokeless one. I remember we talked about in some detail in the Antichrist episode about the man of lawlessness. That lawlessness is the maniple isle. But anyway, so Belial means the yokeless one, like the lawless one. So this is a devil figure again in our Second Temple literature. He possesses a pagan prophet. He's able to possess him because this pagan prophet is involved in pagan worship of demons in Israel. And the prophet he produces or who he possesses is named Belkira, which is probably not what his mom named him, because Belkira in Aramaic means lord of evil. Yeah, yeah."}

The old garment that represents this sin and the need for punishment is taken off of you and put on Christ and this perfect robe of Christ's righteousness and merit and goodness is then put on you. Right. In what's sometimes called the great Exchange. Right here we have a real problem with that because not only here do we see this language being used in a Christian text, and it not meaning that at all."}

And if you want direct Bible references to this, remember when St. Paul talks about Christ subjecting all things to the Father, this is how the early Christians understood what it meant when Jesus said, the Father is greater than I. Or when Jesus says, this is life, that they know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom you sent, he is not there denying that he is God. Right. That he is divine. He is there affirming that there is one God, the Father. Right. While also other texts affirm that Jesus Christ is God because he is the express image of the Father, meaning everything that the Father is, He is also God from God. Right. Light from light, true God from true God, all of that Nicene language.

And then after the coming of the Antichrist, you have the resurrection of the dead, you have the last judgment, and then the beginning of the eternal kingdom. Right. So essentially his vision is the gospel. Right. For all intents and purposes, Isaiah sees the gospel in this vision and it's presented that it's wedged in there so that they can say the fact that he had this vision, the fact that Isaiah knew the gospel in advance, that's why Belial came and killed him."}

And so the reason these texts gravitate together is that you have this text just recording Jewish traditions of how Isaiah died. Right, right. And then you have some Christian texts where Isaiah is used as a figure to represent the book of Isaiah and show the connections between that and Christ. Right. What Isaiah prophesied and the death and resurrection of Christ and these other things, the bodily Resurrection, the last judgment, all of this. Right. And so they gravitate to each other. Right. But this happens all the time, even in the New Testament. Right. In the New Testament, it's very common to quote, say Moses says, and then it's just a quote from the Torah. Yeah, right. And sometimes what's being quoted isn't something that Moses said. Like the person, Moses isn't the one who said it. Sometimes it's God who said it. Yeah, right. But if they're quoting the Torah, they'll just say Moses spoke, saying. Right. And sometimes they'll quote psalms that aren't even Psalms of David in the New Testament and say David says. Yeah, yeah, it's because David is a figure is just used to represent the Psalms."}

We have these sources talking about the Assumption of Moses and talking about the Testament of Moses. Maybe this is the same book, you might think, by two different names. Here's a problem. Saint Nikephoros, the confessor of Constantinople, who we've mentioned before on the show, who made in the 9th century when he was the patriarch of Constantinople made a list of books, of books that were publicly read in all the churches, meaning effectively canonical everywhere. Books which were read publicly in some churches but not others, meaning were considered canonical in some Christian communities, but not others. And then books that were to be read privately by everyone's consideration. Right. And these are all texts that were available to him in the library at Constantinople. So it's a very helpful list. Shows us where things were at the 9th century. He not only lists the names of the books, but he lists their length in lines, how many lines of text there are in the work, how long it is. And he has separate listings for the Assumption of Moses and the Testament of Moses with different lengths, like a major difference in length."}

The assumption piece is missing. Right. Now, our side can then respond and say, well, well, actually, if you read the part we have Moses Refers to the fact that his body is about to be assumed up into heaven in what we have.

It seems pre Christian, but also in the text that we have a major portion of, it is sort of recounting the history of Israel. And it kind of goes right up to the first century B.C. right? So no one thinks this is a mystical prophetic text. So it was written after the events it records, right? Because I mean, it goes through the Hasmonean period. It talks about the Maccabean Revolt, the Hasmone. Like it goes right up into the. So normally when you find texts like that, when you see apocalyptic texts used to recount history, it's leading up to the time of writing, right? And so everyone's pretty much in agreement that this text is doing the same thing all those other ones do, right? And so if you take pre Christian plus records events from the first century bc, you get beginning of the first century AD Right? And pretty much everyone agrees Moses, as we mentioned at the end of the second half, Moses is used here to sort of represent the Torah, right? To represent what he wrote, right, in this, in giving this recounting of history. And we should remember that in the Hebrew Scriptures, right, the Old Testament proper, the books from Joshua through second Kings or fourth Kingdoms are referred to as the Deuteronomistic history because they're not objectively describing the history of Israel. They're describing the history of Israel from the perspective of, in particular the book of Deuteronomy, right. And the blessings and cursings that come upon Israel based on their faithfulness or faithlessness regarding the commandments of the Torah. Right? That's the basis. And so this is a similar kind of thing going on, right? This is put into the mouth of the person Moses. But Moses is here representing the Torah, representing that perspective on history. As we mentioned, genre wise, this is a testament. This is Moses speaking to Joshua before he dies. Within the frame story. During that, as I mentioned, he talks about the fact that his body's about to be assumed into heaven. So I mean, that's how part of how we know that, that some version of that was in the piece that's missing, right? He now again, this is the second time. This one's not quite as bad as the angel of the Holy Spirit, but it's not good either. So some scholars have looked at this text and said, oh, look, this text is saying Moses predicted in detail all these things that were going to happen over the next, depending on where you put Moses. Millennium and a half. Millennium and a quarter, right? This text is claiming that the historical Moses knew all these things. Well, if the historical Moses knew all of these things for sure, then that would mean they were all set in stone."}

Because the priesthood became corrupted. And so when the priesthood became corrupted and the worship of Israel became corrupted, that was the first domino with all these other things going wrong. So the evil kings, and from the perspective of this text, the evil kings, the injustice, all the other horrible sin and everything that was going on in Israel was the fruit of the poison tree of the false worship and the corrupted priesthood. So that said, if we're looking at this being written in the early part of the first century A.D. right. It starts to materialize. Okay. Using this historical commentary as a way of commenting on the present time, this is probably directed against the Sadducees, against the current high priest and priests, right. Who control the temple, who are definitely corrupt, who are beyond corrupt. Right. Not only were they collaborating with the Romans to keep their power, we've talked before on the show about how they use the temple tax to. For their family to take possession of 70% of the land in Judea that wasn't owned by the Romans, belonged to the high priestly family, because they confiscated it for back taxes by levying temple taxes that they knew the people couldn't pay. And then they went to work as tenant farmers on what used to be their land. And it wasn't just that it used to be their land, like they used to own it. This was land given by God in the Torah to their families."}

And so then at the end of it, though, or the end of what we have, the end of the Testament part, there is this sort of final prophecy that Moses gives, because, of course, his recounting of what for the author was history is presented as Moses prophesying too.

Okay, who I know you all read everything he's written. And Origen, everyone's favorite non saint, they're the earliest ones in the third century who comment on Jude verse nine and both of them connect this reference to Saint Michael the Devil contesting over the body of Moses to a text they call the Assumption of Moses. Right. So of course our case that that was included in the missing portion of this text is based on our case that this text is the assumption of Moses. Right.

Although, of course, with Moses, I think the assumption is a pretty clear thing. That's the tradition. Right. Even though that part doesn't show up in this text that we just talked about that has that name because parts are missing. But I think the thing that I want to come away with is this notion of the exaltation of the human person. And this, I think is particularly important because of this. And we've talked about this a bunch of times on the show, but I think it bears repeating. And especially from another angle in this case, this idea that Christianity believes that you go to heaven when you die. If. Fill in the blank here, you know, if you're a good person, if you ask Jesus into your heart, if you, you know, whatever it is, right. If you've done the thing, then you go to heaven when you die. Period, End of story. And I know full well that that is not the official teaching of most churches, or definitely not Orthodox, definitely not Catholic, definitely not most Protestants. But it is, however, an extremely common theology that people have really, really common that this is what it means, that this is what the afterlife is about. Right. Heaven or hell when you die. And that's the end. And, oh yeah, oh, by the way, there's going to be a resurrection someday. And I think the Problem is that it's. Even if people do mention that it's a. By the way. Right. That the hope of the resurrection is not the key vector of the way that a lot of people think about the afterlife, the life after this life. Right. And that there is the possibility of bodily assumption. Right. That there is the possibility of bodily ascension. Even though for most of us, certainly bodily ascension is not going to happen to us. Right. Which is being taken up to be with God even while we're still alive in this life, not having died, you know, as Enoch and Elijah did. Right. And even though the bodily assumption that Moses experienced, that the Theotokos experienced, even though that is not going to happen in the same way for most of us, it is actually going to eventually happen for the righteous. And I want to make a disambiguation here, of course, because everyone is going to be raised from the dead, the righteous and the wicked, as Christ says, the righteous to eternal life and the wicked to eternal condemnation or damnation, depending on your translation. So everyone is going to be raised from the dead. Everyone will have their souls and bodies put back together, but the righteous, their bodies will be changed. And that's really what this assumption is about. Assumption into heaven is not about a change of place. Right now, it's depicted visually like the imagery that we have is. Is of a change of place. But it's interesting if you think about the assumption of Moses. Actually, we don't. We don't even have, like, I don't. I don't know, is that even an icon? I mean, I've seen icons actually, of the devil and, and Michael battling over the body of Moses. I've seen that. It's apparently relatively rare, but I have seen icons. A friend of mine who's an iconographer sent me some pictures of that. But you don't get the assumption of Moses in terms of, like a flight up into heaven. Right. And of course, for the Orthodox, the Dormition of the Theotokos is not depicted as a flight up into heaven. Right. And so the imagery is not that. But even if you want to think of it as in terms of like, you know, going from one elevation to another, that's still not the point. It's not about a change of place. This is about, as St. Paul says, being caught up to be with Christ in the clouds, which doesn't mean we're going to all hover up, rapture style, into the air. Sorry, dispensationalists, sorry, everyone who's been affected by that theology, which is bunk. Rapture theology is bunk. What it's interpreting badly is the language in Scripture that human beings, when they are raised from the dead and those who happen to be still living in this life, when the end comes, when the true end comes, that the righteous, their bodies will be changed, they're going to be exalted. We're going to cast off mortality and put on immortality. This is the crowns and garments and thrones that we talked about in the Ascension of Isaiah. That is over and over again in that. That text. And we see that same kind of language in the. In Revelation. We see it in St. Paul, and of course, we have Christ himself saying that humans will become equal to the angels, the righteous will be equal to the angels, the sons of the resurrection will be equal to the angels. That's the destiny of Christians of. That's the destiny of the faithful bodily resurrection. And then this exaltation of the human person, in which we will still certainly have material bodies, but they will be changed. We don't know exactly how, but they will be changed. St. Paul makes the comparison between a seed and a plant, which I think is a great image, because if you've ever planted a seed and then you see the plant that comes, those two things don't look anything like each other, but we know that they're the same thing. It's that seed you put in the ground, broke apart and became that plant. It's the same thing. And even if you were to do like a DNA test on it, you would see that it's the same thing, but it's radically changed. And St. Paul says that the bodies that we have now are like the seed, and the bodies that the faithful will have in the age to come are the plant. And I think seeing that clearly and understanding that clearly puts a shape to our Christian hope that is much more vivid and much more motivating in terms both of trying to live according to the commandments of Christ and also in terms of our evangelistic necessity. It's much more powerful vision of what the life of the age to come is than simply going to heaven when you die. That is a very static, a very flat way of understanding the age to come. And frankly, it's wrong. It's just incorrect, right? Not just technically incorrect, but it's just incorrect. It's just way too limited and reduced and so forth. That the life of the age to come for the faithful is going to be dynamic and active and exalted and glorious. Right? Like part of the value of these apocalyptic visions is we have A glimpse of what the possibilities for human beings really are to take the place of the angels, to be set among the stars. Right. And if that sounds like pagan to you, right. If that sounds like, oh, Greek mythology talked about people being made into constellations, that's not what that meant, but they were, they were correct in the sense that human exaltation to be like the stars, that is to say, like divine beings, that that is a possibility. What the Greeks and all the other pagans who talked about this stuff got wrong was, number one, it's not done through great feats of glory. Right. You're not trying to oppress the gods so that you get to become one of them. And number two, it's actually available to everybody, not just emperors and sons of gods and whatever. It's available to everybody, including the lowest slave, the smallest child, the most abused, stomped on person in the world can become like the stars. And in fact, in fact, they probably have a better shot at it, frankly, than those who are glorious upon the earth. They have a better shot at it. When Christ came, he came as humble. He came as humble and thus showed us the way. So I think the value in looking at texts like these is that they help us to see more clearly what it is that we as humans can be. This is our actual possibility. And the key to getting there is with the grace of God, to be faithful, to repent every day, to follow the commandments, to say, not me, but you, to actually love your neighbor and to worship the Lord Jesus Christ with his Father and the Holy Spirit."}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #094 - 2024-06-13 - The Ascension of Isaiah and the Assumption of Moses","start":11220.48,"end":11893.1,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Yeah. So I want to talk a little bit about picking up what we were talking about at the end of the first half. Long, long time ago. So long we can't remember when talking about intellectual humility, which for some of us at least, I'm including myself in that. Maybe the hardest kind of humility, as I may have said on the show before, I talk a lot like. So I do like this. I do a Bible study, I preach, I talk to people, I teach classes, I do all this stuff. So I remember saying things, but I have trouble very often remembering where and when I said them. So I end up repeating myself a lot in things. But as I may have said on this show in the past, I have, for literally decades now, I have been reading Nietzsche during Lent to help me work on my intellectual humility, to sort of beat my reason over the head for a while and try and force it into submission. I mean, just to Give an example of what I mean by that, like how that would work. You know, Immanuel Kant said, there are these certain things that just have to be true. We have to presuppose them because if they're not true, then sort of logical thought and reason become impossible. And Nietzsche's response to Kant on that point is, who said rational thought and reason were possible? And so it's a way of reminding myself repeatedly that all the things I think I know for sure, I really don't know. And all the things that I think I figured out, I don't really have figured out. And all the things I think I totally comprehend and understand, I don't really understand and don't really comprehend, which is hard to really convince yourself of. That's why I have to keep doing it repeatedly. We especially now. And this isn't just as modern people. This is a very contemporary thing. I'm saying this as somebody in the United States, but I don't think it's all that different in most of the other places where people are going to be listening to this. Have entered an era in which we take X Files and Stone Cold Steve Austin way too seriously. And we don't trust anybody except ourselves. We have an unbelievable amount of trust in ourselves and our own ability to understand things and figure things out and do our own research and find the truth ourselves and get to the bottom of things. But we don't trust anybody else. And if we don't trust anybody else in terms of just other individual humans, once you start getting groups of people together, we trust them even less, if that's possible. And when those groups of people form institutions, we trust them even less than that, if that's possible. And there's a basic problem with that, and that's that we still have to live. We still have to our lives every day. We still have to do things. And you can't actually live like that. I just took a plane flight last week. I'm taking another one this week. I don't want to. I hate flying, but that's another topic. But I think, honestly, if I'm honest with myself, one of the things I don't like about flying that drives me bonkers about it is that when I'm sitting there on a plane, I can't pretend I'm in control of anything. I have to trust this plane that's probably very old and may or may not be well maintained. I have to trust the pilot that he knows what he's doing and has managed to get some sleep. And his co pilot. You know, I have to trust that the maintenance crew did what they were supposed to do, that were properly fueled up, that I don't like it, right when I'm driving in my car. I'm also having to trust in all kinds of things regarding the car and the maintenance that's been done on it and my own attentiveness of that maintenance. But I at least have to give myself the illusion of control because I'm driving. I mean, I'm not controlling all the other motorists on the road, so I'm not really. But I could pretend, can't pretend on the plane because it's more obvious that I'm being forced to trust. And the more we're honest about our lives, the more we realize our lives are more like being on a plane and less like being the commander of our own destiny in every respect. That we constantly have to trust other people, even groups, even institutions, just to function every day. And I think the only way around the various impasses at which we find ourselves community wise is not to continue to deny the fact that we have to trust, but to at the same time become intentional about the fact that we have to trust somebody and become intentional about who we trust. Who do we believe? Usually when people decry the lack of trust in our modern society, they're comparing it to like an imaginary version of post World War II, pre Vietnam War history, at least in the United States, where there was trust in institution and people, quote, unquote, believed science, right? So they're decrying the fact that we don't believe scientists anymore, or that we don't believe newscasters and journalists anymore, or that we didn't, right? Let me be honest. Those probably weren't the best people to trust in the first place, right? But there are institutions and people we can trust. Not because they're perfect, not because they never make mistakes. You can trust God, you can trust Christ, because he'll never make mistakes. But his church is made up of humans. And the clergy is made up of people like me who are sinners and are unreliable and will make mistakes and will have bad days, sometimes give you bad advice. But when you make the decision, this is the other piece. When you make the decision not to trust people and institutions, even institutions that God has established, even people that God has given some level or degree or area of authority, you are directly choosing then, rather than trusting them. Because you got to trust somebody, to trust yourself, to trust your own ability to know and your own ability to understand and Your own ability to work things out. Any confidence you pull away from everyone else is going to go there. If you start to. If you start to lose confidence in yourself without putting it in anyone else, then you're in real trouble because then you can't function at all. But the intellectual humility comes in. In the realizing that I can't trust myself. Remember that thing I just said about being a sinner? That doesn't just apply to the advice I give other people. That applies to my own understanding and my own ability to decide what's right and what's wrong and what I should and shouldn't do and what I should and shouldn't say in a given situation. If you listen to this show, you know, I have no clue what I should and shouldn't say. I think it and I say it for the most part. And so I'm not trustworthy. I'm one of the least trustworthy people I know in that regard, in terms of who I myself can trust. The most untrustworthy in general person I know is probably more trustworthy when it comes to me telling me the truth about who I am and what I do than I am in my own impression of myself. And so it's not just. I know when we talked about this at the end of the first half, there'll probably be people who are saying, you know, there he goes, attacking Protestants. Right. On the issue of trusting the church. Right. But it's not just about that. It's not even primarily about that. It's about things far more basic and where we put our trust. That's why we have spiritual fathers in the Orthodox Church. So before I make an important decision, I can get a second opinion. So when I realize I've messed up, I can get some advice about how to maybe try to start fixing it and not mess up again. At least not the same way. I'll find other ways. It's why we live in a church community and are part of a community. Living in a community, instead of living by yourself and visiting a community, living in a community puts all of these bumpers and barriers and frames around everything you do. That's where you learn, living in a community, what some of the things are at least that you should think and not say, you probably shouldn't think them at all, but you definitely shouldn't say them. Where you can learn the things that you don't do, that's where you learn. Where there are lines that you don't cross."}

But doing that means you have to put some trust in the community and the people around you. You have to enter into that in a trusting way rather than a distrustful way, rather than in a skeptical way. I think that's not only important in how we approach, like, what church should I belong to? Right? Not that that's not. That's super important. But again, more basically, what do I do? How do I live my life? Right? Has to start with trusting the people around me, the people who I care about and who care about me, people I'm in a relationship with. It has to start with not being skeptical of everything they say and do. How do you be skeptical of something someone does? You read all kinds of motives into it that probably aren't there. Speculate. Right? You, rather than assuming everyone is an honest actor, you assume everyone is a bad faith actor. This is where it starts. We have to do that to live. We have to start being intentional about it. And we have to start trusting other people, the people God has put in our lives more than we trust ourselves and our own ability to think things through and our own ability to understand. Because ultimately the truth is Christ. Ultimately the truth is God. God whom we cannot comprehend, God, who we cannot even frame correctly in human words. So in the face of the truth being something we can't understand or comprehend, what we're left with is trust."}
