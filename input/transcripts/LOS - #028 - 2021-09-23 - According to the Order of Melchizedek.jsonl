So this message for this episode is that we're going to be looking at the mysterious figure of Melchizedek. So Abram, who is going to be later called Abraham, meets him in Genesis chapter 14. Melchizedek gets mentioned again in Psalm 110 and then he shows up one more time in the Epistle to the Hebrews in its meditation on the priesthood. But I mean, who is this guy and why does Hebrews link him to Christ? Is he some kind of pre New Testament appearance of the Son of God? What's going on here? You know, so to get us started, we're going to focus on his appearance first in Genesis 14. But we're going to need a little bit of contextual backstory. So what's going on here, Father Stephen?

He has a number of Elamite kings who are vassals of his, whose forces are with him as they're expanding and subjecting the city states of that region to vassalhood and to send tribute to the growing Elamite territory encounters resistance. Several of these cities, including Sodom and Gomorrah, decide that they want to resist and throw off the shackles of Chederlaomer. Now, when we read about the expansion at the beginning of Genesis 14, the people whomer is taking out and displacing as he expands into Canaan are a list of people who we should probably be familiar with already because we've co quoted Deuteronomy 2 a whole bunch of times on this podcast. It's the Girazites and the Hivites and, And the Em And. And the Amalekites. Right. It's all the giant clans."}

But the, the understanding that I would have is the reason why this reading is chosen for the Feast of these Fathers is essentially to say that they're engaging in the same kinds of spiritual battles by virtue of what they're doing in those councils as was happening this specifically spiritual warfare, because it's warfare against demonized, you know, cannibals and so forth, you know, giant clans.

You know, that's the difference. I mean, this to me is a really important point actually, because sometimes when people, when Christians talk about paganism a lot, or even for instance, as I like to do, read pagan mythology, right. The accusation can be one of syncretism because you're suddenly, you're including these stories and these, these beings and so forth and what you're talking about, what you're doing. But that is not the same thing as actually setting up shrines and altars to them and worshiping them. That's actual syncretism. Right.

So I wanted to bring up this question that I know sometimes comes up with regards to Melchizedek because of the apparent. I mean, we've just explained why this is not the case, but the apparent sort of sudden appearance in the middle of an irrelevant narrative, not actually true. And then he sees this priest. He's offering bread and wine. Wow, that's eucharistic. Some people say, oh, is this Jesus? Is this the son of God showing up in the guise of a priest king from the local city? Right. I thought it would be useful just to take a couple minutes and say why. The answer to that is no. So certainly the angel of the Lord. Right. The angel of the Lord or the word of the Lord shows up a bunch of times in the Old Testament. But there's all kinds of ways that that's talked about and ways that this text lets you know that that is Yahweh, the God of Israel. And none of that happens here with. With Melchizedek. Right. For instance, you know, Abram does not offer sacrifice to this man. Right. That's usually. That's one of the things that often happens when the word of the Lord shows up. You know, there's not. He's not called. He's not called Yahweh. Right. He's not. There's no language specifically identifying him as being God. You know, there's not. It's not a vision. You know, all of these ways that tend to indicate that someone is encountering the angel of the Lord are not happening in this case. There's no indication that this is anything but a human person who's coming out and worships the same God as Abram and is the king of this nearby city. Probably a pagan city, weirdly enough. And his family clearly was pagan, given his name, but somehow he worships the one true God. We don't know why. There's no. There's no context for why he is a worshiper of Yahweh. We just simply do not know. But there's also no indication in the text that this is the angel of the Lord. Like all the markers that you would normally look for. None of those are here."}

We also get from this whole story this pattern of doing battle with the giant clans with the spiritual evil and then victory and then the emergence of a king to offer sacrifice. So that pattern is going to play out sort of throughout the Old Testament into the New Testament in ways you could probably immediately see. And we see within the figure of Melchizedek someone who is not a pagan, who is uniting the roles of king and priest in his person. And so he's going to become sort of archetypal for the, you know, the Venn diagram overlap of king and priest theologically in the Old Testament."}

And we, we talked, as you mentioned last time, about this idea that in addition to seed, plural, and this multiplication language that's used in the promises to Abraham, there's also the promise of this unique, singular seed, this unique, singular son.

Right. That's, that's a thing that exists. And that's the first image of that that we get in the Scriptures is Melchizedek. He's the first king who gets any kind of overall positive mention. And so now how does that kingship get connected to this, this singular person? And we, we talked about last time how St. Paul makes this point in Romans 9, that, that you see the singleness first reflected in the line of Abraham, that there is a, an individual line that is going to lead to this ultimate seat. So it's, it's Isaac and not Ishmael who's in that Line. And that's why, as we talked about last time, Isaac becomes sort of the icon for that ultimate, chosen, unique son.

But it then continues after that. Right. And after you get through Jacob or Israel, you now have 12 kids with four different women, where it spreads out even more and these become fathers of the twelve tribes of Israel. And so when the time comes that Jacob or Israel is dying, he's on his deathbed, he gives what is now called his testament. This is the use of testament that's in last will and testament. But this actually we, we find this several times in the Old Testament where someone will be dying and they will sort of give final words to their, their children or other descendants.

And to him shall be the obedience of the peoples, binding his foal to the vine and his donkey's colt to the choice vine. He has washed his garments in wine and his vesture in the blood of grapes. His eyes are darker than wine and his teeth whiter than milk, which, I mean, you know, I'm just imagining hearing this be the last thing my dad says to me. I'd be like, wait, what? Because, like, I don't see how this applies, but I like the scepter stuff. I'm. I'm on board with that, but I don't know about the rest."}

But it's called the Masoretic text because these fellows, the Masoretes, that's who it's named after, were scribes. They went in and put in vowel pointing, right? They put in marks to indicate the correct vowels. And they put in these marginalia, these two sets of the masura, these two sets of marginal notes about the text, right?

Yeah, it's, it's fascinating to me, you know, that, you know, people can say, well, look, the kingdom of heaven is ruled by a king. And then they can kind of conclude from that that that means any kind of kingship must be the right way. But no, actually, lots of kings were clearly unfaithful and get judged by God for their unfaithfulness. And it's because the kind of kingship that they practice was not the sort that God was talking about when he was talking about kingship."}

Which, the reason why that question is a question in case it's not obvious to people, is that in, well, I don't know, most of world history, almost everywhere, no one's Son is their Lord. There's always a relationship. It always goes the other direction. The Son's Lord is his Father. You know, there's never a, you know, you've done good, son. Now you're in charge of me. Like that's never a thing, right? So that's why this question is a question. How could he say that? How could David call him Lord? Even though he's the Son of David, shouldn't David be above him?"}

And so this is testimony that the Son of David is going to be greater than David. Right. The Messiah is something bigger. But part of what Christ is doing there by pushing that rhetorical question in, in that way is, is he is using an interpretation of this text that we also see in the vision of Daniel 7 that we've also talked about before in the podcast, which is this scene where the ancient of days comes to sit on his throne and the thrones, plural are set, right. We have this sort of divine council, right? Judgment scene that takes place at Daniel. That's when the Son of man comes riding on the clouds, right? And the Son of Man is enthroned, right? Well, if the Son of David, if, if the Messiah is this Son of Man, this heavenly Son of Man, well, that would make him greater than David, right? Right. And we have this enthronement scene sit at my right hand. And within Daniel 7, that's in the context of we have these beasts, right? And, and he's enthroned. And then there's this period of time before the beasts are judged, right? So there's this, there's this lapse, right? And so in, in the second verse of Psalm 110, that's referred to, right?

And this is the image, as I say, and this is reflected. I mean, we just, you know, so we're recording this on the Feast of the Exaltation of the Cross on our calendar. That's where we're speaking to you from. So this morning we just celebrated liturgy for the feast, and this kind of thing is reflected all over the Divine Liturgy. But I just thought just now, for instance, about the prayer that gets said right before what's called the little entrance, which in the ancient church would have been the point at which the clergy and the people are really entering into the church. It's not. It wouldn't at the time, it would not have just been the clergy kind of leaving the altar area and then coming back into it real quick. It was really their first entrance into it. And that prayer explicitly asks God to make that entrance, be accompanied by angels. Right. And there's all kinds of references then in the Divine Liturgy to angels serving alongside the celebrant who's there. Right. So. So like you said, there's this image of, you know, the royal court and the king on his throne and so forth. But at the same time, this is the priest, Christ is the priest, and the angelic beings serve alongside him the way that deacons and altar servers do, you know, and indeed that their vestments, those servers, vestments are designed to remind one of angels. Right. That this is all going on, that we still need to do episodes on the Divine Liturgy. We have to. But. But you know that this is all going on there as well. And it's. And it is. You know, mystically speaking, it is the same thing. Both are really the same thing. These are just kind of two different angles of talking about it.

And the idea there is to. It's a pastoral scene of Pete, this final era of perfect peace with the enemies gone within the creation. So Psalm 110 is quoted more than anything else, obviously, because it gives this important span, this important prophetic layout of what's to come. And then once Christ comes, the New Testament authors are then saying, this is what's now arrived. And so they go back to it again and again to characterize the age that's now begun. So over the course of this episode, we've sort of pulled a whole bunch of things together from all over the Old Testament based on how they're used in the New Testament and different things. And we've even pulled in some things from the last episode from Abraham and Isaac. And a lot of times Christians get accused, especially by some of our Jewish friends, rabbinic Jewish friends, and even sometimes by non religious people that we just kind of go to the scriptures, especially the Hebrew scriptures, that just kind of pillage them for stuff that sounds a little bit Christ.

So it's a little long, but please, just, just, just bear with me. So listen this. And concerning what the scripture says, in this year of jubilee, you shall return every one of you to your possession. Leviticus 25:13. And what is also written, and this is the manner of the remission. Every creditor shall remit the claim that is held against a neighbor, not exacting it, of a neighbor who is a member of the community. Because God's remission has been proclaimed. Proclaimed. Deuteronomy 15:2. The interpretation is that it applies to the last days and concerns the captives. Just as Isaiah said to proclaim the jubilee to the captives, Isaiah 61:1. Just as and from the inheritance of Melchizedek. For Melchizedek, who will return them to what is rightfully theirs, he will proclaim to them the jubilee, thereby releasing them from the debt of all their sins. Then the day of atonement shall follow after the 10th Jubilee period, when he shall atone for all the sons of light and the people who are chosen for Melchizedek upon them. For this is the time decreed for the year of Melchizedek's favor. And by his might he will judge God's holy ones, and so establish a righteous kingdom as it is written about him in the Songs. Of David, a God has taken his place in the council of gods. In the midst of gods he holds judgment. Scripture also says about him over it, take your seat in the highest heaven. A God will judge the peoples concerning what Scripture says. How long will you judge unjustly and show partiality with the wicked? The interpretation applies to Belial and the spirits chosen for him because all of them have rebelled, turning from God's precepts and so becoming utterly wicked. Therefore, Melchizedek will thoroughly prosecute the vengeance required by God's statutes. Also he will deliver all the captives from the power of Belial and from the power of all the spirits chosen for him. Allied with him will be all the righteous gods. The visitation is the day of salvation that he has decreed through Isaiah, the prophet, concerning all the captives. Inasmuch as Scripture says, how beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of the messenger who announces peace, who brings good news, who announces salvation, who says to Zion, your God reigns. Isaiah 52:7. This scripture's interpretation. The mountains are the prophets, they who were sent to proclaim God's truth and to prophesy to all Israel. The messengers is the anointed of the Spirit, of whom Daniel spoke after 62 weeks and anointed shall be cut off. Daniel 9:26. The messenger who brings good news, who announces salvation, and is the one of whom it is written to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor, the day of the vengeance of our God, to comfort all who mourn. Isaiah 61:2, the Scriptures interpretation. He is to instruct them about all the periods of history for eternity and in the statutes of the truth, and then dominion that passes from Belial and returns to the sons of light, by the judgment of God, just as it is written concerning him who says to Zion, your God reigns. Isaiah 52:7. Zion is the congregation of all the sons of righteousness who uphold the covenant and turn from walking in the way of the people. Your God is Melchizedek, who would deliver them from the power of Belial concerning what Scripture says, then you shall have the trumpet sounded loud in the seventh month. Leviticus 25:9. Before you go into, you know, talking about this, I just wanted to mention something that I noticed as I was reading it, which I kind of loved. You know, there is this interpretation out there of Psalm 82 saying that this council, this divine council that God stands up in the midst of, is really just human rulers or the rulers of the people of Israel. And I just wanted to point out that here is this, this you Know Judean text from 100 Years before the birth of Christ that explicitly says that this is about God judging the demon Belial and those who are allied to him. I just wanted to point that out. This second Temple Jewish text explicitly says that this is about God judging the fallen, you know, the fallen angels. So just wanted to point that out."}

So it's not us, a posteriori, coming back and pulling all these things together. This was all pulled together beforehand. This is how the Scriptures were understood. Right. By the people who took it seriously and studied it and were reading the, the Hebrew Scriptures at, at the time Nothing new. Very old indeed."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #028 - 2021-09-23 - According to the Order of Melchizedek","start":8443.82,"end":8709.07,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Well, to wrap up this episode about Melchizedek, the thought that I had that to me ties it all together is, you know, it's often the case that a lot of the things that we discuss, that people could take a superficial image of them and kind of walk away and think, okay, you know, a lot of this stuff is a kind of bestiary, right? Like, it's a collection of weird and mysterious and strange things you find in the Bible, you know, and have this kind of antiquarian, exotic, you know, feeling about this stuff. And of course, you know, Melchizedek is one of these kinds of figures. Like, whoa, who is this guy? I mean, this is really strange and mysterious, right? You know, of course, you know, we talk about giants and angels and demons and the various names of fallen angels. And I think that it can be possible for some people to, you know, as the cliche goes, to miss the forest for the trees. Meaning that we can get really caught up in looking at individual figures or stories or whatever it might be, which are, I mean, cool. This is really interesting, fascinating, fascinating stuff. But if it's not finally all being referred back to Christ, then we're not only wasting our time, we actually might be harming ourselves. The Bible is not a collection of ancient texts that you can find weird, cool, mysterious things in. I mean, that's probably literally true on some level, but that's not its point, right? It's not a kind of book of magic spells. It's not, you know, again, it's not a collection of curiosities and things that just sort of titillate the mind, right? It all points towards Christ. And to me, this episode is one of the ones that, I mean, I think we, God willing, we're doing this in every episode, but I love where the last part where we ended on with this text from 100 BC from the Qumran community, talking about Melchizedek as being this messianic, kingly savior figure, right, who's proclaiming release to the captives and rescuing his people from demons. And how it's like, whoa, that is so Christian, right? It's so clearly Christian, and yet this is a hundred years before anyone was or 130 years before anyone was being called a Christian, right? That was not even a term at this period. It's clearly about Christ. You don't even have to. You don't have to stretch it at all to see Christ in that this is about him. And that's the goal of everything that we're doing. On this podcast is to direct people to Jesus Christ, to direct them to worshiping him, to direct them to being faithful to him, to direct them to knowing him better. And I think this particular topic we discussed on this episode is especially about that latter bit. It's about knowing Christ better. When people say, I look at the Old Testament or, and I see Christ everywhere, that's not a stretch. It's not a stretch. That's reality. And so we've looked at one figure from the Old Testament, this image of Melchizedek, who, you know, as far as we know, it's a real person. Abram meets him, but he also, in himself, just as David does, he in himself, is an icon of the one who is to come, the one who is the prophet, the priest, the king, the Messiah, the Savior, the rescuer of captives, the messenger proclaiming the good news, the defeater of the demons. He's an image of all of that, as we heard summarized in this text from the Dead Sea Scrolls. So, again, it all points to Jesus Christ. That's where we should always end up in every single journey that we take. Father."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #028 - 2021-09-23 - According to the Order of Melchizedek","start":8711.95,"end":8989.64,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Yeah, so building off that a little, one of the most basic questions when you start studying the Scriptures seriously is essentially whether the Bible is a thing. And what I mean by that is, obviously, we, of course buy a Bible and it's a book, right? But in actuality, it's a collection of texts across centuries, you know, millennia virtually, that have been touched by countless hands, different authors. And especially when you take into account the fact that modern scholarship, you know, our 19th century German friends, have done everything possible to try to make not just every book of the Bible, but every piece of every book of the Bible look as disparate from every other piece as possible. Whether this collection we have actually constitutes anything, whether it's just put together by habit, whether it's just put together by historical accident, whether there's anything connecting it other than those series of historical accidents. And I think this is a place of differentiation that you can clearly see between the Christian understanding of Scripture and the rabbinic Jewish understanding of Scripture. Because on the Christian side, once you delve deep into the scriptures, and I hope this is what comes out on this show, this is the thing that in. In this show, in this podcast, in. In the Bible studies I do, the thing I most want to try to bring people in touch with is the fact that once you start digging into the scriptures, even a little bit, you start to see that there is this. There are these structures that lie beneath the Scriptures that connect the texts to each other, the different parts of a text to each other that connect the whole. There are ideas, there are realities that the text is an expression of and trying to draw those out. And the interesting thing coming at it as an orthodox Christian is that it doesn't even really matter what canon of the Old Testament you use, whether you're using the, the Hebrew Bible canon, the, the usual Greek collection, usual Sylvanic collection. You can go get yourself an Ethiopian Old Testament, right? With, with the extra dozen books, any of those you take, you will find the same structure, the same themes. You will find the whole thing in all of its parts. When you see the links and tie them together, all pointing toward the one person of Jesus Christ, you could include or exclude first Enoch, you still get the same Christ. You can include or exclude Third Maccabees, you still get the same Christ. It fits. We don't have to go back and cut out pieces of the tradition we've received from our forefathers in the faith. I'm talking about the ones before the coming of Christ. We don't have to go and weed out pieces of that tradition in order to make ours hang together. I don't think you can say that about the rabbinic Jewish view of the Old Testament. I don't think there is a logical internal reason why Ecclesiastes is in and Tobit is out. I don't see any cogent reason for most of those decisions other than. Other than to obscure as much as possible those links and structures and themes that I was just talking about. When we let the tradition we've received since Abraham, right? When we let that speak for itself, all of it orients us toward."}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #028 - 2021-09-23 - According to the Order of Melchizedek","start":8991.88,"end":9094.64,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Holy Trinity, God the Father, Jesus Christ, the Holy Spirit, Yahweh, the God of Israel. All of it orients us toward that. All of it orients us toward who Christ is and what he will do. All of it gives us the same picture of who Christ is and what he will do. All of it gives us the same picture of how we find our salvation, right? So it becomes a unit sort of in and of itself. And that to me is the greatest argument not only for the fact that the Bible is a thing, that the Scriptures are a thing, that they are a cohesive whole, but also that they're a cohesive whole with the whole rest of the orthodox faith, which also speaks with that same voice, same voice that the apostles spoke with, the same voice that Second Temple Jewish teachers spoke with the same voice that the teachers of ancient Israel who were faithful spoke with the same understanding that Abraham had and that Isaac had and that Jacob had and that David had and Saints Peter and Paul had. The fact that we find it in the Scriptures, regardless of our Christian tradition, we find it in our liturgy, regardless of our ancient Christian tradition, shows us that this is not just a construct, this is not just something we built over time, but this is an expression of a deep and eternal reality. So that's what I wanted to focus on here at the end."}
