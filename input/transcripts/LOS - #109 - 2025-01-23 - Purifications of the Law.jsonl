And he will be the light of the nations and the hope of those whose hearts are troubled. All who dwell on the earth will fall down and worship him. And they will praise and bless and celebrate with song the lord of spirits. First Enoch, chapter 48, verses 4 through 5. The modern world doesn't acknowledge, but is nevertheless haunted by spirits but angels, demons and saints. In our time, many yearn to break free of the prison of a flat secular materialism, to see and to know reality as it truly is. What is this spiritual reality like? How do we engage with it? Well, how do we permeate everyday life with spiritual presence? Orthodox Christian priests Father Andrew Stephen Damick and Fr. Stephen DeYoung host this live call in show focused on enchantment in creation, the. The union of the seen and unseen as made by God and experienced by mankind throughout history.

And some, seeing certain prayers or practices of the church that seemed to be informed by this ethos may even decry them as aberrations. Questions inconsistent with the New Testament.

But obviously also this is one of those things that in certain ways gets transformed in other ways, persists in basically the same form more than you might think.

And then there's further. We're not going to go into that now, but see past episodes on the definition of bad definitions of sin that make that even worse mistake. Right. When those get imported. But so the place we have to start in terms of actually understanding it is that there are two different kinds of uncleanness in The Old Testament in the Torah really is where we're starting."}

But that's not all uncleanness in the Torah. Far more common is what we might call ceremonial or ritual uncleanness. And ceremonial or ritual uncleanness is something you contract in a variety of ways that we're going to talk about here in the first half, but that is resolved. Often if you read the Torah, it'll say the person who does this must wash and they're unclean until evening, or sometimes there's a longer period of like seven days of purification, and then they wash and they're clean. This is all resolved by ritual washings, of which there are a lot in the Torah and in the Old Testament and even into Second Temple Judaism."}

And there were separate men and women's for when they're doing this in the nude. Right. Etc. Right. But ceremonial washing is dealing with this kind of ritual uncleanness. Right. And it wasn't that, you know, journeying to Jerusalem was evil. But you're out there on the road, right? And now you're coming into the city and now you're going up to the temple to worship God. And so. Right, you're cleaned. So this is the kind of ceremonial case that has no, it is not a moral category. Yeah, it is not a moral. And we'll see that pretty clearly as we go forward and talk a little more about it. But we have to start with this distinction. Now, moral uncleanness, when you do something, when you actually do something sinful, you do something wicked, you do something evil, and that makes you unclean and therefore unfit to come into the presence of God because of that evil thing you did. That includes ceremonial uncleanness. Meaning that's why in particular you're banned from participating in worship. You are ceremonially or ritually unclean because of that. But ceremonial or ritual uncleanness does not necessarily imply more moral uncleanness. You can be ceremonially unclean. You could be in a state where you need to wash yourself and clean yourself before you go to worship God without having done anything evil. But if you have done something evil, then you also need to be purified before you can go into the presence of God and worship God. So moral uncleanness. We're going to get much more into detail on this, but we'll start by saying is worse because it includes both. Whereas ritual uncleanness does not include moral uncleanness. Moral uncleanness is avoidable, at least in theory. Right. I say in theory because it involves just not sinning. Right. So it is theoretically possible not to commit any given sin, therefore it is theoretically possible to not commit any. Yeah, I'm. I'm not saying I, or anyone I know has done this recently."}

I was thoughtless, I was clueless, I whatever. And I did this horrible thing, but it's not what I set out to do. Yeah, right. Why is that still considered sin?

That's not what I was trying to say, and then just walk away like nothing ever happened. Right. Like, I have to. There's. There's more repentance needed there. So if the effects of our actions constitute sin, we have to repent of them. We have to repair that damage in the same way that if we intend to do those actions that cause harm, we have to repent of them. You don't sort of, oh, I don't have to repent. I don't have to apologize. I don't have to try and fix things because I didn't mean to break it in the first place. Like, yeah, that. That dog don't hunt. So part of this unavoidableness.

And let's look at these, right, Collectively, not just the last one, but what we're talking about here is these things that happen that you can't avoid, right? But for this to enter into the realm of sin, right? This can become a sin issue if you attempt to approach God for worship after doing one of these things without cleansing, without washing, without purifying yourself.

The refusal to clean yourself properly afterwards and the approach to God, then it becomes a sin issue because you've brought uncleanness into the presence of a holy God, right? You failed to consecrate yourself. You failed to set yourself apart before worship. This is the idea of entering into worship, entering into the presence of God in this way that is casual and common and unserious. See Nadab and Abihu and other biblical examples. That's where it becomes a sin issue. But in and of itself, assuming you then take the next step of cleaning yourself and preparing yourself before you come back to worship God after doing these common things, common everyday things. There's not, there's no sin issue here. Now, someone you know who you are, you know exactly who you are is hearing this and saying, actually, I looked up some of those things in the Torah you mentioned, and they say when you re enter the life of the community, you re enter the religious life. When you come back to the tabernacle or to the temple, you have to offer a sin offering. So."}

That means by virtue of being unclean, you've been separated at least partially from the life of the community, from the worship of God for a long time or a short time.

Right. After that long separation. Right. When you have these extended period away periods away, there is this process, and part of that process is at the time that you are away dealing with the things you've done, not all of which were great. And so that's why the sin offering gets incorporated. But ultimately, as we said, and this gets made clear in Leviticus, chapter 7, the only place sin enters is with the person who refuses, who wants to remain in an unclean state and yet approach God in that state."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #109 - 2025-01-23 - Purifications of the Law","start":2755.04,"end":2813,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Yes. So in Leviticus 7, 1921, we read this. Flesh that touches any unclean thing shall not be eaten. It shall be burned up with fire. All who are clean may eat flesh, but the person who eats of the flesh, of the sacrifice, of the Lord's peace offerings, while an uncleanness is on him. That person shall be cut off from his people. And if anyone touches an unclean thing, whether human uncleanness or an unclean beast or any unclean detestable creature, and then eats some flesh from the sacrifice of the Lord's peace offerings, that person shall be cut off from his people. So it's almost like saying, if you're in an excommunicated state and you go and commune, like this would be the kind of the analog of in the church, then you're anathema, like thrown out."}

This saint had to be someone stubborn. Stubborn enough to outshine evil even when confronted with it face to face. But how did St. Maria become a person whom God could inspire, help and guide during such a dark time? How did she wrestle with her own temptations and allow Christ to grow brightly in her soul? Stubborn Love by Rita Thola is one book in three parts written for young people. Her Life tells the story of Mother Maria Skabstova of Paris from birth to death. The first section of the book is accompanied by graphic novel style illustrations to help the young reader imagine her Work, family, and adventures. Her writings comes next, a smattering of some of the notes and thoughts that shaped her. Your life is the final section where the reader is challenged to consider his or her place in the world, using Mother Maria's life and sayings as a springboard for journal entries and also some group study questions to answer. Pray for us, dear Mother Maria. You can find this book at@store.ancient faith.com Again, that is store.ancient faith.com."}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #109 - 2025-01-23 - Purifications of the Law","start":3333.92,"end":3416.48,"speaker":"Georgia Briggs","text":"Hi, fathers. So I've had a question for a long time, kind of multiple questions, but about the impurity of the ritual impurity of a woman after she's given birth and sort of with what's going on when she is. When she comes back to the church and there's a special prayer set and, and some of the language in that prayer sounds to an outsider or to a first timer kind of more like they're dealing with a sin impurity than a ritual impurity. And I don't know if that's a translation issue. And I. Part of my question also kind of. I realized recently that how I've been interpreting, you know, the hymn to the Theotokos without corruption that gave his birth to God, the Word. I've been misinterpreting that for about 10 years now. As, As a sin impurity thing. When I've asked a priest recently and he was saying, well, no, this has to do with her, you know, her physical state and giving birth without physical harm. So could you talk about more what's going on? You know, why, why is there, why is there this prayer for women when they come back? And how can we better understand, you know, what that prayer that the priest says is doing for that woman and making her ready to re. Enter the church."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #109 - 2025-01-23 - Purifications of the Law","start":3417.2,"end":3573.86,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Yeah, I mean, in a lot of ways, I think this is ground zero for a lot of the misunderstandings about ritual impurity as it continues to exist in the orthodox tradition. Like, there are people, I mean, I, you know, I said this at the beginning, but like, there are people who say, oh, we don't do that anymore. Like, and if, you know, if you have prayers that include that, like, that needs to be revised or whatever. And the truth is, of course, that Evkologian prayers, which is the kind of thing that you're talking about, I mean, the ev. Collian includes lots. Like, it's, like, it's all the kinds of prayers that a priest might Say, outside of the context of regular church services, typically, you know, so the efchologion includes this kind of thing and includes, you know, house blessings, et cetera, et cetera. But so there. I mean, there are various prayers that have been used at different times and places for this purpose, but a decent number of them do indeed include language of ritual impurity, you know, cleansing from uncleanness and forgiveness of sins. Right. I mean, that's. That's all there. And there are people that are like, oh, no, you can't. You can't say that. And I think it's because. It's precisely because people are conflating ritual uncleanness with moral uncleanness, you know, Right. As we said in the first half. Right. Like, moral uncleanness includes ritual uncleanness, but ritual uncleanness does not necessarily include moral uncleanness. You know, like. Like we said, you can become ritually unclean by burying your dad, you know, which you're. You're supposed to be doing. So, I mean, I think that, you know, what do the prayers actually do for the woman? And there's actually, there's two sets of prayers going on there in a churching, and this is one of those places where different Orthodox traditions do this a little bit differently. Like, there's the prayers said for the woman when she comes back, and then there are the prayers that are said to church the baby. Generally speaking, in the Russian tradition, the churching of the baby happens only after the baby's been baptized, whereas in, like, Greek and Antiochian, and I'm not sure which else traditions, those prayers happen are explicitly done before baptism, you know. Yeah. So, I mean, what do the prayers do? I mean, they do what they say they do, right? Like, literally. But I mean, the summary, I would."}

But I mean, to summarize it, though, I would say, like, okay, so a woman, when she gives birth, the tradition is that she stays home for 40 days. And it really is about staying home. I've known of some people, it's like, well, I can go everywhere but church. I'm like, I mean, if anyone has."}

I mean, I always told people, and this is just. This is a pastoral call, but it's the tradition that I was given. I always told women that asked me about this kind of thing, because I'm not going around telling them now. This is what you must do. I would say, look, if you're out and about, you know, and especially if you're taking the baby places other than, like, medical appointments. Okay. If you're taking the baby places or whatever, then you should just go ahead and come to church and we'll do the prayers, you know, even if it hasn't been 40 days. I mean, the ideal is to stay home the whole time and, and really, you know, have that time."}

But you still want a prayer to be said. So it's not like, oh, you have to come to confession because you had a baby. No, it's not that. It's okay, you've been out of communion, so let's bring you back into communion. And so therefore, it is about this cleansing from ritual uncleanness, you know."}

You know, in the Russian tradition, it's, you know, you've just been baptized, and so we're offering you to God. That's my best understanding of that anyway. I mean, I certainly have thoughts with regards to, you know. Right. Which is without corruption. There's some translations that says without defilement. I'm like, stop it.

And now I'm about to just tell you what is my. Understand what I was told, actually. So, like, you'll often hear in Antiochian Church in the US More and more you'll hear without corruption, but in previous years you would hear without stain. Without stain. And My under. At least what I was told by an Arabic speaker, which. I am not an Arabic speaker. I know some Arabic, but not much. I was told by an Arabic speaker. Well, the translation in Arabic used to say effectively without corruption. But the Arabic word for corruption that was being used eventually became like a bad word. Like, it's not a. People would snicker, you know, when they heard it in church, because it was like a bad word. It had become. And so they switched it to another word in Arabic, which. Which gets translated then into English as stain, you know. Yeah, yeah. But it's like, well, look, in English, you know, none of these words are bad words, so let's use corruption. Although, of course. Of course, people. People often misunderstand corruption as moral corruption. Like we say, oh, that person's corrupt. But literally what corrupt means is."}

That doesn't fit with our Orthodox theology. So they go digging in the crates to find some, you know, ancient Bulgarian version of the prayer that they can translate in a way that sounds better to them or something. They don't explore why they don't say, oh, that's weird. Why do we do that? And if they did more of, hey, that's odd. Why do we do that then?

And, and also, of course, you know, I mean, just a little bit of spoiler for something a little bit later in the episode. But like, you're supposed to. Clergy are supposed to abstain from marital relations the night before the Divine Liturgy is to be celebrated, you know, so. Yeah. And, you know, like the. The commandments of Saint Basil the Great to priests, which are in the front of a lot of different editions of Liturgicon. And talk about being at peace with everyone. You know, like, there's all kinds of stuff like this that are these kinds of acts of purification. I'll kick it over to Father Stephen for a lot of the rest of this, but I do want to mention, right, like, a lot of these debates about women going behind the altar, it has nothing to do with women's ordination. That's the problem is it's been conflated with that question because, like, there was a point when the empress would go into the altar area to commune and no one was asking whether or not she should be ordained. Like, it had nothing to do with ordination at all. You know, so Father Steven, now Nestorius."}

And so no one has like a right to go back there based on their biological sex or something. Right. People who think they have a right to serve at altar or to be ordained need to read about Korah again in the Book of Numbers. It doesn't go so well for them when he makes that argument."}

So that's fine. And no one else should be back there. Part of the problem too, I guess it's self critical night is a lot of, A lot of actual parishes I've been in are far too casual about the. I've even been guilty of this and I've been trying to crack down on it. Far too casual about the sanctuary in terms of people coming back there to ask questions during the service or slip somebody a note or you know what I mean? Like people coming in and out, people talk, having conversations back there that don't need to be had there, that could be had over the vestry or outside the iconostasis. You know, we were a little casual about it. And the more kind of casual we are about it, the less clear it is to everyone there that this is a holy place. And this going back is, I mean, what we've been saying on this show since it became potentially dangerous. Right. Spiritually and something that should be undertaken with, with, with due reverence. Father Andrew addressed sort of the, the, the preparation aspect for clergy and the, the being clean. I mean, Toshi isn't actually paying us to Advertise their product. I'll take their money."}

Right. You know, vestments clean and in good repair. Right. I mean, that, that, that. That stuff is literally there. Right, right. And so, you know, that that's not something that. I think it's actually clearer in the case of clergy that it sometimes is across the board how that this clean, unclean distinction has been kept. Because, of course, just like in the Old Testament, clergy are called to a higher level of holiness. You wouldn't know it to look at me, but clergy in general are a higher level of holiness than the average layperson. And so that makes it a little more clear we have more things to point to that is obvious to a layperson."}

Like, I do know that, for instance, the prayers, at least in the Russian tradition, for making a reader, actually include the line, you know, reader is the first degree of the priesthood, you know, and with references to the possibility of reaching a higher degree or whatever. But I mean, that's the thing about a lot of these kinds of practices of the church is that we just have the rubrics for doing the thing. There's no, like, marginalia saying, and this is why we do this. Right. But, but, but, yeah. I mean, that is the explanation that makes the most sense to me is just. Is that. And I mean, and honestly, I don't know when the practice of having boys serve in the altar began, but my understanding is that in most of church history was never boys as a grown man. Right."}

We're making what sounds at first like a fine distinction here, but I think you'll see it as we go through this.

And that's what we're going to talk about now here in this second half. And so sort of the archetypal, morally unclean person, the archetypal sinner from the Old Testament as far as Second Temple Judaism is concerned, and we see this reflected in the New Testament is Cain. Cain. And of course, I mean, Cain who killed his brother Abel, not Kwai Chang. Cain who walked the earth in the old days."}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #109 - 2025-01-23 - Purifications of the Law","start":4986.34,"end":5149.46,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"But Cain is this archetypal figure. And as we mentioned before on the show, the word sin occurs first in the story of Cain in Genesis chapter four. So what Adam does is a transgression of God's commandment. And through that, sin comes into the world in Genesis 3. But sin itself is first mentioned and first does something. It sort of first appears as such in the story of Cain when God says to Cain, sin is crouching at your door. Right. It wants to master you. You must master it. We've talked before on the show, but hey, every episode is someone's first. The verb that's translated crouching there and is translated bizarrely in the Greek, is actually an Akkadian word. That's why when they went to translate it into Greek, they didn't know what it meant, because it's not actually a Hebrew word. It's an Akkadian word. And Akkadian was long gone by that, by the third century B.C. in terms of Alexandrian Jewish rabbis and their linguistic knowledge. But that's true. The King James is where we get the crouching. That word is a word that in Akkadian that was used to describe these demons that they believed would crawl out of cracks in the earth and sort of roam the land. And so that's the depiction of sin there as this force. But Cain is not just sort of, oh, he's really bad. He's a really bad guy. He's a really bad guy. And there are consequences. There are consequences of the moral uncleanness that he wallows in as a bad guy. So a good place to go for this. And when I say this, I'm saying this is not right. Obviously, Genesis 4 doesn't lay this out verbatim, but we're talking about, and we're going to be talking about here, the understandings from the Second Temple period, how they're reading the Cain story, and then these understandings are reflected in the New Testament, how they read and understand Cain. How they read and understand Cain, particularly as the morally unclean person."}

And I looked this up, like, apparently some etymologists think that there is a link with agios, which means holy. Not all agree, but apparently that is a reading that some give of the origin of this word. And so, like, if something's accursed, the opposite of pure, like it's sort of permanently kicked out. You know, let him be accursed. You know, anathema. Right. Like, it's just out, out, out. Whereas agyos means holy. It means set apart for, you know, a particular purpose. And so it's like they're both things that are. So both agos and agyos, which even if they're not etymologically related, makes for great pun in Greek. They are sort of like mirror opposites of each other. One is the good way of being set apart and the other is the dark version of being set apart, thrown out, really."}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #109 - 2025-01-23 - Purifications of the Law","start":5843.92,"end":6003.88,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"So Josephus gives an example of a group of priests who murdered another group of priests in the temple. Yeah, that's right. At one point. So they shed blood in. In the temple. Right. And so that makes. Meant that they were permanent, they could never be priests again, they could never serve again. Right. Until their dying day. And Philo talks about how any act of murder or bloodshed makes someone permanently unable to perform sacred functions. A lot of this is drawing on the example of King David, right, Who was not. When he was not allowed to build the temple, he was not allowed to serve in it. He was allowed to build it because of the bloodshed. Right. And these are instances where, I mean, Cain, we have no evidence whatsoever, we have no traditions whatsoever that Cain ever repented, but David certainly did and serves as an example of repentance. But as in David's case, the moral violation, the sin could be forgiven. It's not that God can't forgive the sin, right? But that ritual impurity remains. Right? That ritual impurity remains and is permanent in terms of barring them from certain sacred functions and certain coming to certain closeness with God. That is a permanent sort of state that can be contracted. So the moral uncleanness, the sin involved in moral uncleanness and the level and the depth of that sin sort of changes the nature of the attached ceremonial uncleanness. So the kind of ceremonial uncleanness attached to moral uncleanness is not. We're not just talking about regular ceremonial uncleanness, which is the common thing, right? It's just common. There's no herbatism. This is a sort of consequence of sin. This being barred from that is a consequence of sin. It's. See, it's hard to use English words because, like Sacred and profane originally just meant holy in common, right?"}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #109 - 2025-01-23 - Purifications of the Law","start":6009.32,"end":6159.75,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"And so we have to profane in the sense that we talk about profanity maybe, right? Like that this is something that's incompatible. You have contracted a state that is a permanent state that cannot then come into, into the presence of God, at least in this life. Because in a normal case, right, Our normal case is you go, you sin, you repent and do everything involved with repentance, and then you come and offer sacrifice and you're restored. The sacrifice is really the celebration of the restoration. It's not the repentance itself. And if you don't have the repentance, then the sacrifice is meaningless. Scripture is pretty clear. In fact, God will reject that sacrifice if there's not repentance attached to it. But offering that sacrifice requires ceremonial cleanness. Right. So in most cases, once you've completed the process of repentance, then you can wash and you can become ceremonially clean again, even though you contracted that ceremonial uncleanness through sin. But in these extreme cases, right, because that ritual or ceremonial impurity is permanent in this life. Right. You can't go and offer the sacrifice that would end that period. You remain. So in the way this was understood in the second Temple Jewish world, like by Josephus and Philo, who are talking about this and other authors who are talking about this, is that the person's death, the person dying, is what brings about what we would call absolution. What we in Christian church circles would call absolution. Right. So sort of that moral uncleanness, the end of it, what removes it is the person's physical death. Keep that idea in mind when you read St. Paul saying, talking about handing someone over to Satan for the destruction of their body and the salvation of their soul."}

And so the Church would have to have ways of dealing with that. And so you do this horrific thing. We don't have this that much in the US because the kind of people who do these horrific things usually aren't very religious. You know, Jeffrey Dahmer, not super pious."}

Someone harms a child, they're not allowed to be a Sunday school teacher. Right. This should be obvious. Right. And the fact that you don't make them one doesn't mean you're not. You haven't. They, you're not forgiving. That's not what that means at all. Right. Part of their repentance is accepting the fact that there are going to be certain things they can never do now because of what they've done in the past. Right. Accepting that and working to serve God within those strictures that they've brought upon themselves. That's part of what it means to repent. So the way that ceremonial uncleanness is typically dealt with, as we mentioned in the Torah and the Old Testament as a whole, is through ritual washing. Right. But that's not how you deal with moral uncleanness, for obvious reasons. You go to, you defecate, you touch a dead body, you touch some mildew, okay. You go and you wash. Right. But you kill somebody, you can't just go wash your hands, take a shower, take a good shower, get all the blood off of you. Okay, now we're good. Right? Obviously. Right. And that's a discontinuity, an area of discontinuity between the ritual washings in the mikvot in the Hebrew scriptures and baptism. Because baptism, even beginning with St. John, for the forgiveness of sins, for the remission of sins, is talking about washing away moral and moral ceremonial uncleanness. Right. That's what's getting washed away by baptism. That's part of why it's only done once as opposed to those other ritual washings."}

It's easy to say they're mysteries that we have to take on faith or on the authority of tradition, but that is not how the early Christians understood them. To them and to all ancient people, the idea that physical objects had spiritual power was very intuitive, whereas modern people tend to find this difficult, bizarre or even unchristian. This is because we live in an era shaped by secularism, a way of viewing a world that's incompatible with sacramental thinking. Because secular ideas are at the heart of our culture, modern people tend to think in secular ways without realizing it. Even the most well meaning of us. How then do we live in, but not be of a secular culture? We need to understand the enchanted sacramental way that the early Christians viewed the world world. But we also need to understand secularism. What is it really? Where did it come from? And how does it influence how we think about religion? Journey to Reality Sacramental Life in a Secular Age breaks down these important issues in accessible, non academic language and is an ideal introduction for young readers, catechumens and seekers as well as for any Orthodox Christians who want to deepen their understanding of the sacraments."}

But just to briefly cover a couple things we talked about there to lead into some things we're talking about here. We talked about there how the Day of Atonement was an additional annual ritual, additional to the regular cycle of sin offerings and peace offerings etc that were going on in the tabernacle all the time. Right. So this is an additional thing. And so that that sort of begs the question, well, okay, what sins still needed to be atoned for that wasn't being covered by the sin offerings? Because I thought that's what the sin offerings did. Right."}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #109 - 2025-01-23 - Purifications of the Law","start":6864.23,"end":6956.16,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"And so we talked about how the Day of Atonement is not concerned primarily with the sin per se in the sense that the sin offerings were ultimately the celebration of the end of the period of repentance and the reconciliation and the re entry into the community. But the Day of Atonement was concerned with sort of the taint, the uncleanness left behind by the sins of the people over the course of the year. And that sort of taint or spore that was left behind by the people's sins over the course of the year was especially dangerous within the sanctuary of the tabernacle and was especially dangerous on that day because that is the day that Yahweh, the God of Israel, chose to appear to manifest himself in the holy of holies. And of course, there could be no sin, no uncleanness. Right. In his presence. And so the Day of atonement ritual is a preparatory ritual to purify the sanctuary for that. We also, in that episode, talked about what is basically the topic of my previous dissertation, which again, I'm not going to recap the hundreds of pages, hundreds and hundreds of footnotes for you here, by the way.

Right. Clearly, St. Paul is implying that there are still unclean things from which we need to separate ourselves as Christians. Right. In fact, if you read that whole passage in Second Corinthians 6, St. Paul is arguing from the idea that now we as Christians, our bodies are the temples of the Holy Spirit, and therefore the need for purity in our lives is actually heightened by the presence of the Holy Spirit. We need to be more concerned about purity and being clean and being holy than people did previously who did not have the Holy Spirit dwelling within them. And this, of course, for St. Paul, broadly, has to do with the process of repentance and sacrifice. Sacrifice here being for us the Eucharist. Right. Where this is applied to us."}

Because we live our whole world still in the new Covenant in the New Testament. Today, as Christians, we still live in the world of the common. Right. The common world, the unclean world. And then we come at certain times to approach God, to present ourselves to God. We come to encounter the Holy most often that is at church. Sometimes it is not. Right.

But also, and actually someone just brought this up in the YouTube chat. There's this question. I mean, this is another one of these ground zero things. It's so funny. People always make it about the stuff that women do without talking about that men have a responsibility just as much in this regard. Like, there is still the custom that many women have of, during their time of the month, not receiving Holy Communion.

I mean, I've heard of, of, of. And I think it might be easier to treat women this way because you just know that women, if they're of a certain age, are having their time of the month every month. And so like, oh, look at her, she went to communion six weeks in a row. Like, you know, whereas with men, with, you know, the parallel issues with men, you don't know, like, it's not on a cycle, but. But nonetheless, this is just one of those things. It's like, hello, you do not enforce that upon other people. That is something that each person, you know, in their spiritual discipline and their piety is being worked out with their spiritual father."}

And that's one of the things that when sometimes people are offended by the fact that Holy Communion in the Orthodox Church is reserved for Orthodox Christians. And so they'll say, like, well, why won't you commune me? Or why won't you commune my uncle or whatever? I'll say, look, I want to, but there's some things we need to do first. You are welcome to communion. When you've gone through, when you've done what the members of this community have all done, you know, that's what it is.

{"episode_id":"LOS - #109 - 2025-01-23 - Purifications of the Law","start":7705.17,"end":8008.22,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Yep, yep, yep. Well, here we are at the end of the third half of this episode, Lord of Spirits. This, this topic was actually requested by multiple people in, including me. Like I've, we've, we've talked about it a little bit on previous episodes here and there, but, but I thought it would be a good idea to do like a focused, you know, especially because we have the Feast of the Meeting of the Lord in the temple, as it's called in Orthodox practice. In Western practice it's called the Purification of the Virgin, interestingly enough, or Candlemas is kind of the shorthand, colloquial term because there's a tradition of blessing candles for this upcoming feast. And I love Candlemas, I love this feast where Christ is brought as a 40 day old child to the temple and taken into the arms of Simeon the Righteous, you know, and you see exactly, exactly the practice, I mean, it's from the Torah. But we see this happening with Jesus, with his mother, the Theotokos. And this is exactly our practice in the Orthodox Church is that a mother and her new child come to the door of the church and she is, there are rituals of purification done for her. In Orthodox practice it is that the priest says prayers over her, lays his hand on her head, prays that she would be cleansed, prays that her sins would be forgiven. Not the sin of having a baby, because that's not a sin, but the sins that she just committed by, during her time of being away from church for six weeks so that she can be returned to Holy Communion and then also prayers for the offering of that child to God. Because that's the point. Like we were, we were just saying like that's, that's the point. And so there's so much that we do in the church that's all aimed at this. Like it's for our purification so that we can have this communion with God. I mean, and this is fractally applicable too, right? So that's the highest Greatest, the most central instantiation of that is that we purify ourselves so that we can approach God in communion with Him. But, like, this is also true in our relationships, right? You, you can't have communion with your spouse, with your family, with your friends if there's uncleanness between you, if there's unforgiven, unrepented sins between you, you can't. It's just, it's impaired. And so, I mean, I think this is probably the most obvious in terms of husbands and wives, that the intimacy of husbands and wives, the union of husbands and wives. And I don't just mean the physical union, although it definitely, definitely expresses itself there. It's predicated upon a cleanness between them, a cleanness between them. This life is given to us for repentance, and repentance is not just like, you know, I'm sorry, I'm not going to do it again. I'm going to try to do good things now from now on. Of course, that's, that's all required. But repentance is aimed at intimacy with God. That's, that's what it's aimed at. It's not just so you become a better person, right? Like, what's offered to us is to be sons of the most high, to be equal to angels, to be part of the royal family of God himself, to be adopted into his family. That is what is offered to us. And so all of this repentance, all of this purification, all of this is aimed at getting us ready for that, getting us ready for that. So far from the idea of ritual, uncleanness and purification being left behind in the Old Covenant, having nothing to do with the New Covenant, I would say that really, in many, at least from this angle, it is what everything that we're doing as Christians in the New Covenant is. We're being cleansed. We're being cleansed so that we can have this intimacy, this communion with God. It's a beautiful thing. Father."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #109 - 2025-01-23 - Purifications of the Law","start":8012.14,"end":8224.14,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"So there are a couple of wrong turns I think, that we make in contemporary culture regarding the idea of the holy and the common, or the sacred and the profane, if understood correctly as the holy and the common. One of those comes to us a lot from mostly from certain areas within American evangelicalism, which is not the same thing as Protestantism. And that comes in the form of, I mean, it could sound an awful lot like the aforementioned with the caller Korah, you know, are not all in Israel holy, where it's just sort of, oh, everyone's the same, right? Everything's holy. Every place is holy. God is everywhere, right? And going down that road, what you really end up with is not everyone is holy, but no one is holy. Not every place is holy, but no place is really holy. You kind of license to do what you want, dress how you want, right? And call it church and do whatever, but there's no holy place, there's no holy time, there's no holy people. That's where you end up. And you lose any concept of reverence then, reverence for particular people, reverence for particular places, particular times. You lose any sense of preparation, preparing to meet God or anything. And church just becomes one more common activity, right? That's part of just the common life. In fact, more and more, it just starts to look like all the other aspects of your life. There's less and less difference because again, everything is just common, the other. And sometimes this happens as a reaction, right? Sometimes this happens as a reaction from somebody who was in that world. And now is it a traditional that has more of a sense of the holy. They become Roman Catholic, they become some kind of high church Protestant, they become Orthodox. But this also, you find the same error, actually in a different form in puritanism and pietism. And that is the idea that there is the holy and there is the common, and the holy is good, and the common is somehow bad in that it isn't the holy, right? And this expresses itself again in these various forms. For an Orthodox convert, this may take the form of them kind of desperately wanting to be a monastic, even though they're not a monastic. And even monastics are not actually, as we mentioned, in the church 24 7, they're doing other things. But this person, you know, the only music they will listen to is chant CDs from the church. The only thing they will read is things about the Orthodox Church, although a lot of those things seem to be on social media for some reason, rather than the books, the writings of the Fathers themselves."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #109 - 2025-01-23 - Purifications of the Law","start":8226.94,"end":8227.26,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Right?"}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #109 - 2025-01-23 - Purifications of the Law","start":8227.26,"end":8628.54,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"And they just want to be totally immersed, sort of like in the church 100% of the time, right? And that leads to bad places. A lot of them end up flaring out and leaving the church. They burn out. Other things happen. They cause a lot of trouble in the meantime. In some good cases, they kind of get more balanced as they go. That's what we hope for, right? But the same thing happens in Roman Catholic Church that the high church, Protestant groups of people who do this in the more puritan and pietist form. This is, you know, in the pietist Part of the Dutch reform tradition. I was exposed to this where certain people, you know, you know, while we are not legalists, right. And would never say, you know, xyz, those Baptists are crazy for saying you can't do xyz. Do you really need to go out to eat on a Sunday? Right. It's a different list of rules for everybody, but right. That and the whole. There was also, even in the pietist Dutch tradition, there was a whole worldly amusements thing, right. Like, why are you dancing? Why are you playing cards? Right. And of course, people can see that spread out through the Puritan tradition. Sort of amusing yourself any. Anything entertainment, anything that's just common like that, anything that isn't somehow spiritually directed, right. Is. Is somehow bad. And so whatever you're going to do, if, if you're gonna. If your kid's gonna read a children's book, well, you've got to go and get a Christian children's book from the bookstore. And if they're going to listen to music, you got CD, you got to go. I know nobody uses CDs anymore, but you get my point. You're going to listen to music. Well, it's got to be the Christian version of that music. If you're listening to rock music, it's got to be Christian rock music. If you're going to listen to rap music, it's got to be Christian rap music. Whatever it is, we have to Christianize it because we have to make everything. We have to try to make everything holy. We can't ever be out there in the common world. That's the low church, Protestant form of it, that Puritan form of it. And all of that is a mistake. All that is a mistake. And nothing the scriptures ever called for. Nothing the church ever called for the church. The scriptures have always acknowledged as people, we live out in the common world. And then at certain times, we gather together as families, right? As a whole church community, we gather together to worship God, to enter the presence of God, to draw close to God. And before we do that, we sort of mentally and physically and spiritually prepare ourselves to sort of leave that common world and come into the presence of God. And we do that for a time. And then after we've done that for a time, we don't build tabernacles there. We go back down the mountain and we go back into the common world of everyday life. And we embrace everyday life as also being good. The common is also good. It's okay to watch a movie with your family. It's okay to watch the sports ball on Sunday afternoon after you get home from liturgy, which you didn't skip to watch the sports ball, right? It's okay to play a video game once in a while. It's okay to just read a novel that has no spiritual import whatsoever. It's okay for your kids to imagine and play games and things that aren't directly related to Christianity or the church somehow. It's okay to live a normal life in the world as long as when the time comes, we set that aside, we prepare ourselves, we purify ourselves, and we come again into the presence of God. There's going to come a day where the presence of God is going to completely fill the entire universe and we're going to dwell with him forever. That day will come, but that day is not today. Today we have to pay bills. Today we have to feed ourselves. Today we have to maintain our car. Today we have a thousand other of these common things to do. And doing them isn't bad, it isn't wrong, it isn't a distraction from good things. Right? And I'll finish up with this. A place where we see, this is the way everyone talks about the story of Saints Mary and Martha, because the way you may have heard it in the past is, well, St. Martha, she's going around busy doing all this work, preparing hospitality to receive guests, right? And St. Mary, she's sitting there listening to Jesus. And St. Mary is the good example and St. Martha is the bad example. You should be like St. Mary, not like St. Martha, right? Kind of obviated by the fact that they're both saints. This is because people don't read closely, right? Because what Christ says to St. Martha is that there is one thing needful for her, and that is what St. Mary is doing. He doesn't say there's anything wrong with her. Serving hospitality is good. Hospitality is the right thing to do. Everything that St. Martha was doing was good. But there was one additional thing she needed, and that was at a certain point, having done all of the business of the world, all the meal preparation, all the everything, all the hospitality preparation, the time would come when she needed that one thing, which was to come into the presence of the Lord and come and sit at Jesus feet and listen to him. These things are not opposed to each other. They go together. It's only when they don't go together that there's a problem. Foreign."}
