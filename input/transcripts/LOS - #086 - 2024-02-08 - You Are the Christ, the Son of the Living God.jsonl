And he will be the light of the nations and the hope of those whose hearts are troubled. All who dwell on the earth will fall down and worship him. And they will praise and bless and celebrate with song the lord of spirits. First Enoch, chapter 48, verses 4 through 5. The modern world doesn't acknowledge, but is nevertheless haunted by spirits, angels, demons and saints. In our time, many yearn to break free of the prison of a flat secular materialism, to see and to know reality as it truly is. What is this spiritual reality like? How do we engage with it? Well, how do we permeate everyday life with spiritual presence? Orthodox Christian priests, Father Andrew Stephen Damick and Fr. Stephen DeYoung host this live call in show focused on enchantment in creation. This the union of the seen and unseen as made by God and experienced by mankind throughout history. Welcome to the Lord of Spirits."}

Yeah, yeah. Well, that said, when speaking of Jesus as the Messiah, most people will point to the many Old Testament prophecies of the Messiah, that he fulfilled the acts that he did, which fit with what the prophets foretold. And this is, of course, a good and correct thing to do. Yet such an affirmation may overlook a question we should ask about what is actually happening in the Gospels. What did the people who met Jesus in person mean when they pointed at him and identified him as the Messiah? How did they recognize him to be the Messiah even when he had not yet done most, or in some cases, any of the actions that we now look back on in retrospect and match up with his whole life and ministry? What was it about their experience of him on the ground that made them say, this is the Christ? So, Father Stephen, is this actually just another episode defining what the word Messiah means?"}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #086 - 2024-02-08 - You Are the Christ, the Son of the Living God","start":306.15,"end":409.97,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Like a messiah who's the son of David, who's a king, a messiah who's sort of a priestly messiah who was going to restore the temple and the priesthood to its proper worship, sort of purify it. And the kingly Messiah was more focused on basically getting rid of the Romans, but in a broader sense, removing Israel or Judea from an era of foreign oppressors. Right. To have its own independent kingdom again. So all of that was sort of about, well, what was the messianic expectation when you said the word Messiah to a first century Jewish person? What was in their head? Right. So that was. Yeah, yeah. So I was approaching it from one angle. And the. What we're Doing tonight is coming from a different angle, as you said. So because. Right. When the New Testament authors. And that's including like the authors of the gospels, but also St. Paul, St. James. Right. St. Jude, St. Peter, when they write the documents that become the New Testament, the key claim that every one of those documents is making, that it's based on. The key idea. Right.

Right. And then the skeptical person is going to look at you and say, yeah, that's confirmation bias because he didn't overthrow the Romans. He didn't restore the physical temple. He didn't da da, da, da, da, da, da. Right. So that's not how prophecy works. Right? That's not how. That's not how prophecy works. Jesus does fulfill every prophecy about the Messiah. Right.

And also it's important, sorry, preterists, that they were not saying, oh, hey, that whole Messiah thing, Jesus took care of that, so don't worry about it anymore. Right. And that's part of this incorrect view of prophecy. Like, oh, that prophecy is fulfilled. Okay, forget about it. Okay, it's done. Right. That's not what they meant either because. Because Jesus is the Messiah is what they're saying. Not he was not. He was the Messiah. And therefore this Messiah stuff is over. He is the Messiah. But by saying he is the Messiah, they were also not saying he will be the Messiah. Right? They were not just saying he will be the Messiah. What do I mean by that? Well, we've talked on the show before, in the Messiah episode and elsewhere, that there is within the Hebrew scriptures this idea that the Messiah would come and that the Messiah would return and that there is some period of time in between. Right. That, for example, probably the locus classicus for this is Psalm 110, 109 in the Greek, which, as we've mentioned before on the show probably several times, is the most quoted Old Testament text in the New Testament that talks about the Messiah reigning in the midst of his enemies. Right. The Lord said to my Lord, sit at my right hand till I make your enemies the footstool of your feet. Right. So that there is this period where the Messiah reigns in the midst of his enemies. We talked about the long time in Daniel. There's a bunch of places, and the Messiah ultimately returns to judge the living and the dead. Right. The day of the Lord, the Messiah judges the living and the dead. But they weren't just saying, Jesus is going to be the Messiah when he comes back. They weren't just saying, oh yeah, he didn't do some of that stuff the first time he was here. He's going to do that stuff later when he comes back. Right. That's not what they're saying. They're saying he is the Messiah. And they started saying this about him pretty early on, his disciples, right. St. Peter in particular, before he had died, before he had risen, right. Before they even understood. Right. St. Peter identifies Jesus as the Messiah and then argues with him about whether he's going to die or not. Right. So clearly that element he still doesn't understand, but he's still identifying Jesus as the Messiah for some reason. And so the New Testament texts, whether we're talking about the Gospels that are narrating Jesus life and ministry and then portraying him as the Messiah, or we're talking about, in the epistles that are speaking from a different vantage point, describing, but describing who Jesus is, what he does, what he has done, what he will do, right. They are also framing him as the Messiah. Messiah is his identity."}

These are the same verbs that are used. Right. The same verbs that are used to describe what happens with Israel for the 40 years in the desert, the 40 years in the wilderness, there they were tested. And if you've read your Torah, your Pentateuch, then you know that Israel failed and that whole generation died in the desert. Whereas Jesus has the parallel experience, but succeeds. Right? But succeeds. He is tested, gives glory to God, does not worship other gods. Right. Is dependent on God for food and water, like the manna and the water. Remember Israel grumbled and said they were brought out there to die and all this, Right? So the temptations, quote, unquote, that Jesus deals with from the devil are not random. They are. They're all the things that Israel fell into, Right. In that same experience. Right. But so Jesus re. Embodies that, but successfully, but faithfully to God. Right. We just not that long ago had a theophany episode, right? And we talked about in the hymnography and in the Old Testament readings how Christ passing through the Jordan was connected to Joshua leading the people through the Jordan, which parted in front of them, Right. As they came into the land in order to conquer it. So Christ shares that experience as he comes back into the land. We've talked about. I guess we have to mention giants once per episode. Some people think it's all we ever talk about. So if we don't mention it at least once per episode, like, those people would be proven wrong. And we can't."}

If we look at the historical experience of Israel as it's shown to us in the Hebrew Scriptures in the Old Testament, right. We see that the experience of Israel was also profoundly an experience of suffering, suffering in slavery in Egypt, suffering at the hands of his brothers. Right. We see this kind of literally with Joseph, but right. Later on, you have the Syro Ephraimite war, you have these clashes between. You have the Israelite civil war that's related in the last few chapters of Judges. Right. That you have various persecutions of sort of the remnant, the faithful remnant of Israel gets persecuted by the faithless Israelites, like in the case of the prophet Elijah. Right. You also, of course, have. See Israel suffering at the hands of the foreign nations who attack, who invade, who harass. Right. Who try to conquer. But the key here, right, because of course, we see Christ's experience also as one of the profound suffering, right. Of suffering, rejection, alienation, mocking. Right. Ultimately, well, several attempts at killing him before actually he gets betrayed and suffers and dies. Right. Is that the arc of the Hebrew Scriptures is about Israel suffering because of her sins. The reason the Israelite civil war happens in Judges is because of the idolatry and immorality that Israel has fallen into, where they begin to turn on each other. The division of the kingdom into the northern and southern kingdom is a result of Solomon's S. When the Assyrians come and wipe out the northern kingdom of Israel, it's for their apostasy and idolatry and sinfulness."}

When Babylon comes and conquers Judah and takes them into exile, it's because of their sin. Right. Again and again and again is suffering for Israel suffering for her sins.

He's suffering for Israel's sins. And this embodiment of Israel in this way, in these ways we've been talking about is again part and parcel of why they look at Jesus and say, this is the Messiah because he is Israel, and so he is Israel's Messiah. But this goes even deeper than that. And to kind of get at how deep it goes, or to go a little bit deeper down the rabbit hole or however we want to frame it, we're going to use.

There will be no singing tonight. Okay. So, yes, this is Ezekiel, chapter 37, verses 1 through 14. The hand of the Lord was upon me. And he brought me out in the spirit of the Lord and set me down in the middle of the valley. It was full of bones. And he led me around among them. And behold, there were very many on the surface of the valley. And behold, they were very dry. And he said to me, son of man, can these bones live? And I answered, o Lord God. You know, Then he said to me, prophesy over these bones and say to them, o dry bones, hear the word of the Lord. Thus says the Lord God to these bones. Behold, I will cause breath to enter you, and you shall live. And I will lay sinews upon you and will cause flesh to come upon you and cover you with skin and put breath in you. And you shall live. And you shall know that I am the Lord. So I prophesied as I was commanded. And as I prophesied, there was a sound, Behold, a rattling. And the bones came together, bone to its bone. And I looked, and behold, there were sinews on them. And flesh had come upon them and skin had covered them, but there was no breath in them. Then he said to me, prophesy to the breath. Prophesy, son of man, and say to the breath, thus says the Lord, come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe on these slain that they may live. So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived and stood on their feet an exceedingly great army. Then he said to me, son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel. Behold, they say our bones are dried up and our hope is lost. We are indeed cut off. Therefore I prophesy and say to them, thus says the Lord. Behold, I will open your graves and raise you from your graves, O my people, and I will bring you into the land of Israel. And you shall know that I am the Lord when I open your graves and raise you from your graves, O my people. And I will put my spirit within you and you shall live. And I will place in you your own land, place you in your own land. Then you shall know that I am the Lord. I have spoken and I will do it, declares the Lord.

There could be a remnant of it, but, like, this is not going to actively come back again. And so the imagery that God uses here, of course, is very pointed. Right. It's not just like, oh, it's like you're dead. No. As Israel. Israel was dead. And the promise here is that Israel is going to rise again. Rise from the Dead. This is going to require the miraculous power of God, obviously. Right. God is the one who could do this. The fact that he has there. Then you will know that I am Yahweh. Then you know that I am the one who causes things to be that weren't. Right. Israel is going to be remade. Right. It has died and is going to rise again. One of the sort of curious things that you find in the Gospels and that you find in St. Paul's epistles and in summary of some of the apostles preaching in Acts, even in the New Testament are statements that, you know, Paul goes to a synagogue, St. Paul goes to a synagogue in the book of Acts, and he argues from the Scriptures that the Messiah must die and rise again.

And yes, it's true. It's not just, I mean, it's theologically true. Right. Any theological system that explains everything about God and that you can contain in your human head is wrong and probably heretical, but at least wrong. But it's not just true theologically, it's true of the scriptures. Right. I say this as somebody who got a PhD in this. There is not a point that any human ever reaches where they can say they understand the Scriptures in a comprehensive way. Right. It doesn't happen. Right. It doesn't happen.

I'm not saying that there aren't difficult parts of the Scriptures. Okay. But, you know, a guy stuck in Tulsa, I don't know why I'm picking on Tulsa, but a guy stuck in Tulsa overnight who flips open the Gideon Bible in his hotel room because he can't get to sleep and reads the parable of the Good Samaritan could get the message that he needs to love his neighbor. Yeah, right. That's not like, oh, no, I need to find some church father to explain this to me. Right? You can get it. Right. But at the same time, someone who spent their whole life studying the Scriptures and is now in their 80s can pick up and read the parable of the Good Samaritan and have it strike them in all new ways and interact with their experiences in life in different ways where they learn from it, too. That's how Scripture works. And so in most cases. Right. We'll peel back a meta layer here on Lord of Spirits. Right. Most of our episodes, I want to say all, but who knows, right? There might be one that's different, but most of our episodes are essentially a trajectory, right? A line. We draw a line, a through line through the scriptures on some topic. Right. And through tradition on some topic. But if you think about a sphere, how many possible lines you could have go through that sphere, and none of those lines would be contradicting any of the other ones. Some of them would intersect with each other. Some of them would run parallel to each other for a certain distance."}

If you're just joining us, we are talking about how it is that people who knew Jesus in person realized that he was the Messiah, not just that he had fulfilled a list of things that were prophesied about him in the Old Testament, although of course he did that and is doing that, but how they recognized him as the Messiah. And in the first half we talked about Jesus as embodying or recapitulating Israel and Israel's story.

Not full on review, but revisit a couple of concepts. Right. And that's, you know, we're using the term Torah very deliberately here, rather than other possibilities, in parts, try to break up connotations. So we've talked before on the show about how the word Torah in Hebrew means something like teaching. And that got translated in the third century in the Trans Septuagint, which is a translation of the torah as nomos."}

And then the term law even got kind of devalued in English to the point that now when we hear the word law, even when it's used like in the New Testament, we think of, like, commandments like law or legal codes. Yeah, yeah. And it's very obvious that the Torah includes, for example, the Book of Genesis, which doesn't include any of that, and the narrative portions of Exodus and the narrative portions of the other. The other books of the Torah. Right. And so we're using Torah here because what we're talking about is more than just rules. And that immediately becomes important, that idea that it's not just rules, commandments, laws. When we talk about what it means to fulfill the Torah. Right. And we've talked about in the past, Right. That the way a lot of people use fulfill the law or interpret fulfill the law when it occurs in the New Testament is basically get rid of. Right. So it's used as this weird sort of linguistic ledger domain where Christ says he came not to abolish the law, but to fulfill it. So someone will Say, oh, see, so we don't follow this, that, and the other from the Torah anymore. Right. You say to them, but Christ didn't come to abolish the law. They're like, no, he fulfilled it. And the result is the same. We can ignore it."}

And I should say, by the way, that if you understand this correctly, then you can start to see why it is, for instance, that there are a number of commandments even, and ordinances and specific things that God tells Israel to do in the Torah that are said in the text itself to be forever. Right. This shall be, you know, an ordinance forever. Right. And yet you'd be like, well, wait a minute, nobody's doing that anymore. In what sense is that forever? You know, like, Christians don't do that. Even modern rabbinic Jews don't do that thing, whatever it might be, especially some of the sacrificial stuff. But if you understand how Jesus is the one who embodies and fulfills the Torah, then you start to see why it's forever."}

We have presented is a way of life, a way of being in the world. That's why Nomos was a good translation. Right. So that takes different forms. So in Genesis, in the other narrative material, where we're talking about the lives of people, we're seeing a way of life described narratively and that's described both positively and negatively. Right. So there are positive descriptions of things that conform to that way of life, like Isaac and Rebecca's marriage. Right. There are also descriptions of things that deviate from that way of life, like various incidents of polygamy. And you see in those narratives how that goes wrong. Right. How that goes badly, the fruit and the results that that produces. Right. Both of those are ways of using narrative to describe a correct way of life. Right. You have, on the one hand, exemplars, you have models to follow, on the other hand, you have cautionary tales. Right. This is what happens when you go the other way. And it should go without saying, and I'm sure we've said this on the show before. Right. But a lot of people have problems with this. A lot of our atheist friends have problems with this. Just because the Bible describes something happening, that doesn't mean the Bible is saying that it's good."}

And where Abraham goes wrong, we see both. And we see Abraham grow through those experiences and grow closer to God by following a way of life. Commandments obviously fit into that in a very obvious way. So commandments, mitzvot in Hebrew, give you the fences. So if we're talking about a way of life, a way, we're talking about a road, right?"}

This is the good road that leads to the place you want to go, right? One of the ways that you're kept on the road is if there are established fences. Without fences, without any kind of barriers or markers at the edges of the road, you might have a muddy track. You can't tell is the road continuing this way or that way, right? You might get lost, you might wander off the road. If you have these clear markers of where the edges of the road are, that won't happen. They help keep you on the road. That's how the commandments function, right? They're the borders. They're the edges that you don't want to wander past, right? This is really the same way that theological dogma works in the Orthodox Church. By the way, the word dogma in Greek refers to a boundary marker for somebody's property. So the statements of the ecumenical council are putting in these fences, these markers of the edges. You don't want to go further than this in this direction or further than that in that direction, right? You want to stay within these boundaries that mark off the way of salvation. But this is built on how the Torah structures it, right? And so within those, whether it's. Whether it's commandments, whether it's narrative elements, right? Whatever. Whatever genre we're talking about, what's really being laid out is a way of understanding the world, a way of seeing the world, a way of reasoning about the world. And that's obvious. That obviously includes ethical or moral reasoning. What should I do in this situation? What is the right thing to me? What will. What is the thing to do in this situation that will please God, that will bring me closer to God, but it includes a lot more, right? How do we see other people? How do we see events in the world? How do we understand things that happen to us and that we encounter in our lives? It is this overarching framework of how to see the world, interact with the world, be in the world, travel through the world toward God. And so when we talk about Jesus embodying that, hopefully that idea starts to make a lot more Sense."}

But that's right. But this isn't just, you know, me going on this wacky hebrophile right tack. This is. We've fairly recently, at least as we're doing this live broadcast, celebrated a couple of feasts in the life of the Orthodox Church. The feast of Christ circumcision, and most recently, Christ's presentation in the temple, or the meeting of the Lord in the temple, when he was brought 40 days after his birth to the temple. And if you read any. Any of the hymnography, any of the readings we've been reading, okay, from the Orthodox, Manea, it's all about Christ keeping the Torah. It's all about Jesus keeping the Torah."}

That Jesus is the one who embodies the Torah in this way. So this is not just something, right? That's some weird thing of mine, right? So this carries over, right? I'll go so far as to say this is where most modern people fail to understand St. Paul when he talks about how to live. Now, that part of St. Paul gets marginalized anyway in our modern world, right? There's this whole section of every one of his epistles. It usually follows him saying the word therefore, where he starts talking to people about how to live. And those parts get a lot less emphasis, right? Like after Romans, chapter 11, a lot of people just sort of check out. But for him, this is where he's going with the whole letter, right? And he structures it based on this, based on the way in which Jesus embodied the Torah, right? This is how he understands the Torah relating to the Christian Life. So for St. Paul, there's two ways you can walk, right? And that walk. Language is important because in Jewish circles, already in the first century A.D. when a Pharisee like St. Paul is discussing the way people should live or answering questions as a teacher about the way people should live, as he does at his epistles all the time. Here is what you should do. You should be doing this and not doing that. Right. That whole area of discussion within Judaism was already called halakha."}

So when we see the verb to walk, we don't necessarily Just think of it as a metaphor or something, and we don't make this connection, right? But for him, there are two different ways. And this is picking up on things in Proverbs, right? There's the way of wisdom, the way of foolishness, the way of life, the way of destruction."}

You can walk according to the Spirit and follow the Spirit, meaning capital S, Spirit, the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of God, or you can walk according to the flesh. And if you walk according to the flesh, what that means is that you are living your life in a way where you're seeking to gratify your desires. Lust, gluttony, greed, pride, you name it. Right? That's what you're seeking to gratify. If you're walking according to the Spirit, the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of God, then you're living your life in a way that seeks to please God. But what we see again and again, St. Paul explicitly saying is that he's teaching walking in the way of the spirit as a positive way of living and saying that if you live in this way and you follow the Spirit, then those guardrails from the commandments, it's not that they're not there anymore, Right. But it's that you won't need them. You will stay on the path. You're not going to be bouncing off of them. Right. So he lists the fruits, fruit of the Spirit in Galatians. Love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self control. Right. He says against such things, there is no law. There's no commandment in the Torah that you will violate if your life is filled with those things."}

You know, I think a simile that works here is being a musician, right? So when you, you know, kids, when you're first taking those first piano lessons or you're getting out that clarinet for the first time or whatever it might be, you have to look at the keys and say, okay, when I press this one, it's A. When I press this one, it's B, C sharp, whatever, right? These together is this chord. And so you're thinking about all of it as you go. You're thinking about the structure, you're thinking about the names of everything. You're thinking about the rules. How does this work? What exactly is a key change, all this stuff. But, like, if you were to go up to Miles Davis right after he played some piece of jazz and say, okay, now what exactly were you doing just now? He probably would not have explained it in terms of all the stuff that I just said, because he mastered that a long, long time ago. He just gets up there and he plays. And what comes out is music, right? And in a very real sense, that's how the Torah works, is it functions, as St. Paul puts it, a tutor. It's a teacher. It teaches you how to put all these things together, and then you become the person who can simply do that. And you don't have to be looking up the rules all the time. But until we're really able to play, so to speak, then we do need to have the rules. And, you know, if you make a mistake when you're playing a particular piece of music, you go back and you look at the sheet music and you say, exactly, where did I go wrong? How did I fail here? Right? So even if you do become a decent musician, you still need to be drilled with the rules every so often so that you can gain greater perfection."}

But that the Holy Spirit now dwelling within him would allow him to keep the Torah. And if you have any doubts about how I'm reading St. Paul here, I urge you to read St. John Chrysostom's commentary on Romans where he says the same thing.

Sorry to break it to you, Greeks. Right. He dressed as a Jewish man was supposed to. He presented himself as a Jewish man was supposed to. He ate right as the Torah said one should eat. Right. He kept the whole Torah. So. Right. When he, for example, criticizes the Pharisees for their tassels, he doesn't criticize them for wearing tassels at the edge of their garments. They were supposed to do that in the Torah. He criticized them for making the tassels long and the phylacteries broad and big, meaning doing it in a way that was clearly intended to attract other people's attention and to make you look pious to other people. That's what he criticized. Right. Because that was a hypocritical way of keeping Torah. That's not why God gave the Torah, was so that you could make yourself look really pious to other people and become proud. Right. But yeah, keep that in mind. Right.

We have talked about recently, Christ is the divine Logos and wisdom and proverbs, and all of those are approaching Christology basically sort of top down. So we're talking about the divine person who then is made flesh. Right. And that fact. So we're going to be talking, in a sense, talking about Christology now. Right. The way that Jesus is the Messiah embodies the God of Israel, but we're going to be coming at it from the opposite side. Right. So when the disciples first encountered Jesus, when the people who Jesus preached to first encountered him, the people of Jerusalem first saw him and heard him and encountered him. They encountered him as human. That was their immediate experience."}

I mean, it's interesting to think about. Right. Because sometimes people will say, well, why doesn't God just reveal Himself to me? Why doesn't he just reveal Himself to the world? Like, what's with all the hiding? You know, so you don't die. Yeah, it's so you don't die. I mean, I mean, I get the question. I get it, I get it. You know, seeing is believing and all that, but it really is because we would, we would suffer the consequences. You become responsible for whatever you receive. So God's hiddenness is actually a mercy and it's his patience so that we have time to repent. Right, right. So that's what the veil is about."}

People who are listening to Christ from realizing that he is embodying the God of Israel. And so what do we mean by that other than just an ontological. Like, you're like, okay, yeah, Jesus is God. Well, that's not just what we're saying. Right. Because we're being more particular than that. Right. He embodies the God of Israel, the God who we see in the Hebrew scriptures in the Old Testament.

And so what are some of the elements, right, that characterize the God we see in the Hebrew Scriptures in the Old Testament, that we also see in Jesus. Right. Because Hebrews will say Jesus is the express image of his character. Right. This is it. So what is that character? One of the first elements that's present all through the Hebrew Scriptures, the Old Testament, is the humility of God, which is a strange phrase probably to most people, especially our Calvinist friends, who believe what God is all about is glorifying himself. But in actuality, we see over and over again in the Hebrew scriptures, the Old Testament, the humility of God. We see that over against other gods. Right. When you compare him with. The gods of the nations are always proclaiming their own, are always glorifying themselves, are always proclaiming, you know, how great and how powerful and wonderful they are, sometimes to comedic effect now that no one is worshiping them anymore. When we find the old tablets, there's sort of an Ozymandias thing going on with some of them. But what do we see with the God of Israel, with the true God? He will, for example, identify himself as the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. We hear that all the time. We're used to hearing that God is the God of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob. And we don't think every time God says that to identify himself, he's saying, I am the God of three generations of nomadic Bedouins."}

And living in dirt poverty in Nazareth. Right. His father was basically a day, like St. Joseph was a day laborer who did like fix it jobs for other peasants who were poor to pay him.

This embodying of the God of Israel also ties into what we were talking about in the second half. Not just that Jesus embodies the Torah, but Jesus also teaches it. He is the giver of it, right? And the way that he gives it, the way that he teaches it, the centrality of love in his teaching and his message, which by the way, is also the central theme of the book of Deuteronomy, the fifth book of the Torah, of the Pentateuch, right? Who follows this pattern of God, who gave it in the first place, right? And it's very important, right, that another way in which, related to the Torah, Jesus embodies the God of Israel is that just like at Mount Sinai when the Torah was given through Moses, Moses comes down, reads the book of the Covenant to the people, and the people say, oh, yeah, all that you've said, we're going to do that, yes. And then they do none of that, right? In the same way, Christ comes and lives out and expresses and teaches the Torah and communicates this way of life to people and they reject it. This is the whole arc of the Hebrew scriptures, right? From the narrative portions that show it to the prophets who explain it. This way is God coming, condescending in his humility to love Israel and Israel rejecting him, and God being faithful to Israel and Israel being faithless, right? That's the whole story. That's the story of the Hebrew Scriptures. This is not me insulting Jewish people, right? This is their Bible. This is right?"}

And this way in which the blessings of God get repaid with faithfulness and betrayal in the Old Testament and the teaching and the miracles done by Christ get repaid with rejection and attack, right? And suffering in the life of Jesus as the Messiah, right? This becomes the subject of meditation. A lot of our Holy Week texts, a lot of our Holy Week hymnography is meditating on how this relationship between Jesus and his people mirrors parallels, embodies the relationship between God and his people. And so we've got examples."}

How about that? Yes. Yeah. Just go to church a lot during Holy Week. People just go to church. Just take the week off and go to everything. It's the only way to live anyway. In the service of Royal Hours, which is celebrated on Holy Friday morning. One of the hymns from Royal Hours goes like this. When thou wast led to the cross, O Lord, thou didst say. For what act do ye wish, O Jews, to crucify me? Is it because I have strengthened your cripples? Is it because I raised your dead? As from the sleep, healed the woman of her issue of blood, and showed mercy upon the Canaanitish woman? For what act, O ye Jews, desire ye my death, but ye shall behold him whom ye pierced, O law transgressors, and know that he is Christ. So that's that. That one hymn. And, you know, this is not something that is like. It's not new. There's some people that look at some of these and they're like, whoa, whoa, whoa. But actually, this is just a recapitulation of themes from the Scriptures and again, indeed, from the Old Testament. So. Yeah, yeah. So we're going to give an example from the Old Testament that is the same kind of thing."}

There are lots. This is not the exact same words, but I think you're going to hear the same kind of theme here and with this sort of a similar kind of rhetoric. So this is From Jeremiah, chapter 3, verses 19 through 21. This is God speaking. I thought how I would set you among my sons and give you a pleasant land. This is God speaking to Israel, by the way, a heritage most beauteous of all nations. And I thought you would call me my father and would not turn from following me. Surely as a faithless wife leaves her husband, so you have been faithless to me. O house of Israel, says Yahweh, a voice on the bare heights is heard the weeping and pleading of Israel's sons, because they have perverted their way, they have forgotten the Lord their God. So it's. Again, it's this sort of. As, of course, is typical, especially with Jeremiah, this kind of lamenting, you know, God saying, I did this for you, I did this for you, I did this for you, and yet you turned away, and yet you sinned against me. So it's the exact same kind of rhetoric in both that Holy Week hymn and Then this particular example from Jeremiah, but again, many such cases, both from Holy Week and from the Old Testament."}

But like, there's a very elementary way to know why that's wrong without getting into the. The deeper reason, which is way more interesting, by the way. But the elementary reason is that it should be very clear. The historical context of the events of the Gospels is first century Palestine. There's nothing in those hymns and there's nothing in the Old Testament texts, but particularly there's nothing in those hymns when it's talking about Jesus's passion and death and so forth that is assigning this to some racial group. Right. It's addressed to the people who were there and did those things at the time. And as we have pointed out in the atonement episode, as I recall, you know, and when this has been talked about, you know, blood being on people, you look at the Torah, when blood goes upon people, it's to cleanse them. So that language that's in the Scriptures that sometimes people say, well, that's anti Semitic, you know, his blood be upon us and on our children is actually a prophecy about Christ's atonement, about Christ's cleansing of the world. So it's actually a blessing. Now, is it the case that some people in history have looked at these kinds of texts, whether hymns or stuff in the Scriptures and so forth, and have turned it into actual racist, anti Semitism, hate all Jews everywhere, everywhen? Yes, they have. That is wrong. That is a misreading of the Scriptures. That is a misreading of these hymns. So on its face, it's a misreading. But let's look underneath the face a little bit and see the deeper reason why this is a very wrong way to read this stuff."}

The core of the issue here is, and this is in line with a lot of critiques we've made of liberal theological movements is that you have people of a certain liberal sensibility, and they realize that part of understanding what the scriptures say, the Christian scriptures say, and early Christian hypnography and the church fathers and, and. And part of what that means when we say that Jesus is the Jewish Messiah. Because, by the way, nobody else had a messiah, right?

The second part, right. Of all of those statements, right. It offends their sensibilities, right. To say that about Jewish people. And because the worst thing that can happen to them is for them to appear bad in public or to face some kind of accusation like that they were anti Semitic or something, they decide to go the whole route and just become anti Semitic.

That is the basis for why people reject the kind of language that we've just been reading. You know, if you regard God as sort of the generic God, the Platonic God that's out there somewhere contemplating himself, then the idea that you would inject the specificity of the relationship of God with his people, Israel, that's necessitated then. Right. You have to reject that specificity because does that seem weird that he's the God of only these people? But that is what the scripture says, is that he's the God of Israel. And for him to then be. I mean, there is a sense in which, of course, he is the God of every single person and place and thing in the universe. That is true. But he has also revealed himself as the God of Israel. And that means that his relationship to Israel is different than his relationship to everything else. Which means then if you want that relationship, you have to become part of Israel. Right. Which is what the church is. And I'm sure in a future episode we'll go into some great detail about that relationship. But yeah, you can't escape the Israel stuff. You can't escape the Jewish stuff and be an actual Christian."}

That's antisemitism, folks. The people who want to edit your Holy Week book and take out all the references to the Jews, the people who want to make Christianity not Jewish anymore. They're the anti Semites, okay? They're the ones with the colonial attitude. That's where they've ended up. So don't get confused about that. Right. In their concern for their public reputation, right. And not wanting to be accused of anything or look anti Semitic, they go mask off with their actual anti Semitism. So that rant done, kind of. I'm going to revisit that in my final comments, so get ready. But what we've been talking about in this third half is how Jesus embodies the God of Israel, who's a very particular God, right? The living God, the actual God. But we've done that. Again, we're not saying this is all that's to be said about that. We're not saying any of those things. But this is a way of approaching that from the bottom up. In terms of the people who encountered Jesus and first encountered him as as far as they could initially tell a human, how they came to understand that he embodied Israel's God, how that was part of what led them to identify him as the Messiah."}

Well, just to give my own final thoughts, I'm not going to be throwing out any anti Semitism mic drops. I will leave that to you, my friend. Although I enjoyed it a lot. You know, this episode for me has been very illuminating because one of the core questions in the Gospels that Jesus asks people is who do you say that I am? And it's not like a quiz when he says that to them, like let me see how much Christology you guys got down. So who do you say that I am? And of course the response is, you are the Christ, the son of the living God. You are the Messiah. They recognized that he was the Messiah. And we just spent the last couple hours going over exactly what that means. When St. Peter said that, when anyone else said that, I should mention, by the way, that it was St. Andrew who first introduced St. Peter to Jesus and said the Messiah. Just got to get that in there. So how does that apply for us? Right. It's useful and valuable for us to ask what did people in the first century, in first century Palestine, how did they understand this man that they met? Why did they say that he was the Messiah? Right? How does that apply for us? Because it might come across as some sort of. Well, this is a very interesting intellectual exercise, you know, casting our minds back 2000 years and seeing what they might have seen and try to imagine for ourselves. But you know, now we live in this point where all or most of the prophecies have been fulfilled and so on and so forth. So how does that apply? Right, so here's the thing. For someone to be a Christian means that they have met Christ. It means that they had the experience that St. John talks about at the end of his Gospel where he says, these are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ and that believing you may have life in his name. And of course, as we've said, I don't know how many Thousand times in this podcast, Believing there is not just about agreeing. It's about becoming faithful. So these are written that you may be faithful to Jesus the Christ, and that being faithful, you may have life in his name. That is another way to read that exact same verse. So what does it mean for us to have that meeting with Christ, to become faithful to that revelation of him as the Messiah? Well, it means a lot of different things for different people. And by that, I don't mean, well, you know, whatever it means to you. I don't mean that. I'm not throwing out some kind of theological relativism, but I am saying that people encounter the Lord Jesus Christ in different ways. He reveals Himself to people in different ways. Some people, they enter into the beauty and the worship of the church and they meet God. There's hardly any other way to describe it. They meet him, they meet the Lord Jesus. Some people, they study the Scriptures very closely, and over time, the realization comes upon them and Christ reveals them himself to them through their experience of the Scriptures. Some people receive unconditional love from someone, and let's face it, that is a rarer commodity in this world than it should be, even from family. And in that unconditional love, Christ reveals Himself to them. And for many people, it's some combination of those things or something else, but it's coming upon that truth. And by that, I don't just mean a mental understanding, but the truth. Knowing. Knowing that he is the Christ, that He is the Messiah, that He is the one that we have hoped for. That's how the apostles put it. That's how the apostles put it. And that's the basis for our being Christian, is that we encountered Christ and we found Him. And this is where we're going to follow him, is here in the church, because this is his body. This is where he is. This is where he's revealing Himself. This is where when we say Christ is in our midst, it really is true. Christ is in our midst. And so when we talk about who Jesus is, right? It's not about Christology as some kind of precise theological academic discipline, although it's important to have that precise theological language. But as Father Stephen said earlier, the point of that dogmatic language is to create boundaries past which we don't wander off. The dogmatic language does not encapsulate who the Lord Jesus is, right? It just puts those boundaries around the edge. There is an encounter with the risen Christ, an encounter with Jesus of Nazareth, the Messiah of Israel that each of us has and can have and sometimes begins at one point and unfolds over a lifetime. There's a whole narrative dynamic to it for each one of us. And I'm not talking about some kind of like woo woo spiritual experience, although some people have experiences that probably could be described in that way. That's not what I mean. I'm talking about the revelation of Christ to you. And you know, Father, I've heard you say in the past that someone comes to your parish. I mean, I agree with this. If someone comes to your parish and they want to become orthodox for any reason other than here I meet Christ here, I see Christ here I wish to follow Christ, then it's not time for them yet. Because this is what Christianity is. It's the way of life in which we encounter the Lord Jesus and we follow him and we become more like him and we are incorporated into Him. That's what Christianity is. All the other things that get that sort of fan out from that can be very important and helpful and so on and so forth, but there is a center. And this is what it is. This is why the Gospel is preached. This is why the gospel is that Jesus is the Messiah. That is why that is a central part of that proclamation. This is who he is. This is what he did. This is what he expects from us. And so my hope for this episode is that it will have contributed to those of you who are listening to this, it will have contributed to your vision of Jesus as the Messiah, as the one sent by God, the anointed one sent by God to be the Savior of Israel and the Savior in as much as we are incorporated into Israel of the world and the one who has reclaimed his throne in the heavens and whose kingdom shall have no end. So that's what I have to say about that."}

And that's for a whole pile of reasons. Right. You know, late capitalism, turning us all into consumers, units of consumption, before that it was units of labor, intense individualism. We see our own life as a story and an end in, in and of itself. We don't see ourselves having any real direct connection to our ancestors beyond, you know, the curiosity of going and figuring out our family tree and learning about them, maybe, but we certainly don't see them as sort of living on in us or we don't interpret our personal experience and our personal identity in terms of their experience anymore. What do I mean by that?"}

Of course I do, being A priest every time I celebrate the liturgy. If you read the prayers in the anaphora of the Divine Liturgy, whether we're talking about St. Basil the Great, St. John Chrysostom, what you find is you get a sense of the identity of the people of the community that is praying these prayers and the heritage, it's expressed as an experience of the people there praying them. Sort of parallel to in the way, in Passover. The way Passover was celebrated was we celebrated was that it was not the family saying, this is the day on which our ancestors were brought out of Egypt. Right? It's this is the night when we are brought out of Egypt. We were slaves in Egypt. Us sitting around this table. What you find in the Divine Liturgy, because our Divine Liturgy prayers come from communities that were not primarily, honestly, not even significantly Jewish by that point is you find a reflection of the actual experience of us Gentiles, which is that God called us away and set us free from the worship of idols. That God brought us from idolatry, sexual immorality, violence, all of those things."}

And it's expressed in the prayers as that happening to us who are gathered there, not my distant ancestors, us. And that's a sense of identity and heritage that I don't think is real for a lot of us as Christians anymore. A lot of people balk at it. One of the harshest responses I get from people is when I point out, and someone Greek hears it, that, sorry, Greek folks, I love you, but your ancestors were demon worshipping pederasts. That's what they were. Forget about the democracy stuff."}

Forget the democracy stuff. Forget the other stuff, Right? That was the reality. And then a Jewish guy named Saul of Tarsus showed up, showed up in Athens, he showed up in Corinth, he showed up in Thessaloniki, and he spoke to your ancestors and he told your ancestors about the true and living God, and he told your ancestors about the Jewish Messiah and he explained the Hebrew scriptures translated into Greek for their sake to your ancestors so that they could leave that and be set free from that to worship the true and living God. As Jesus says in St. John's Gospel, salvation is from the Jews. Right? And as I just said to Father Andrew, I'm getting to it, right? While that was happening and the Greeks were starting to become Christians, my ancestors were still painting themselves Blue and dancing around fires and killing and eating their neighboring tribesmen. Okay, so not saying mines were better, right? But eventually, eventually the gospel got up there too, right? To the lowlands. Eventually it got there. I'm also part Greek, by the way. It's a small part. That's what happened. And that's part of who I am and who you are as a gentile Christian. That's part of our story. Our story is a story of getting grafted in, as St. Paul says, to the tree that has Abraham as its root, so that Abraham is the father of many nations, so that Jewish heritage becomes part spiritually of my heritage. But there's this danger, this danger that comes, as we were saying in my previous rant, right, of people who want to de. Particularize the gospel, who want to remove the Jewishness of Christianity. Christianity is Judaism. It is a form of Judaism, not it was. It is Right. Our argument with Rabbinic Judaism is who's right about Judaism? It's not about. It's not two different religions, right? It's who has Judaism. Right? Who has the Torah, right. Who has the Messiah. Right? That's. That's the disagreement."}

The concern that people currently have about not wanting to look anti Semitic or being queasy, right, about disagreeing with Jewish people about their own scriptures needs to be redirected. Needs to be redirected the way St. Paul directed it. Rather than being concerned about how we look, we should be concerned about the salvation of Jewish people. We should long for a day and pray that a day comes when the patriarchate of Jerusalem gets overtaken by waves of Jewish people embracing Jesus as the Messiah and becoming Christians. That should be a day that we hope and pray will come. But what that requires is actual love for Jewish people. Not wanting to justify myself and not appear anti Semitic or hateful or judgmental, not having a condescending attitude toward Jewish people will let them have their religion that requires me to actually love them, to want them to fully embrace the truth of their Messiah, their God, their heritage, their covenants. That's the attitude we see reflected in Christ in St. Paul, in the Scriptures, in the church, in our liturgics. And that's the attitude we need to shift back to having. And the way back to that, I think, comes from re embracing the truth of our heritage. That I was once an idolater. I was once lost in immorality. I was once lost in violence and bloodshed. And then the word came to me about the Jewish Messiah and that person I was died and a new person came into existence. And that new person has Abraham as a father. So those are my final thoughts."}
