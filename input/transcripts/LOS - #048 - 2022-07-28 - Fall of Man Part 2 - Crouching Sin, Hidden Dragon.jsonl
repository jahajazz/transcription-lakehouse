And he will be the light of the nations and the hope of those whose hearts are troubled. All who dwell on the earth will fall down and worship him. And they will praise and bless and celebrate with song the Lord of Spirits the modern world doesn't acknowledge, but is nevertheless haunted by spirits, angels, demons and saints. In our time, many yearn to break free of the prison of a flat secular materialism, to see and to know reality as it truly is. What is this spiritual reality like? How do we engage with it? Well, how do we permeate everyday life with spiritual presence? Orthodox Christian priests Father Andrew Stephen Damick and Fr. Stephen DeYoung host this live call in show focused on enchantment in creation, the union of the seen and unseen as made by God and experienced by mankind throughout history. Welcome to the Lord of Spirits."}

This corruption and sin that has to be destroyed by the Flood. This is sort of the fall. Obviously, he believes the expulsion from paradise happened. Right. Obviously he talks about the Tower of Babel also. But for St. Irenaeus, sort of that, right. This from Genesis 4 through 9, this is the sort of main event. Right. If you read Eusebius of Caesarea's demonstration of the Gospel, he sees the Tower of Babel as the main event. He doesn't deny the expulsion for paradise happened. He doesn't deny any of the events surrounding the Flood. But for him, it's the Tower of Babel, when the nations are divided and the powers of principalities, that for him is the sort of main central event. And so part of how you could tell it's the main central event is that when they come around then to talking about Christ and the Gospel, they're mainly talking about Christ in terms of repairing that one again. He also takes care of the others, but there's one that's sort of the focus."}

And so anybody who wants to bash St. Augustine himself for that stuff doesn't understand how history works. Right. But also, I would add, if you tried to base your whole Christian faith purely on the writings of one church father, any church father, you're going to run into trouble."}

Right. That. That doesn't exist. Right. So, I mean, pick any example out of a hat. If you base your whole faith on St. Gregory of Nyssa, you're going to end up with a distorted view of what Christianity is. Not because there's something wrong with St. Gregory, anything more than there's something wrong with St. Augustine. Right. You could do that with St. John Chrysostom. You could do it with any one church father, and you would end up with a distorted view of Christianity because that's not how Christianity works. You don't, like, pick your favorite personality and decide that he's right about everything. Right. Not to mention the fact that you're going to end up not knowing or saying anything about all the topics that author doesn't address."}

But we're going to go through it because what we do know about Cain right away in Genesis chapter four is important that gets dealt with and treated in certain ways in the New Testament and then also in certain ways in other Second Temple Jewish literature and in certain ways by church fathers and other writers.

He could have used a participle. He could have said, therefore, just as sinning began in the world with one man, Right. If he wanted to talk about, you know, breaking rules and Adam, right.

That sort of as a result of what Adam had done, now the ground was under a curse. Whereas Cain is told, you are cursed from the ground. Right. So instead of the ground being cursed, that from. There's this separation now between Cain and the Earth. Right? And the result of that, for Adam, the result of that in Genesis 3 was that he was going to have to bring forth food from the ground by the sweat of his brow, by hard manual labor. There's going to be thorns and thistles. There's going to be difficulty and struggle for him to bring food out of the earth. With cain in Genesis 4, verse 12, it's not happening, right. He's not going to be able to bring food out of the ground at all. He's going to be unable to farm, unable to sustain himself from the earth.

But the great thing here is 5400 BC works either way. So. So regardless of your view of things, 5400 BC founding of Eridu, it even works for Cain on certain people's timelines. So. Yeah.

And I mean, it's interesting that Cain does show up a lot in other kinds of. I don't want to call it legendary material, but like a lot of stories, for instance, here I'll throw out the obligatory Beowulf reference. Beowulf references Kane, Grendel, the monster, the big monster of the beginning of the story. And suddenly I'm reminded of that Sesame street book called the Monster at the end of this Book. But Beowulf does have a monster at the end of the book, and it's a hidden dragon, but see, there you go. But Grendel is said to be a descendant of Kane. And it also says that Kane is the father of orcs and of all kinds of evil giants and elves. Elves are bad creatures in Beowulf, I'm afraid."}

So Cain is an example of something. He's not just the first, he's also the worst. So one of the places that he's talked about that is in your New Testament, if you are in your Old Testament, if you're Orthodox or Roman Catholic, in your New Testament, if you live in the second century, is in the book of wisdom, in chapter 10, verses three and four."}

But when the unrighteous went away from her, and we should say that her is Wisdom. Right. That's if you read earlier in the chapter, you get that. But when the unrighteous went away from her in his anger he perished also in the fury, wherewith he murdered his brother, for whose cause the earth being drowned with the flood, Wisdom again preserved it and directed the course of the righteous in a piece of wood of small value. That's a really great way of referring to the ark."}

So you notice here, Cain is just referred to as the unrighteous. Right. The unrighteous one. Right. And interestingly, Wisdom wants to note that Cain also perished when in his anger, he murdered his brother. And that's talking about a little bit what we talked about last time, that idea of spiritual death, of being cut off from God, from which then sort of further necrosis sets in and someone perishes physically later on. Right. And then also Cain. And this is going to be one of the major themes in terms of how Cain is seen is that he sort of sets things in motion that will end up causing the flood. Right. The flood of Noah. Because the flood is going to come to purify the creation from humanity. So at the time of the flood, we're at everyone's thought was always evil all the time. Right. Which is worse than me, because some of my thoughts are not evil once in a while at least. But this is always evil all the time. Everything has snowballed up to that point. But that begins with Cain. Right. That begins with Cain allowing himself to be mastered by evil. And so Josephus is going to. He refers, he uses the word panerotetos, which is not the same as Potetos."}

So, okay, so here's Josephus. However, he did not accept of his punishment in order to amendment, but to increase his wickedness. For he only aimed to procure everything that was for his own bodily pleasure, though it obliged him to be injurious to his neighbors. He augmented his household substance with much wealth by rapine and violence. Or rapine, I'm not sure actually how that's usually used. Rapine and violence. He excited his acquaintance to procure pleasure and spoils by robbery. Wow. And became a great leader of men into wicked courses. He also introduced a change in that way of simplicity wherein men lived before and was the author of measures and weights.

Right. And notice the points he makes about Cain. Cain does not repent. Right. So even Josephus sees, based on the way the story is, the way that God speaks to Cain, that even the curse that befalls Cain, just like the curse that befalls his father, was there to drive him to repentance. But Cain does not repent. Right. It was not purely punishment. It was to bring him to repentance. Which he refused. And rather than going, returning in repentance, right. He chooses to pursue all of his own pleasures, right? So he just lets sin take over, Right. Whatever desire comes to him, he allows to control him, and then he leads others into it. But then also you notice he sort of related to the city. This is where Josephus is getting this. This is related to the founding of the city that before this, right, people had lived in this way of simplicity where they lived together, they shared things, right. Everybody contributed what they could to the family, to the community, and. And everyone supported each other for help, which is what Cain could have done, Right.

Figure in the City of God. Right? Because the whole premise. So St. Augustine writes the City of God as the Western Roman Empire is collapsing. And one of his major intellectual contributions there is the idea of the seculum, which is not the same as what we now call secular. But the word siculum in Latin before that had just referred to a period of time. Right. Like an age or an era. Right. And what St. Augustine does is he uses seculum to refer to. And he's mingling some Plato in here, as is his want that there's this realm of becoming. Right. There's this realm of this world that is always shifting and changing. It's always sort of temporally determined and in flux. Right. And that's the seculum, that's the City of Man. And so for him, Genesis 4 is Cain founding the City of Man. And you can read about this in city of God. 15:17 is where he talks about Cain in particular. So there's that world of change, and then over against that, there is the City of God, the new Jerusalem, which is eternal, which is unchanging. And so St. Augustine writes the City of God, which is epically huge. It covers everything in the world. But the thrust is he's trying to. To say to people who literally, their world is crumbling around them."}

Then Adam's having to work the ground. Now they're going out and killing. They're going out and fighting, killing things to feed their own desires.

There is permission given later for people to eat meat. So I'm not saying you have to become a vegan. If you're orthodox, you're vegan like half the year.

For instance, the fountains and rivers and sea and the air and the land and the fire and the light and the sun and moon and stars, in short, the whole heaven. For if inanimate and earthly nature, throwing off the yoke, wars against injury, why may not still rather those natures do so which are of a purer character?

In the first place, he might have received injury from the parts of the world which indeed were made for the advantage of the good, and that they might partake of them, but which nevertheless derive from the wicked no slight degree of revenge. In the second place, it may be that he said this because he was apprehensive of injury from beasts and reptiles, for nature has brought forth these animals with the express object of their being, instruments of vengeance on the wicked. In the third place, some people may imagine that he is speaking with reference to his parents, on whom he had inflicted an unprecedented sorrow and the first evil, which had happened to them before they knew what death was.

There's lots of words for cursed, right? I mean, anathema. Right. That kind of thing in Greek. But this one is about ritual impurity. And it's a particular type of ritual impurity that comes upon a person from sacrilege and murder, often when mixed together. And that sacrilege usually takes the form of the desecration of some sacred space. So both Herodotus and Thucydides use the word to describe people who, for example, massacred people, like massacred priests inside some God's temple. Right. So they defile the God's temple by murdering people. And that means they're now AIOs. Right. They're under a curse. Right. They have this status of being ritually impure. Josephus uses it at a couple of points to describe some massacres that took place in the Jerusalem temple, that everyone involved. One time it was just some Levites who took up arms and killed some people, not in the temple, but that they had contracted sort of this state. And the important part of this is that this kind of cursedness or the ritual impurity part of this, the ritual impurity part of this is not removable."}

There's no sacrifice for it. There's no ritual washing for it. There's nothing for it. Right. You maintain the ritual impurity. That's not the same as saying you can't be forgiven for the sin involved. That doesn't mean there's no repentance. There's no way back. But the state of impurity, of ritual impurity cannot be removed. And there are other places where we see this sort of ritual impurity aspect attached to Cain, one of which is in First John 3, verse 12, back again, where when St. John says that Cain murdered his brother, the word that's used for murdered there is not the normal word. The word that's used for murder there is svadzo, which means literally slaughter. Literally means he slaughtered his brother. But in the Greek Old Testament tradition, that word is used entirely for killing a sacrificial victim. So St. John uses this word in describing Cain and Abel to place what Cain did, it's not just a fratricide, but to place it in this kind of ritual and ritual impurity context."}

Like a state of impurity is not removable and get worried about there's something unforgivable. Did they do it? I'm pretty sure nobody listening has gone and massacred any priests inside of churches.

And you know, and this plays out, right, like there's canons in the church, especially canons having to do with clergy, that if they've done various things, especially if they killed anyone in any way whatsoever, even accidentally, they can't be ordained. And in some cases they have to be removed from the priesthood or the diaconate or episcopacy, whatever the order that they're holding. And it's not that they can't be forgiven, but they can't serve anymore. And I'm reminded of a story and I can't remember what the source of this is. So write in, let us know if you happen to know this one about St. Basil the Great, who you know, as you know, he's a bishop and he's got priests serving in his diocese and one did something and Basil deposed him from the priesthood. I don't remember what it was that this man did. He deposed him from the priesthood. And then sometime later, the two of them are both at the same funeral and this ex priest walks up to the body and prays over it and the man comes back to life. And so then he goes up to Basil and says, so I mean, you see what just happened now, can I please be a priest again? You know, and St. Basil says to him, and now this is the best of my recollection. You can be a saint, but you can't be a priest again. You know, what he did left a mark. And that's just the way that it is. I mean, you can talk about how it's wise to do that because it would scandalize people even if the man was really repentant and so forth. But. But there's this deeper thing going on here, you know, this. This ritual impurity that just can't be washed away again. You can be forgiven. You can become a saint, which is the goal of Christianity, by the way. The goal of Christianity is not to be ordained."}

That's what it's often like, isn't it? It's at the end of our own tether that the miracle happens. It is in our greatest weakness that God's strength is known. It's when we decrease that he can increase. It's in losing our life that we find it. To put it another way, it's in the spot where Saint Morwena falls down exhausted that her spring rises up. It's when the people of God curse Moses in the wilderness and wish themselves back in Egypt that they hear the crack of the staff, the gush of water through the rock. It's when God himself is spat upon and mocked and bleeding and dead that the glorious resurrection is ushered in.

Any spoilers before we go there? Yeah, that's by way of a little review. So there's sort of one more thing to talk about with Cain in terms of First John 3:12. And in a lot of ways this aspect of Cain sort of sums up the rest. Right. And so if last. In the last episode, we kind of ended up talking about theosis, we're now going to talk about the other end of the other genealogy here in terms of Cain. So to start with, we have to quick review. We've talked about this before, but the idea of fatherhood and how that relates to image bearing in the scriptures. Right. And so being the son of something means that you are the image of it or the embodiment of it or the sort of incarnation of it. Right. So if we look at the common examples. Right. Barnabas. Barnabas. He is the son of. And encouragement, or the son of consolation. Right. And what we're saying there is that he is a person who images or who embodies these qualities."}

The son of the Son is the image of the Father. Right. So that's the idea that they're embodying sort of these properties, these qualities. Qualities, these aspects, these things. Destruction in a real way. And this is also true with the sons of God language that we refer to it with angels and humans, and especially with humans. Sons of God means we're imaging God, which we've talked about, as we talked about last time, that sons of God, in the same way that image and likeness sort of were on both ends. Right. Of the.

Born in the usual way, but he became the son of the devil. Right. He became the son of the devil by what he did. Right, right. And this is important to hammer not just because of the kind of wonky theories we started out talking about, but also because a lot of forms of Gnosticism, for example, Right. Divide humanity into. Into like sons of light and sons of darkness. Right. Or sons of God and sons of the devil. And those are like ontological categories. You are born as one or the other. Right, Right. It's like two different species of human that you're either one or the other. It has nothing to do with who you are and what you do. And. Right. So Cain becomes the son of the devil. He's the first one who sort of becomes the son of the devil. Devil. And he does that how? By imaging the devil. Right. By bringing the devil's works into the world, by embodying him, by doing this wickedness, by committing murder, by doing all these things and by teaching them. Right. So not only does he have a demon sort of walking him around, but he's then walking other people. Right. He's passing it on to the next generations."}

They answered him, abraham is our father. Jesus said to them, if you were Abraham's children, you would be doing the works Abraham did. But now you seek to kill me, a man who has told you the truth. That I heard from God. This is not what Abraham did. You are doing the works your father did. They said to him, we were not born of sexual immorality. We have one father, even God. Jesus said to them, if God were your father, you would love me, for I came from God and I am here. I came not of my own accord, but he sent me. Why do you not understand what I say? It is because you cannot bear to hear my word. You are of your father, the devil, and your will is to do your father's desires. He was a murderer from the beginning and does not stand in the truth because there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks out of his own character, for he is a liar and the father of lies. Pretty sharp words there from the Lord."}

Yeah. And so notice here what is it that makes them of their father, the devil. Right. It's not coincidental St. John's also writing this, and that's why the same kind of wording appears, because of what they are doing. Right. Christ says so in verse 41. You are doing the works your father did. That's what makes them. Right. And if they were sons of Abraham, they would be doing the works Abraham did. Right?"}

Right? Does. And so again, this is this, this active imaging. Works both ways, right? Works both ways. And so it working in this bad way, in this negative way, in this way of sin and wickedness is what we've kind of been calling in a makeshift word. Wish we could up with something better, but I don't know what. As demonosis. Right?"}

Anyway, so the demonic powers are in the world promoting sin, this force and sin, the passions that we talked about last time, they make people passive and they take over and they take control.

And then Even in that St. John Chrysostom quote, which we are want to quote in some cases, like with the Nephilim, even become demons, become demonic spirits.

But so this is what we've seen with Cain. Right. The Devil was only partly successful with Adam. Cain is where we see the Devil's plan sort of go through to fruition with a human. Right. This is what he wants. This is what his plan was. This is how he's. He's rebelling against God as creator. And that's if, if God's plan is theosis, if that's God's plan for humanity that made the devil envious, that made him jealous, that made him angry, that filled him with his pride, if that's God's plan, then he is going to make at least some of these humans his imagers instead of God's. His worshipers instead of God's, his followers instead of God's. That's where he's going to try and usurp God is in the lives and the minds and the hearts and the souls and the bodies of, of some of these humans. Not because he just loves humans and Wants some of his own, but to destroy them because he knows God loves them and he hates God."}

So you have the obvious Tower of Babel with the nations, and then Satan offering Jesus the nations and him refusing the worship which, you know, the humanity gave into. And with, of course, Adam and Eve in the apple dealing with God's intent and Jesus with the stone and breads, that is also, you know, him submitting to what God intended instead of doing his own thing, which, of course, leaves the temptation on the Temple Mount and Cain's fall.

Because the issue of throwing himself off of the pinnacle of the temple has to do with trusting in God. Right. Versus testing God. And I think if I was going to try to connect that with Cain, I would Go to after Cain had sinned, Right. And he hears the curse that he's not going to be able to provide for himself. That the correct thing to do would have been for him to repent and rely on God's protection. So, I don't know. Like I said, I can't totally sell it, but that's the direction I would maybe go."}

So, yeah, we're talking about the Devil, sort of his main plan. Right. And so we talked last time about how, right, death gives this our mortality. Right, our death, the end of our life in this world, and therefore our life in this world that's bounded by death, gives us this realm for repentance. And so when we understand that sort of this is what the Devil is about, this is what the Devil's plan is, it casts a new light on the idea of sort of morality and repentance. Right. So a lot of times Christian morality is approached especially in the modern West. Not just the west in general, but the modern west in particular, as Christian morality is trying to get through life without doing too many bad things. And if you do do those bad things, as you invariably will do, at least some, but when you do do them, you repent of them, meaning you ask for forgiveness and then you go on trying not to do it anymore. That is sort of a woefully insufficient view of morality because morality is spiritual warfare. They're not two separate things. For Cain, he didn't have a moral choice to make about whether it was right or wrong to murder his brother. Right, sorry. Immanuel Kant, right? What if everyone murdered their brother? This is untenable, right? That's not how this works. Right. He had this power come upon him. Anger, rage, resentment."}

Whether it's anger, whether it's lust, whether it's your laziness, whether it's resentments, whether it's, you know, irritation, stress, whatever it is. This is across the board, self control. St. James talks about taming your tongue. If we can master ourselves, if we can master the forces that are acting upon us, that is what then allows us to follow Christ and to serve God and to do good. But that's the basis of the ethical or the moral struggle for a Christian. Right. It's resisting the desires, the passions, all of the forces acting upon us, trying to drive us, being tossed to and fro, like St. Paul says, and being able to do and to act and to follow Christ."}

The thought that came to me especially was, as I've mentioned a number of times on this show, I'm the father of four kids. And the other day I actually brought all four of those kids to a candy store, you know, which is not something that we do regularly, but, you know, there was a new candy store. And so we're like, okay, well, we'll give their mother a few minutes by herself, take the kids to a candy store. And you know, naturally, of course, especially the younger kids are, the more they're ready to just grab hold of in the candy store. And a father's job is to say, here's the limit, everybody. I brought you the candy store. I'm not telling you you can't have any candy, but here's the limit. You can have this many or this much, right? And then when we get home, you cannot eat all of it. You may have this much and then save some for tomorrow, right? And this is a normal part of parenting, right? Fathers and mothers both do this. And the thing that occurs to me, especially in light of, especially we were just talking about, about the Christian struggle and morality and so forth, mastering the demonic influence that's attempting to leap upon us and to take hold of us, is that the way that we do that is through these small choices, right? With. With raising children. A lot of what you're trying to teach your children to do is to restrain themselves, to have self restraint. Like, yes, I understand you have a desire for candy. And maybe I did a foolish thing by putting this all in front of you. But also, you know, we're trying to enter into this and to have some restraint. You can have one piece, you can have two pieces. Pieces, you can have three pieces, whatever it might be. But the same is true for us adults, except theoretically, by the time we're out on our own, we're training ourselves. We now have been given the tools by our parents, and we're continuing to get counsel from our spiritual fathers and our spiritual brothers and sisters. Encouragement to restrain ourselves, to master ourselves, to master that desire that comes up within us right now. Candy is a desire that seems kind of small and unimportant, sure. But if you feed yourself as much candy as you want and you give it to yourself every single day, then you are not just teaching yourself that that's okay. You are forming yourself into someone for whom this is the norm. You're forming yourself into someone who simply has a desire and then fulfills it. I see something, I want it. I'm gonna take it, right? And while we don't imagine ourselves to be doing horrifying things like, you know, murder and rape and theft and, you know, whatever else, right. The road there, the road to perdition is gotten there. We get there by many small steps of training ourselves to be that way, right? Almost no one wakes up one day and just suddenly snaps into being someone who just grabs for whatever they desire. They have been transformed in that direction. They've been transformed in that direction. That yes, it's true that the slippery slope argument is a logical fallacy, but it is a spiritual reality. It is a spiritual reality. You gradually head deeper and deeper into sin. And holiness works in the opposite way. You train yourself to have that self restraint. You train yourself to have self sacrifice, to have humility. You know, you engage, if you engage in the little prayers, that is simply daily prayers, morning and evening prayer, right? If you engage in the little bit of fasting that's asked for a couple times a week and then in longer periods at other times, you know, if you, if you engage in these things, what you do then is you gradually build your ability, frankly to become like God. You know, you do the works that he does. And we train ourselves in small ways initially, and then it becomes greater and greater. The Lord said this, right? You've been faithful over a little and now receive much, right? And so if you say to yourself, you know, I don't need to be obedient in this little thing, then what you're training yourself is to be disobedient in great things."}

That's how it always, always goes. And so I think one of the big lessons from the story of Cain comes again from that crouching sin that's at his door that God says is, look, it's going to master you. You got to master it. This is God behaving as a spiritual father to Cain, encouraging him. You're going down the wrong path, sir. You need to come back. And this is what spiritual fathers and mothers and spiritual brothers and sisters do for those that God has brought to them is to say, come back. And so when someone says to you, hey, chill out, restrain yourself, you know, or hey, take a look, just look at where you're going. You got to, don't be like Cain, don't be like Cain. You got to turn back and come back to the Lord and do his works. And so we become truly then, the sons of God. Father Stephen."}

And he pointed out that, you know, the way we look at our lives now has a lot of affinities with how Josephus described Cain living his right. And, you know, it's obvious we can all think about some celebrities with reputations or something. We think of people who are just sort of totally debauched and wicked or violent or, you know, some kind of arch criminal or these kind of things as being that type of person. But there's much more nuanced version that is ultimately a version of the same thing that is how a lot of us live our lives. And that's that, you know, we're not looking for gratification of sort of crass sensual desires all the time. We may not be promiscuous or substance addicted or those kind of things, things, but we're looking to satiate certain desires of our ego and of our pride and, and our desire for even, even a lot of this will be controversial, but, oh well, even a lot of the search for meaning stuff now has an undercurrent of this in it that each of us sort of looks at our individual lives. We say, hey, I have this one life to live. That's what I've got, and I need to make the most of it. And again, most of us aren't crass about it, but we make the most of it because we want to be successful at something. We want to make a name for ourselves. We want to be recognized by others. We want to get our ego stroked. We want sort of money. Money is a measure of that sort of success and that we're doing well and we're doing the right things and we're the right kind of person and we're willing to spend a lot of that money to make ourselves appear publicly, whether we're talking about clothes or whether we're talking about carefully curating our online profiles to give the right impression to everyone of who we are and that we believe and think the right things and, and we're on board with all the right causes and we support the current thing and all of this. We devote all of our time to this. And then at some point along the line, we kind of look and go, hey, I spent my whole life chasing mammon. What's the meaning of all this? None of this really means anything, right? And it never did. And then we go and look for meaning. But what Christopher Lasch pointed out is that that way of living life is very recent. That's not how most people in the history of the world, or even most people in the world today, live their lives. Most people in the history of the world and the world today live their lives, he said, like a thread stretched between their parents and their. That their life is not this individual thing that belongs to them. For them to maximize and curate and invest in such a way that it has an ultimately gratifying shape and result. Their life is a connection between the generation before and the generation after, between the past and the future. And if we approach life less like Cain, and we want to be less like Cain, a good place to start is going to the generation above us, trying to learn from them and what they have to teach us. And that's a whole lot of things. Every day, people pass away with stories and truths and knowledge and experiences that vanish because none of us cared enough to talk to them and learn them and be able to pass them on. And every day, people younger than us struggle to figure out what to do and how to live and where they belong in their communities and in the world, because we don't go to them and pass these things along to them and help guide them into where they need to be. Because what our life is really about is about being a part of something much bigger than ourselves. This is what St. Augustine was getting at in the City of God. What our life is about is contributing our little bit to the history of God's salvation, of his creation, contributing our little bit to the story of the progress of Christ's gospel. And we do that through these little small things that we could all do every day to play our part in our shift in our time on this earth, by being a part of our communities, our families, our church. And when we get plugged in and we're playing that part, the meaning thing, the idea of what our role is, the idea of what we should be doing, those things all immediately start to clarify. They immediately start to clarify when we stop approaching the world and the universe and. And life and Christ as individuals, disconnected and alienated from everything else, and we start approaching everything together. So those are my thoughts."}
