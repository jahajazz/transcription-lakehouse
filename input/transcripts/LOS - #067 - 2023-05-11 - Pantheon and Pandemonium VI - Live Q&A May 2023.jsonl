So I had to super condense this, so I hope I have still managed to make sense of it. So we understand that the cosmos has a proper order and that it's been violated. When sin was introduced, setting aside the fallen angels, when man fell, at least the cosmos got set out of order. God must restore it. Just like God does not lie, he does not go against himself, and he wants it to be what it's supposed to be. And justice, properly understood, is. Is the restoration of that proper order. Now, justice, when it's meted out, begets a kind of consequence, because there's just. There's going to be some aspect of restoring it to proper order that occurs, that is often negative. And it seems that that's just a necessary aspect of it. Would I be, if. Correct me, at any point along this road if I'm wrong. But if it seems to me that God's wrath is really the feltly negative consequence of that justice, of that putting things from out of order back into their proper order. And so since sin brought everything out of order and Christ's sacrifice for us, it seems as though he bears the kind of painful consequence of that. Not entirely. We still have our own consequences. We still pass through fire in the end, whether we're saved or not. But it seems like he bore the brunt of the negative consequence and that in doing so justly, appropriately, the Father makes him judge. And it goes from there to whether he forgives or does not forgive, depending upon his mercies and our repentance. Now, what my issue is is that, and part of this was probably from coming from the Protestant, you know, origins that I had as a Christian. But I hear a lot of negativity about the penal substitution theory and, you know, about the way Protestants view the theories of atonement and all that. And I agree with a large part of that. I think that the critiques are very valid. But it also seems to me that what I just loosely described also fits the penal substitutionary theory. Atonement that Christ did bear the wrath of God, that he did suffer for our sake and kind of take the punishment for our sins in order to save us from it. I have trouble understanding how if we can just leave aside the kind of connotatively negative view that the penal substitution provides us of God, you know, with his fists bald and shaking and stomping his feet and angry and having to hurt something to feel better, that if we could just leave that aside and kind of look past and through the specific legal terms, that that does still describe the process of things being out of order, justice having to be restored or mitigated for things to be restored, there being a negative aspect of that and Christ taking that for us, if we would just partake in his life and then being restored. My question is how in what way does the penal substitution not align with that? If we set aside the negative view of God, we tend to think of with it."}

He's like his name saint here, like Saint Paul. Okay, so, so here's the couple of things that I, I, I would say about what you said. So the, the God's justice, right, is experienced the term wrath is the experience of God's justice by being put right when you're wrong. Right. And so the idea then that Christ is experiencing that doesn't make sense because he's not wrong in any way. Right. But he does experience the consequences of sin. Right. And that's the term where it says he became a curse for us. Because the curse that's in creation is the consequences of. It's the damage that's done by human sin. And, you know, if you recall from Genesis, where God comes to Abraham and they make the covenant and he has Abraham cut those animals in half. Right. And makes this sort of path in between them. You know, this is based on this idea that, you know, when, when this covenant is made that the person walking in between the parts, it's this. It's essentially saying, like, if I break this covenant, then this is the. These are the consequences I'm going to suffer. I'm going to be like these, these split animals if I break the covenant. Right. But what happens when God makes the covenant with Abraham is that he doesn't have Abraham, who is sort of the vassal in this arrangement. He himself walks through it in the form of this burning torch to say that he's going to take upon himself the consequences of the covenant being broken. And so Christ's suffering on the cross is that. That he's receiving the damage that's happening. It's not that God is saying, well, I got to whoop somebody, and it's going to better him than anybody else. So Christ is not being put right because he is righteousness himself, but rather he's suffering the consequences of our sins, you know, because of the way that we put the world out of whack and the, the damage that's done and all that kind of stuff. That's my. That would be the way that I would respond to what you said. I don't know, Father. What? Yeah, what do you got?"}

Because Christ is God. And one of the ways in which this is original Trinitarianism, right, is that the, the persons of the Holy Trinity, the hypostasis share one energy, one activity, right? So you don't have, you can't have the Father's wrath being wrathful at the Son, right? The wrath of God is. The wrath would be the wrath shared by all three persons, right? So you would have to have the Son suffering his own wrath. You would have to, like a certain three initial person on the west coast, separate, like the human body of Christ from the divine Son, right? This creates Christological problems, trinitarian problems, right? That's the biggest issue there. But it also, the other big issue or another big issue is any kind of penal substitution only works if you're a Calvinist or a universalist or you're Karl Barth and you say, porque no los dos, right? Because. Right, because otherwise you have. He would have said it in German, but you have, you have God punishing sins twice otherwise. Because if, if Christ bears the consequences instead of me, but other person, and we're assuming here for the sake of argument that I am saved in the end and another person is going to suffer those consequences of his sin himself in the end, then that would mean that when Christ died, he suffered for my sins and not that other person's. So for Calvinists, that's easy, right? They say, yeah, Christ died for the sins of the elect and that's it, right? Limited atonement. Or if you're a universalist, you could just say, yeah, he died for everybody's right? So nobody goes to hell, right? Nobody suffers God's wrath, right? Everyone is set free from it. But aside from those two options, you get into this really weird sticky territory of, well, you know, you could take like a classical Arminian approach and say, well, God looked down the corridors of time and saw who would of their own free will get saved. And then Christ died for those people's sins because he knew who they would be. But now you've got God inside time and looking into the future, which is weird. And when Calvinists say the only consistent way to be an Arminian is to be an open theist, they're kind of right. So there come to be a lot of issues there. And then the last issue I would point to is that one of the most common SOPs that I see given by orthodox folks to some kind of substitutionary atonement, like they'll say, oh, we believe in substitutionary atonement but not penal substitution. It's like, well, okay, you know, you're trying to you know, be ecumenical in a good way and be, you know, ironic, which I should probably do more of, but I don't think I will."}

So I've been a long time listener, and so I guess this question kind of encompasses a number of different episodes, maybe related to, I guess, the soul and the body, and particularly what it means to be made in the image of God. One thing you said a while back really struck Me, where St. Constantine banned branding on the face because that was the image of Christ on. On all of us. And so what? That kind of got some wheels turning, I guess. And so I was thinking about just what it means to be made in the image of God. I think usually people think about that in terms of the soul, the intellectual soul. But then, I mean, not to go off on a tangent, but I think there is a lot of arguments that could be made about how our physical anatomy is at least reflective of our intellectual soul. So anyway. But then to kind of circle back to something else you talked about. Which like, with iconography of God and Adam in the garden, God is obviously depicted as Christ, right? The way Christ looked at the Incarnation. So anyway, I guess all this kind of leads up to my question being something along the lines of, normally I would have thought that Christ the incarnate Christ looks like we do, because that's just what humans happen to look like. Right. But now I started, I started wondering, what if it's the other way around, right? What if humans, quote unquote, happen to look the way we do? Because in some way you could say that that's what God looks like, and obviously in some way is a big qualifier there. But anyways, wondering what your thoughts were on that."}

The word that's used there. And I don't know if this is true. I'm not a Greek scholar, so, you know, throw me under the bus if you have to. Father Stephen, it's great. Is the, the word that's used there in the Greek is katah. So like, according to, or along the lines of, you know, so let us make man according to our image. And the way that I've read that parsed on some occasions is, well, well, you know, who is the image of God? Well, Christ is the image of, of God. And so the idea then that Christ is in some way the template for humanity. So it's not that humanity looks like a God kind of in general, but that humanity is based on Christ in particular. Right. And so you get a kind of a whole chicken and egg theological issue there. But, but I mean, I, I, I feel like it works, which, I mean, yes, you don't want to start theological comments with the phrase, I feel, but, but hey, it's just a podcast, people. You could just say stuff. Yeah, I mean, that, that makes sense to me because, because, you know, like, the Incarnation, this mystery that we don't understand, that becomes manifest to us at a particular point in time is still trans, historical. And that's why we depict Christ walking in the garden. That's why we depict Christ, you know, in all kinds of situations in the Old Testament."}

So actually, in Romanian, there is a problem, because all these things that I'm going to talk about are translated as law, and you might get easily confused because of that. So I understood what a covenant is and this idea of cutting a covenant, and I find it fascinating. And I want to know that ten Commandments are sort of the central part of the Law of God, of the Torah, because the people of Israel also received commandments apart from them. So we have several instances in the Book of Exodus. For example, in Exodus, chapter 24, before the people are sprinkled with the blood of the covenant, we are told that Moses wrote God's commandments in the Book of the Covenant. And then in Deuteronomy, we have what is called the scroll of the Law, which seems to be the same thing. And this Moses commands the Levites to place at the foot, I think, of the Ark of the Covenant. And I think this is the same book that the kings are required to copy for themselves, to make a copy for the phone themselves. So I would like to know which one, if any of these is the Torah, and if any of this is the book of Deuteronomy, as I have heard before. So what do you think?"}

So there's a bunch of interesting things going on here. Yeah. So the. The Ten Commandments, which is really more like the ten words, that's where we get Decalogue, right. That appears in Exodus 20, and Deuteronomy 5 gets repeated. There is sort of a microcosm of the commandments as a whole. And the way that's expressed is that the typical covenant format that was used for a berit, right, for the kind of covenant that we're talking about had a certain format. It begins with introducing the suzerain, the ruler, the high king, right, Introduces himself, says what he's done, what his accomplishments are. It then lays out the duties and responsibilities of the vassal, and then has the consequences for obedience and disobedience. And so you see that format in the Ten Commandments, right? Starts out, I am Yahweh, your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery, who he is, what he's just done for them. And then he gives the commandments, here's your responsibilities, right? And included in that in several places are those blessings and curses, like, honor your father and your mother so that your days may be long in the land the Lord is giving you. One of the reasons why Deuteronomy is sometimes treated as a separate unit, textual reasons, not weird academic reasons, but textual reasons why Deuteronomy is treated as an independent entity is that the whole book of Deuteronomy follows that same format, including ending with the blessings and curses in chapters 28 through 30. So you have sort of the 10 commands presented as a summary of the whole thing. You then have the whole thing, and then you have devturos, nomos, right? Deuteronomy, the second law, the second Torah, right? Where it's sort of all reiterated again as one. As one unit by Moses and sort of his parting sermon to the people of Israel. So it gets restated in various lengths and various abbreviations repeatedly within the Torah, which is the five books. So in terms of what was put at it, put in the ark of the covenant. Usually people read the tablets and think, in fact, people will even teach the Ten Commandments this way, that, like, the first four were on one tablet, and then the other six were on the other tablet, like God ran out of space or something on the first one. But in actuality, it's two copies of the same thing. We know this from the way covenants of that type were ratified at that time in history. And so normally, when a high king would give a covenant to a vassal, one copy of that covenant would be kept by the king so that he could consult it and know his responsibilities. And the other copy would be taken to the temple of a God and put at the feet of the idol, because that was seen as calling on that God to bear witness to that agreement, right? If it should happen that it would be broken in the future. So in the case of the Covenant at Mount Sinai, both copies are taken and are placed in the Ark of the Covenant, because that is the footstool of the throne of God. So it's at the feet of God. There's no idol, right? But it's at the feet of Yahweh, the God of Israel. And the second copy is held by the king, which is Yahweh, the God of Israel. Then that gets in Deuteronomy, as you mentioned, that gets slightly adapted. Once there is going to be a human king in Israel who is going to be an icon of God and his kingship. He is then to make a copy of that, right? He is to make a copy of that. And so the reason why you've heard that that was just the book of Deuteronomy is that critical scholarship, our 18th and 19th century German friends, of course, believe nothing even remotely vaguely looking anything like any part of the Torah was around when Moses was around, if he even existed from their point of view. And everything was written much later. And so they take the story of Josiah recovering the book of the Law, King Josiah, who's a saint in the Orthodox Church, the story of him recovering the book of the Law, which had been lost, not meaning they didn't know where it was, just meaning nobody was paying any attention to it. The wicked kings before him were ignoring it and didn't care about it when he recovers it. They reinterpreted that story as, oh, no, Josiah made it up. And that version that Josiah made up is the book of Deuteronomy. So that's based on that kind of weird critical theory. Now, the actual evidence, the actual concrete evidence for that doesn't exist. There isn't any."}

The whole. The whole unit. And again, there is zero evidence, zero concrete evidence that the five books of the Torah ever circulated separately. The only reason, the only thing anybody has to pin Deuteronomy being a separate thing on is the fact that it has its own internal structure. But that doesn't mean that it's unrelated, just the fact that it has a certain structure. Genesis also has a certain structure that's different than the structure of the other four books. Genesis is framed around this phrase. This is the book of the generations. Ela Toledot in Hebrew. Right. And the other four books of the Torah don't have. Don't use that as a framing device. That doesn't mean it's unrelated. That just means it's structured a little differently because the contents are a little different. So I hope that gets at what you're asking in terms of what's what with that."}

This one is a bit weirder, but maybe he can answer it. So it has to do with an older video of Jonathan Pageau where he talked about the existence of Santa Claus and Tooth Fairy. So basically, he said that Santa exists because we talk about him, because people dress up like him. And there are stories, there are movies, songs, decorations, and all these things about him, so we know what he does and what his role is. So he said that, for example, the people who dress up like him and act like Santa in a mall, for example, talking to kids, these people are parts or extensions of his being or of his body. And I thought about this idea of body as an axis of powers. And I'm curious if basically these people are his power, let's say."}

I've watched. I've watched that video. I can't answer for Jonathan Pageau, but my understanding of what he's trying to do with that is essentially to make a phenomenological argument, you know, that people are experiencing this phenomenon called Santa Claus, and they're experiencing it through, you know, a guy in a mall or whatever else, Right? Or they're experiencing it through someone answering their mail, or they're experiencing it through presents that show up under the Christmas tree that are said to be from Santa Claus. Right? And, you know, that's a real experience, and people do group that together as being an experience. Now, certainly, there's different ways in which people experience that. You know, a kid who's been told there is this man who's going to show up at our house in the middle of the night and come through the chimney and leave prisons and is experiencing it differently than the dad who is reluctantly bringing his kids to see the mall Santa because they asked for that, you know, but nonetheless, there is this. This common experience that people are having, right? And then to say, well, he doesn't exist, is essentially to say that there is no experience. But that's not true. There clearly is an experience. That's my understanding of what the argument that, that Jonathan Pageau is making. I mean, honestly, I'm much more comfortable just talking about St Nicholas of Myra, who exists in all the ways that are much easier to talk about. But it may be that on some level the love and the kindness of the Saint is in some way being participated in through this other phenomenon."}

And you referenced it several times during this show. And it really pained me that Father Stephen said that the canon in Star wars doesn't really matter because it's. It's fictional. But I thought it all happened a long time ago in a galaxy. But the idea is that if we can have this phenomenological experience of Santa Claus, for example, can't we say the same thing, for example, about Luke Skywalker? Because there are stories about him, people, cosplayers, impersonate him, you can talk to him, basically. So what exactly is the difference? Is it the fact that Santa is based on St. Nicholas and the other one is based on anyone? What is the difference between a fictional character who is impersonated by someone and something like Santa Claus?"}

I have the impression that this is a place where I disagree with him, which may or may not be true, because like I said, I haven't talked about it with him. Right. So like I watch a video of his, I say what I think about it, and that's sort of two halves of a conversation, but it's not an actual conversation. Right. And I think it's because if I'm correct in my read of what he's saying. Right. It seems to Me that he is treating, for example, Santa Claus as a spirit."}

And the difference between a concept and a spirit, the way I'm using it, is that a spirit has agency and a concept doesn't. And so I think that distinction is where potentially he. And I disagree because I don't think that a concept like Santa Claus or Luke Skywalker or Captain James Tiberius Kirk, as opposed to the person of William Shatner, the greatest man alive, Right. I think they exist as concept, but I don't think they have any agency. I don't think they can act. I don't think they can produce effects. Yeah, they exist as ideas. So I would agree that Santa Claus exists, but I have the impression, and again, I could be reading this wrong. I'd have to talk to him about it directly or. Hey, Jonathan, if you're listening right now live, call in. But that, I think would be the distinction for me. So, yes, I would say Luke Skywalker exists as a concept, but I don't think the concept Luke Skywalker has agency to affect things in the actual world. I think the concept of Santa Claus or Luke Skywalker, I think what a concept does is a concept is used instrumentally by people. So the agent would be me, and I would take the concept of Luke Skywalker or the concept of Santa Claus and use that. I would use that instrumentally to produce certain effects, right? So I would dress up like Santa, right, In order to use that Persona as an instrument to accomplish certain things in the world. But I would not be embodying an existent spirit of Santa Claus and having that spirit operate through me. That's, that's the distinction. I, at least potentially, I potentially see here, because I don't think. Now, St. Nicholas is right, a spirit, right? So that's a different case. So Santa Claus may not be the best example because of that connection. But if I go and cosplay as Obi Wan Kenobi, right? Like, I don't think an existent spirit, Obi Wan Kenobi, is going to be acting through me. I think I'm going to be dressed as Obi Wan Kenobi in order to accomplish certain things, to use that Persona in a certain way within a certain certain social setting. So, yeah, that's, That's, I think, a difference."}

I agree with everything you just said. But. But. So within that frame, then, I think there is a difference between people dressing up as Santa Claus and all of the whole matrix of that concept versus, you know, going down to. I can't remember which you know, amusement park in. In Florida where you can meet Star wars characters. Right. And that the way that people participate in Star wars is very different than the way that people participate in the Santa Claus side of things for Christmas, or if you're Dutch, it's just, you know, the presents are on December 6th, as I'm.

Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Because there's a. It's a much deeper cultural experience that's going on with Santa Claus, and there's a lot of investment in the idea that we should at least tell young kids that this. There. There is this spirit, there is this person coming into our house to do this thing. Whereas no one says that to their kids about Luke Skywalker or whatever. Now they might, you know, be at the amusement park and say, oh, look, look, kids, it's Luke Skywalker. You know, that was so great. You got to meet Luke Skywalker. Right. But that'll last for five minutes. That's very different than the participation that happens with Santa Claus. So. And I think the differences of degree in this case, there's a. It's much deeper and richer with Santa Claus. There's a lot more going on there."}

My new book, An Introduction to Extra Biblical Literature, is now available. A lot of Christians today divide ancient Jewish and Christian literature into two categories. What's in the Bible? What's not in the Bible? Christian east, however, has traditionally had a third category, a middle category, books that are read privately in the home. The Greek word for that is Apocrypha. These texts from the centuries before and the centuries after the incarnation of Christ that go beyond even the larger canons of Orthodox and Roman Catholic churches reveal to us the religious world and theological framework of the apostles and early church fathers. In this book, Apocrypha, I survey these works which connect elements of liturgy, scripture, iconography, patristic writings. Familiarity with these works will enhance readers understanding of the breadth and depth of the Orthodox Christian faith.

The Old Testament passage, Fourth Kingdoms, chapter three. So here's my question. In Fourth Kingdoms, chapter three, we read of an alliance of kings. They began their invasion of Moab after Prophet Elijah prophesied, quote, you shall smite every fenced city, end quote. Everything is going according to Elijah's prophecy until the armies reach the last city in which the king of Moab burns his own son alive on the wall as an offering in a desperate attempt to entreat the God of Moab for victory. So in the last verse, it says, a great indignity. Or some translations, it says, wrath came over the armies of Israel and they retreated. It almost seems like the Moabite king burning his son alive on the wall as an offering for victory actually worked. The Moabite stone uncovered in 1868 seems to suggest that this is a celebration of the King of Moab's victory over the people of Israel. St. Jeremy Assyrian said that God may have actually taken pity on the king of Moab. He even goes as far as to say that this sacrifice may have even been received by the God of Abraham. So my question is, was Elisha's prophecy overturned? Was Yahweh really defeated in battle? How are we supposed to understand this passage?"}

So, for example, the book of Jonah, Jonah, when he goes to Nineveh, there's no. If, there's no conditional statement, it's God's going to destroy this city in a few days. That's it. No, if you don't repent, no nothing, right? He just announces, this is going to happen. And then of course they repent and it doesn't happen. And then Jonah says, man, I knew this was going to happen if I came here, right? He says, I knew I was going to come and announce this. And then you were going to follow through because they were going to repent and you'd accept their repentance. In terms of Elijah's prophecy, all of these are contingent. All such prophecies and promises are contingent on obedience, right? And all sort of oracles of doom are dependent on a lack of repentance, right? So otherwise. Otherwise there would be no point in announcing it in advance."}

It's something that happened to them, right? Without God being described as the agent. And then they take the action, the verbal action of retreating. So what's being presented is that they were supposed to put their trust in Yahweh, the God of Israel, who has said, you will have victory. That doesn't mean they didn't have to go fight, right? That didn't mean they didn't have to go fight the battle, right? That meant they were supposed to stay in the battle no matter how bad the battle looked, no matter how bad things got, they were to be faithful. They were to put their trust in God to give them the victory, right? But when they saw the king take this extreme action, which culturally, right, is, I mean, obviously is an extreme action, but this is. This is sort of the ultimate thing because it's the king's son, it's the heir to the throne, right? This is sort of the ultimate thing you could do to get your God, in this case, Chemos, right? On. On their side, the Israelites then were filled with fear and retreated. So they have showed faithlessness, right? They did not trust God to give them the victory.

Yeah, right, right. I mean, that's the ultimate response, because everything is framed. That's part of the purpose of what's going on in 1st and 2nd Samuel 1 and 2 kings, or 1st through 4th kingdoms. Right. Part of the theme there is that all of the good things that happened to Israel are because they were faithful to Yahweh, and all the bad things that happened to Israel are because they were faithless to Yahweh. And that it is not. I mean, the theme is the exact opposite of that. Right. Because the whole purpose of writing these books at the time of the exile of Judah was to say, hey, don't mistake this to think that Marduk beat Yahweh. That's why you're going into exile in Babylon. You're going into exile in Babylon because Yahweh is sending you there. Right. So that reading of that story is pulling it out of context and reading it in the exact opposite way that, that those, that those of the themes of the themes of those books. But this is also a good. See the point that people leave out there say that any pagan who uses this is secretly a Calvinist."}

I mean the dream of the rude is a good example, right? Because in the dream of the rood, the cross is actually talking, right. And I, I don't think it, I mean, I don't know. Correct me if I'm getting this wrong, Father, but I, I don't think it's correct to say that there is a kind of spirit or angel of the cross that we're talking to, but that when we say, you know, help me life giving cross to the Lord, it is a prayer to Christ. Ultimately, you know, there are, I mean, we sometimes do address inanimate objects, you know, and, and like even within the dream of the rude, it's, it, the whole thing is pitched as a dream, right? That this is, that this is a, an image, you know, the dreamer is speaking and saying, I saw the cross and the cross said this and so forth. But the whole thing that the cross talks about in there is all about Christ. It's not about some kind of independent agency.

The analogy I was using was like a spreadsheet or a grid, right? Where you have, okay, here's salvation, here's eschatology and the end of the world. Here's doctrine of God, here's Christology, here's this, here's that. And so when people come to the Orthodox Church, they become inquirers, they become catechumens, they enter the church. Sometimes we approach it as, okay, well, I've got this spreadsheet. I just need to find out what the orthodox answers are and plug those in instead of the old answers. Right. So I used to think that salvation was by faith alone, but now I think it's by, like, faith and works or something, Right? And we just try to. We just try to plug different answers into those same slots. Right? And in order to really understand what's going on with orthodox Christianity, in order to. I mean, we could say the same thing about the Scriptures, right? We have a way that we view the world we live in and the way we read literature that's published today, and we could come to the Bible and try and read it the same way. Right? And we get all kinds of weird results, right? Because the Bible was written in a different time, in different cultures and different places. And so what we really need to do is rather than trying to find the right answers to plug into the grid or the spreadsheet that we've already got, we need to get rid of that spreadsheet and try to approach it fresh. And that's very hard to do. Right. That's something that takes time and work to do. And we have to kind of question our assumptions. Right. Our assumptions and our presuppositions and say, well, wait a minute. Is that really true? Right. Or is that just how I've gotten used to looking at things, you know, so that we can really understand."}

I'm pretty sure that we hold first as a setup. So we proclaim that there is a visible church, the church militant. We say that the church is Israel and has an unbroken continuity with Israel. And I'm pretty sure we say that the entirety of the visible church cannot go apostate. We also have saints in early church writing saying that the church was created before all things. So with those down, my first question is, if Adam and Eve were part of the visible church, what slash, where is the unbroken continuity of the church militant from Adam and Eve to Abraham, especially in light of the first and third fall of man?"}

Here's the problem that I think is with that frame. It's the idea of a sort of. I'm trying to think about the best way to put this. Like. Like you're looking at Genesis and trying to say, okay, where's the succession of laying on of hands that we talk about with apostolic succession in our time? Right. Like, so clearly that's not there. Right. So in what sense is the. I mean, I've even read people say that the church is uncreated. Right. Which means that it's. It's fundamentally the church is a divine experience that humans are having. I don't know that's the best way to put it. And if that's the case, then, you know, then that kind of eliminates this problem that you have between Adam and Abraham. Right. Because God didn't leave. But I think it's, it's. It's to take certain kinds of language about the church and trying to transpose them onto other frames where it doesn't quite work. Right. There is this continuity, but it's not a continuity in the way that apostolic succession is a continuity. Right. That instead that they're both participating in the larger picture of God working in the world with his children, if that makes sense. Does that make sense?"}

So back in the Thanksgiving episode, you mentioned that Luther had this concept of the Eucharist as having a relationship between the hypothetic union of Christ's two natures with the bread and wine. And so that was super problematic, but we won't go into that here. Okay, so why is the hypothetic union of Christ's two natures with bread and wine super problematic?"}

Right. Then that would mean that as a hypostatic union, right. Christ was not united to a man. There was not a human person to whom a human hypostasis to whom the divine hypostasis of the Son was united. That's not how hypostatic union works. Right. The divine person of the Son took upon himself human nature. So for his body to be united to bread in the same way, that would mean he would not be united to a particular piece of bread, a particular hypostasis of bread. He would be united to the nature of bread."}

So the analogy massively breaks down there. Right. So, I mean, points to Luther for the analogy. He was trying to find a way to have the real presence directly in the elements so that Christ's body and blood were received through the mouth. Over against the Calvinist tradition, which went a different way. And I say Calvinist tradition because nobody except Calvin has ever really had Calvin's view of the Eucharist. But. And so he. And he was trying to work with a Christological analogy, Right? And the reason he was trying to work with a Christological analogy is that he was getting called a utician by the Calvinists. He was being accused of because Luther taught that Christ's body was ubiquitous, meaning it's everywhere. Right? Everywhere. That Christ's divine nature is. His human nature must be also. And that includes his human body. Right. Whereas the Calvinist tradition teaches that that is not the case, that Christ's human body is a human body and therefore it is only in one place. That place is at the right hand of God. This is what they teach. So I don't know what that means, frankly. But Luther responded that the right hand of God is everywhere. So, but. And then they refer. Have what they refer to as the extra Calvinisticum, which is the idea that there are places where Christ's divinity is present, but his humanity is not. Calvinism teaches this wow."}

Right? So that's what they accused Luther of, because they said, well, if you're saying his body is everywhere, then it's not a human body anymore anymore, right? You're a utician and he responded by calling them Nestorians. They're saying, you're separating Christ's divinity and his humanity with the extra Calvinisticum. So Luther's trying to hold on to that. Right. He's trying to hold on to something closer to Chalcedonian Christology. Right. His Christology is better. And he's trying to navigate these accusations being thrown at him by the Calvinists. And he still wants to maintain the obvious scriptural truth that the elements of the Eucharist are the body and blood of Christ. He also has a lot of problems with the Roman Catholic version of transubstantiation. So he's trying to avoid that. And he uses this hypostatic union language as a compromise. And as I said, it doesn't work because of the way the hypostatic union works and the difference between nature and hypostasis."}

And one of the people said, One of the people. First of all, I went into this thing about he used to live in Utah and he knew a lot of Mormons and he said, you know, you're dreading. And this, what's really weird about this is this group is really cool. I mean, we may not agree with each other, but everybody respects each other. And this, he's, this guy's fairly new.

I mean, with regards to the Mormons, number one. And I know we have some Mormon listeners, so. Hey, Mormon listeners. Which I think is amazing. I'm so happy that they're listening. But one thing I should say about Mormonism is that it's a bit of a moving target, doctrinally speaking, like, oh, boy, they revise their teachings every so often. And this is just part of their religious way. Like, it's just. It's the way that it is. It can be frustrating even for faithful Mormons. So my understanding of the thing that you're talking about is like there's this notion of this pre existence, right, this premortal existence, and then we get into this mortal existence. In some ways it's almost like origins kind of idea about pre existing souls that kind of get dumped into bodies not exactly the same, but it certainly is kind of originistic in certain weird ways. And there's actually a number of things I think, and I don't know if anyone's done any studies on this. It would be an interesting paper or book maybe to read. I'm not an origin scholar, so I'm not qualified to. But I mean, there's a lot about originism which I think is reflected in Mormon theology. The key thing that I found when trying to parse my way through Mormon theology and the problems that I see with it, I mean, again, our Mormon listeners probably should have. No, no big surprise that we would see problems with Mormon theology is that fundamentally in Mormon theology everything is uncreated. So everything, including God. Right. Is just a rearrangement of pre existing stuff, which is why human beings can become just as God. As God is. Right?"}

I mean, and there was this saying. Now it's largely considered to be like on the outs, but there was this saying by one of the early prophet Presidents Snow. I can't remember his first name off the top of my head now, but you know, as man is God once was, and as God is, man may become. Which is a weird, like there's this weird parallel to the whole Athanasian saying, right, that God became man so that man might become God. In fact, there's a whole school of thought within Mormonism attempting to show that the church fathers are basically teaching Mormon exaltation. But there's some significant differences between that and the doctrine of theoses. The biggest one being that we do not regard God as having been a man in the sense of he used to be just a man and now he got to be God. Good job, God. Right. You know, that's not our teaching at all. But yeah, I think that that's part of what's going on. There's a whole different metaphysical matrix that's being used in Mormon teaching, which is really interesting to try to get a handle on, but it's got some very fundamentally different presuppositions to it than with Christianity."}

It says, when your glorious disciples were enlightened at the washing of the feet before the supper. Was just wondering what the connection, if any, that language has to the prayers that are said when somebody is baptized, the idea of washing and then enlightenment. And then that prayer also goes on to mention Judas subsequently being fixed in his greed, after his partaking of the supper. Sort of paralleling that language to, you know, partaking of the Eucharist onto condemnation."}

A number of your recent episodes have referred to the soul as the life of the body, sort of juxtaposed against a thing. I. I understand that we don't accept everything Plato said about the soul for sure, but as I've read saints like Gregory of Nyssa and John of Damascus, it kind of seems, at least from how I've read it, it kind of seems like the soul is more like an immaterial thing that communicates life to the body instead of being that life itself. In particular, reading some of the Christological debates in the 5th through 7th centuries, you often see this analogy being used pretty much by everybody in different ways, of the soul and the body coming together to form one human being. So I'm just. I'm trying to understand this. This sort of terminological way that the show has been using it because it. I guess I'm a little confused because it seems like the soul is an activity of the body in this system rather than an essence or something like that.

There's problems with how, you know, we even have joked on the show about, you know, your soul being a sphere. Right. Because that's how it's translated in English.

So I've heard both of you talk before about Daniel and kind of just almost, just briefly mentioning how the fourth beast is Rome. And so I'm sure you guys are possibly aware that there's this whole way of reading that where, you know, it's all about the Seleucid empire or kingdom and all about Antiochus, Epiphanies and everything. And I think definitely towards you get when you start to get towards the end of Daniel with some of those other prophecies about the kings of the north and south and the ram and the goat and whatnot. It really does seem like that is kind of directly talking about the time of the Seleucid and Ptolemaic kingdoms. My question is, is the fourth beast slash the bottom, the iron and clay part of the statue earlier in Daniel? Are those sort of directly referring to the Seleucid Empire and Antiochus, for example, as the little horn or something? But then the fathers, such as Jerome and others who interpret it as Rome are kind of elevating that and kind of seeing that type of figure and that type of kingdom. And that type of empire fulfilled in Rome or are they really seeing it as a direct. Are they really seeing it as like, no, Daniel is talking about Rome, like there is a succession of empires and it ends with Rome. And if that's the case, you know, why, why then at the end of Daniel does it seem to flip back? Or am I even understanding that wrong? So I don't know, maybe if you could just talk about that. Because I also know that, for example, with like the abomination of desolation, there's, there's a way of reading that which is the abomination of desolation is Antiochus sacrificing a pig on the altar. But then Christ talks about the abomination of desolation as future tense. And so is that him saying that know that did happen and, but it will be kind of fulfilled again or ultimately in what's going to happen to the, to the temple? Or is he just saying, no, that's one to one talking about what is going to happen. Does that make sense?"}

So you are correct in terms of the Ram and everything that is referring. And the abomination of desolation is referring to Antiochus IV, Epithophenes and the Seleucid dynasty. So one thing we have to remember with the book of Daniel is that it is politely a composite book and impolitely a complete mess in the sense that. Right. And you can get, you could very quickly, even as purely an English reader, get a sense of this by comparing Daniel in the Orthodox Study Bible to Daniel in any other Bible."}

And if you're into this, I at one Point wrote a PhD seminar paper on this and wasted a lot of my life. But the theories out there, because no one knows the theories out there. There's a, there's a Dutch scholar who has spent seemingly his whole career just on this, on why are the Aramaic parts in Aramaic and why are the Hebrew parts in Hebrew? Because there's all these theories. There's theories that it was originally all in Hebrew, but the Hebrew was lost except for the beginning and the end. And so they filled in with the Aramaic version, or it was all in Aramaic originally and something got changed in Hebrew and everything else. And it's deliberate. And this is why. And it's deliberate. But no, that's why there, there's a huge debate about when Daniel was even written. So whether it was all written at the same time. And people who think. There are people who think it was all written in the second century. And so some of them even think it might have been originally in Greek and then parts of it were translated into Hebrew and Aramaic. So it's everywhere. It's all all over the place. And it's very clear when you read it. I mean, again, even just reading it in English, even just reading, not leaving the Greek version out of it, that you have a series of sort of discrete stories, right, that, that aren't. It doesn't directly form a narrative, right? You have, you have these stories regarding Daniel, then you have the story of the three youths who are sort of friends of Daniel, and then you have a series of visions that Daniel has, right, that sort. It goes in this apocalyptic direction. It's kind of a different genre. And it moves through a long span of time from Babylon into the Persian Empire. So all that is to say it can. It can be a mistake to try to say, okay, well, here in this chapter, in this vision of Daniel, it's talking about the Seleucids. Therefore, when he's interpreting Nebuchadnezzar's vision in this chapter, this has. This dream of Nebuchadnezzar's has to be commensurate with this vision that Daniel has in this other chapter. And that's not necessarily the case. Those can be discrete prophetic visions, discrete prophecies talking about different but overlapping things. So I think it's pretty clear that the iron and iron mixed with clay is Rome. And this isn't just a case of Christian interpretation. This is a case of pre Christian Jewish interpretation. Okay, so we have Jewish texts that are interpreting this as Rome and that were interpreting. And Jewish folks will fight you on this. But it's historically demonstrable that the bit about Daniel predicting the number of years between himself and the Messiah coming, the weak. Yeah, yeah. Is not a Christian innovation. It's not us Christians trying to read that back in. There's a reason why in the first century BC in the first century AD there were all these people showing up claiming to be the Messiah. There's a reason why the Jewish revolts happened in the first century A.D. and that's because there were Jewish people reading it that way, reading Daniel that way and saying now's the time and there was this kind of messianic fervor. Now's the time when the stone is going to come and destroy the Roman Empire. Right. And grow into a mountain. Right. They were reading it that way. And so Christians took that reading over non Christian Jews obviously decided, well, that was wrong. They said clearly Bar Kokba wasn't the guy. Right. So we were reading that wrong. It sort of scrapped that mode of interpretation, whereas Christians kept it because."}

And you find that even that language was even used in some of the paschal hymns I noted this year of Christ being that mountain that grew to encompass the earth using the language from that vision.

They're continuing a line of interpretation from pre Christian Judaism that Christianity kept and kind of got scrapped as incorrect by other Jewish communities. Last bit, I think in terms of what you asked is the abomination of desolation. That is what Antiochus the Fourth Epiphanes did. That is also something that is going a pattern that is going to be fulfilled in the future according to Jesus by the Antichrist, who we are going to talk about in one month, two episodes from now on.

Now, I have no doubt that that way of life requires a high deal of asceticism, but doesn't seem to have kind of leaving the world aspect that the episodes seem to think to allude. That was pretty indicative of the purpose of the monastic tonsure. So priests who are still involved in parish communities and diocesan leadership. I was just kind of curious what the purpose was there of involving the monastic tonsure."}

So this is definitely a thing. You get these higher monks or egumans and so forth, who are just serving in parishes and not living in monasteries and probably just have their own apartment, their own house. Some of them used to be in monasteries. So there is that living connection with monasticism. But a lot of them know, a lot of them. And so here's the ideal. The ideal is that they get that tonsure so that they then have a form of life which has a higher intensity of spiritual discipline, so that they can to. To. To make up for the fact that they frankly don't have a. A wife at home saying, what is the matter with you? Which is a really important thing that. That wives do for husbands, because the secret about men as they age is that they get weirder. And if there's not a wife there."}

But, you know, it's a mitigating experience to be married as you get weirder and older. But monasticism can also help to prevent the weirdness in a different way. Although monks can definitely be weird. I've known some weird monks, but. But the point being that they don't have the asceticism of family. And so they're taking on this other, this other form of asceticism that I would say is the ideal so that they live as monks. And usually if they're living in that way they are connected to a monastery, they gotta. Had to get tonsured somewhere and would have this living connection with the monastery, maybe visiting every so often, certainly being instructed, instructed by maybe the abbot or some other spiritual father. I also know at the same time there are some, God bless them, who go through the tonsure as pure formality and do not live as monks. That makes zero sense to me. I don't know why anyone would do that, but that is a thing. But I also know some that do essentially live as monks. Maybe they don't take on every single form of the, the outward discipline. Like for instance, they may cut their hair and, or their beards. Normally inside a monastery, a monk does not cut his hair or beard unless it gets really in the way, which, you know, that's a thing. But, you know, sometimes when a monk lives outside the monastery for a while, even if they're from a monastery, they may choose to cut their hair and beard just because, you know, living in the world, maybe they have a, like a secular job or something like that. It can require that. But yeah, so there's kind of a range I've noticed in those who do that. I mean, obviously I'm married, I have four children, so I don't know what it's like to live like that. But I have noticed I've known some celibate priest monks who are not in monasteries who basically live like monks. And then I've noticed some that it's just a title and doesn't really seem to actually be part of their life. And I mean, that's between them and their bishop, ultimately, and God. But that's what I have to say about that. Anything you want to add, Father Stephen?"}

Right. Like St. Augustine famously did that because they were generally monastics. And when you start getting to the modern period, you start getting more and more exceptions to this. If you read the writings of modern orthodox saints, many of them decry this and say this is a bad idea, that this makes it really hard on monastics having to be a monastic living in the world. Right. And there's also a variation in practice, like in the US in different jurisdictions. So there are some orthodox jurisdictions in the US where most ordained single men are expected to be celibate but have not received monastic tonsure. And then in one of those jurisdictions, I'm thinking of if they get made a bishop, they get tonsured on the way to being made a bishop. Yeah. In another one, I'm thinking of some of the bishops have never received monastic tonsure. So there's, there's now a difference in modern practice in that regard. And as I said, not me, modern saints have said this is very dangerous and very difficult for the monastic person to not be in that monastic environment. And I think frankly, recently it's gotten even more difficult and more dangerous because we've got folks who are monastics who seem to be spending a lot of time on the Internet. And I'm not in charge of them. I, I'm not going to tell them to get off the Internet any more than I tell everybody to get off the Internet. But I mean, not in particular, not by name. You know, I'm not in charge of them to where I could order them to get off the Internet. But it seems to me to be very dangerous for someone who's trying to live a monastic way of life to spend a lot of time on the Internet because of how bad it is for everyone to spend a lot of time on the Internet. So I think we've got to be honest in the sense of being self critical. And I have criticized, again, who cares? I'll just be honest. I've criticized the Roman Catholic Church in particular for being kind of one thing on paper and one thing in actual practice. So I think we, if I'm going to criticize that, then I think we as orthodox people have to be honest and say, yeah, there's one way things are supposed to work on paper. And in our modern contemporary practice, a lot of times it doesn't work that way. And it's not always good that it doesn't work that way."}

So your episode was the first time I'd heard it referred explicitly as a sacrament. And I was curious about what's different about holy water as opposed to holy unction or the Eucharist, for example, where they're restricted to just those who are in communion with the church. But holy water seems to be a lot more accessible to those outside the church. I've heard of non Orthodox Christians getting their homes blessed with holy water, and then at theophany, the water is there for kind of everyone. So what makes it more as a sacrament, more safe for those outside the church to also participate in?"}

So holy water is used for blessing creation. Right. So, I mean, you know, whatever, we use it to bless everything. So I, I, yeah, it's, it's, it's just like, it's like, it's like saying, well, you know, if, if holy unction is for the forgiveness of sins and for the healing of, you know, of body as well, couldn't we just trade it out and say, well, we're just going to give unction today instead of the Eucharist? Because theoretically the Eucharist is also for the healing of the soul and body. Right. Shouldn't they be interchangeable? But they're not because the way in which they're used is different. And the whole rite around each one is set up differently as a result of that, you know, you read the actual prayers that are indicated. Like if you listen to the prayers for the great blessing of the water, which we talked a little bit about, they go on and on, which is why we didn't read the whole thing. It really is about this cosmic scope of God working in the whole creation. Right. So I mean, that's what I would have to say about that. I don't know. Father Stephen, you got something else or more or different?"}

So when I'm giving the Sacrament of holy Unction, most of the time I'm not consecrating the oil. I have oil that I save from Holy Wednesday, and I go and visit someone in the hospital and anoint them with that oil. Right? So for that person in the hospital, the sacrament is the being anointed, right? Same thing with the Eucharist, Right? The. The sacrament of the Eucharist is not just the consecration of the gifts, it's also the giving of the Eucharist, Right? The administration to. To the person. Whereas with the blessing of holy water, the sacrament is the blessing of the water. It is the sanctification of the water, not its administration. Okay, so that water that's been blessed is then used for these other things. Right? And that's a difference. And we use that water to go and bless other things. Right? So my. My parishioner has a business, right. They have a restaurant. I go and I bless the restaurant and I throw holy water everywhere. Right? It's not like, okay, now only Orthodox Christians are allowed to come in here and use the equipment and. And eat the food, right? It's blessed for everyone. And this makes the great blessing of the waters an important and holy water an important sacramental reality, because this is a place where we see the fact that the church has this role in relation to the entire world."}

Something that kind of came out from reading the Orthodox Study Bible. Specifically, when it talks about the tree of life being planted in Genesis 2, it basically says the. The tree of life in the middle of paradise or in the middle of the garden. And then later, when Adam and Eve have. Are trying to hide. When they're trying to hide from God, it says they hid in the middle of the tree of the garden, I think is how it's rendered in. In the Orthodox Study Bible. I'm familiar that word there. The. To Salon could be, you know, like, collective, like the woods. And I know other translations use that, but it jumped out at me because it's singular and it's. Other English translations of the Septuagint have the singular tree there, too. And it kind of got me thinking, like, is this. You know, you will surely die to avoid the implications of that? Adam and Eve then hide in the midst of the tree of life? Or is that reading way too much into the text? And if so, if it's not, who else has thought that in church history? And where can I learn more?"}

I mean, since. Since I. I guess. And, you know, I don't read Hebrew, but Father Stephen does. It is plural in the Hebrew. Yeah. I mean, the word that's there in the Greek is. Is xilu. Right. Which is. Is just wood, you know. So, for instance, Christ is said to be. And you know, in the. The 15th antiphon of matins of Holy Friday, the very famous hymn, he is hung upon the tree. He who suspended the earth of the waters is suspended on the tree. But what it says literally in the Greek is he's suspended on Epixilu. I think that's the. I'm not sure if that's the correct declension, but. But it's the same word. Right. Upon the wood. So, yeah, I don't know. I wouldn't read too much into it as a singular, suggesting that this is the tree of life or something like that."}

He said, make the place you're in into paradise. And the great thing about that advice is it's so multivalent. You can apply it in so many different ways. Right. I mean, but one of the most immediately applicable, I think, is a really. A dedication to beauty. Our American culture has us always casting our minds and our gaze outside of where we are. Like, we're always looking at imagery of other people who live thousands of miles away from us. You know, like, you know, and. And so I often, you get, like, you can kind of notice this. Like, I. I live in a neighborhood with lots of houses, and you can walk around. You can tell the ones where the people kind of live inside the house and just, like, mow the lawn. And then people that are working on the space around their house to try to turn it into a little paradise in one way or another, you know, to their. To their degree of their ability. And I think that. That, like, putting everything in order and dedicating it to beauty, even small beauty. Right. Like that. We don't have to be the best at every single thing that we do. We can still dedicate ourselves to doing it as best as we can. Like, people like, well, I'll never be able to sing. Sing like Taylor Swift, who is actually from. Not very far away from where I live. You know, she's from the town of Reading, which. Reading is a perfectly nice city, but it's, like, not a glamorous place to be from. But she's from Reading, Pennsylvania. But nonetheless, you can still sing with your family, and music can be part of that paradisaical way of living in your home. You know, like, there's all these ways of doing it. It's. It's about shaping the space. I always love noticing the way that monasteries are shaped. And one thing I've noticed is that women's monasteries tend to Be much more aesthetically interesting in a lot of ways than men's monasteries. I mean, there are some excellent male monastic gardeners, don't get me wrong. I mean, I went to Athos. I saw some amazing stuff. Stuff there. But frankly, women's monasteries are just much sort of nicer to walk around in. And it's funny because, I mean, these are people that all have the same vocation, but it manifests in different ways according to the personality that are people that are there. They're turning their place into paradise. It's why you want to just stroll around and pray, because they made it that way, you know, so those are the things that I would say about that. But also, you know, that. That a significant piece of it being about trying to heal the hurts of the people in your home and those around you, because that's what paradise is supposed to be as well. It's supposed to be healing."}

But my question is actually not really along those lines. It's just something that I've been very curious about. My fiance comes from a Catholic background, and I am from a Protestant background. And just in all of our discussions and maybe quarrels here and there, one of the things that was kind of brought up in evidence of the truth of the Catholic Church in all these discussions was some examples of eucharistic miracles. And I just. I mean, there's a lot of accounts of them happening all over the world, and there's video footage, and sometimes they even get specimens tested in labs and they find that it's real human flesh or blood or, you know, it all lines up. And I just, like, don't know how to compute that. I don't know what to make of it. And I don't know if there's an answer to this question. But I was just curious if anyone in the orthodox realm has a stance on that or has any insight to share on how to kind of process what's going on there."}

I know that people often treat miracles this way. Like, look, we've got a miracle. That means everything else we do is right. Or we're the real deal.

Setting that question aside, like, is that what miracles are for? But the reality is that there are miracles observed in a lot of places. You know, I like you, I have a Protestant background. I grew up the son of missionaries, and I talked with a lot of other missionary kids, and a number of them told me tales from the mission field, which, assuming they weren't all lying to me, were definitely miraculous stuff."}

Another is that it's from God and it's designed to call people to repentance. The real test is whether people are repenting, you know?"}

Right. Like, so. Which, I mean, seems like an obvious thing to say, but I like to give an example that I think is a little bit shocking. Father Stephen mentioned Jonah earlier and, you know, the repentance of the people of Nineveh. So they really repented. You know, it's mentioned in the New Testament that they did. Right. That they're going to rise up as witnesses against, against unrepentant people. Well, here's the funny thing. There's no indication that Nineveh ever turned to worshiping Yahweh. So these are pagans, but they did repent. They did successfully repent so that God did not smash their city. So, you know, repentance is a miraculous thing. I mean, so, so, yeah, I, I, I think as an apologetic, it's just, it's just a, I mean, I understand why people like to, to use it because, like, wow, that's really great. You know, that's amazing. But, but when you start to ask questions of that as an apologetic, it really starts to fall apart. I would just simply say that it's evidence that God is working in a lot of different contexts, you know, and, you know, if someone's repenting, that is repenting. If, if something is an icon of the Mother of God, I don't care which chapel it's hanging in, it is an icon of the Mother of God. You know, like, it's, it is what it is. So, you know, apologetics need to be done on other grounds. I don't think that that's a good ground. I don't know. Father, do you have anything you want to add to that?"}

He was not a Christian. They planted him as a priest. He was celebrating the liturgy and looked at the patent and saw bloody human flesh. This was a sign of God's judgment on him. He ended up actually becoming a Christian and ended up being a martyr when he turned on his handlers during the Communist period. So for us, some of these signs are signs of the exact opposite thing that they're sometimes presented as in the West. I know this is going to get a bunch of Catholic listeners mad at me, but I'm sorry, this is the truth. From an Orthodox perspective, when those things have happened in the east, we viewed them as signs of God's wrath and judgment not as positive miracles. And we do not believe in presenting miracles as proof of the truth of something or the authority of someone. And that goes right back to the Scriptures. No one ever does that in the Scriptures, least of all Christ."}

I think that that's going to help me a lot in just kind of wrapping my mind around the concept. And I mean, I already thought about. I guess I thought about other miracles in that way, that kind of open way, like God can work wherever he wants to work. It doesn't have to be within the confines of one church, but for some reason, this specific kind, just because I guess, of how it had been used or, you know, there will be articles written or videos shared on the Internet. I don't know why. It just kind of perked my interest, and I couldn't really figure out what was going on there. So I think this does help a lot in just kind of wrapping my mind around all of it as a concept and basing it back in Scripture for sure. So thank you very much."}
