All right, so hello, everybody. I am very happy to be here with Greg Hurwitz. Greg has been on my channel before. You might have seen him. He's also been involved with Daily Wire, the Exodus series that we're doing. We've had great conversations. You might have also seen the conversation between Greg, myself and Jordan about Jordan's tweets. So I would say that in the process of this, we are. We're kind of progressively becoming friends and discovering our relationship, like discovering the similarities and differences between our position. Greg comes from a more democratic kind of, let's say, left leaning world, but he's been really great at crossing bridges and being able to discuss things in ways that sometimes it's hard to do. So today I want to talk especially about a new book that he. A new comic book that he put out called New Think, in which he. It's like a modern fairy tale that deals with AI and, and some of the problems of technology. So I'm sure we'll veer to all kinds of things, but. But that's what. At least the beginning of the conversation. So, Greg, thanks for. Thanks for coming."}

A copy of New Think a while ago and I went through it and I was really excited to see. First of all, it's beautiful, by the way. Like, the art is just really beautiful. There's something very poetic about the way that you do the work. And the paneling, it's almost nonlinear in terms of the way the panel is set up in the Text, you can read it. You actually create interesting ambiguity in the way that you set up the text in the pages so that even if you could read it in different ways, but it would still kind of bring you the thrust of the narrative. I thought that was very fascinating. But mostly what I, what I was fascinated by was this capacity to take fairy tale tropes. You know, the vampire, the. This kind of possessing agent. Right. This demon or something like that, but then frame it as. Frame it in the technological world. So first question is. Yeah. What is the thought process that drove you into that. That mode?"}
{"episode_id":"SW - #278 - 2023-03-16 - Gregg Hurwitz - New Think","start":188.68,"end":333.47,"speaker":"Greg Hurwitz","text":"Well, I was thinking about, I mean, there's so much that's happening in our world that is so utterly insane. And it's like we're like a frog being boiled one degree at a time. Right. And so I keep thinking if we ported us in from 20 years ago and sat us down in this moment of what's happening technologically, it's just, it's bananas. We can't even make sense of it. I mean, I sent Jordan an email the other day because we were talking about his Rogan interview. And I just pinged him. I said, you know, hey, I just watched that on 3.5 acts. And he was like, to. And I just said, imagine back when we were, when you were my advisor, if we were strolling across, you know, college campus and. And I said to you, hey, you know, 20 years in the future or 30 years in the future, however long it's been. You know, you're going to be announcing like a new project for sovereign nations in Europe and you're going to go on the website of a media news demon who's a former mixed martial arts fighter and professional comedian who is the biggest news interviewer on the planet. And you're going to have an exchange with him and I'm going to ping you and say that I watched the exchange at 3.5 speed. And you'll respond, yeah, me too. And there's going to be nothing else we say about it. I mean, it's utterly surreal what we're living in right now in so many ways. And so I thought, you know, I've. I've written a lot of thrillers, fiction, horror. I've played around with a lot of different forms and I thought it'd be really fun to tell these kind of like black mirror like tales to have five of them. Right. The first one is a science fiction thriller. The second one's a fairy tale. The third one is a kind of vampire horror stalker story. The fourth one is a time traveler story. And the fifth one's a children's tale, like a children's story. And I wanted to take these tropes and kind of twist them around so that I'm showing our reality through just a different lens, a different kind of frame break. And that's something we do a lot in. You know, when we talk about things politically and culturally. Right. Is we. If you want to make people think differently, you have to break the frame on how we're viewing our own situation and our own situation. Now. Our reality is so surreal and so bizarre that I don't even need to tell stories that are actual science fiction. I could just tell our current reality through a different lens to show the insanity. So I did five stories like that with five wonderful artists."}

I think it's interesting especially because, like you said, you're not. You almost don't have to show a dystopian future. You're basically representing something which is happening now, and you. But you're just framing it through narrative in order for people to be able to see it differently. And that in some ways, it's almost. It's different from Black Mirror even, because Black Mirror, they've been very prescient. Like, they. They kind of just look that one step ahead, and they've been pretty good at it. But you're just showing us the reality now."}

I mean, the first story is called the Screens, and I spell it with a K so that it sounds science fiction, but it's screens. It's computer screens. And basically I show how they came as sort of a sentient being. If you describe them, that they came to Earth, right? And first they were, like, giant and corpulent and, you know, and there was just a few, and they were. They were very expensive. And then through time, we basically worshiped them. And then we became enslaved by them, Right? Like, they got smaller and sleeker and thinner, and we got kind of more obese and more dysregulated, Right? And we worshiped them at our altars at home with our laptops, like the one I'm talking to you on now. And then we have. We have these things we carry with us all the time. And, right. We go to bed with them. We wake up with them. They're monitoring our whole life. And we. We carry them on our transportation to work. And then we sit down at another altar and then deal with that screen at that altar. And we Basically are, you know, we're constantly managing them and maintaining them and updating them and finding patches for them and making sure that they work. And so I just frame this as a story. Like, if you view our relationship with our screens, with our computers through a different lens, they basically come to Earth and enslaved us."}
{"episode_id":"SW - #278 - 2023-03-16 - Gregg Hurwitz - New Think","start":441.89,"end":554.92,"speaker":"Jonathan Pageau","text":"Yeah. I mean, what's interesting about. To me in that particular story, you know, for the last few years, I've been trying to. To talk with cognitive scientists and different people about the manner in which agency manifests itself and so also help people understand in some ways what even the ancients thought when they use the word demon or the word angel. This idea of transpersonal agency that is coherent and acts upon us. And even in terms of mythological thinking in the Christian world, there's this whole idea, you probably know, these legends, these, these legends about how, you know, these fallen angels came to Earth and taught people technology, and then that brought about kind of corruption and, and that's what's led to the flood, for example. But I feel like today, at least today, because we're seeing what's going on and we. We feel like we're not in control of. And it's interesting because I saw it with my own kids, you know, when I. We were homeschooling for a very long time. And when I finally put my kids in school the first year, my daughter, I told her, you don't need a phone. You know, why. Why would you have a phone? Like, this is ridiculous. You're, you know, you're 13. You don't need a phone. And she was like, dad, I need a phone. If I don't have a phone, I won't be able to do anything. And we're like, no. So. So she didn't have a phone for the first year she was in high school. And then we realized that we had basically alienated her from every other child and that she had no friends, nobody. Nobody talked to her, she wouldn't. Nobody wanted to see her because she just was out of the system. And then we had to give her a phone if she was going to go to school. And then you realize that you're not in control. Like, exactly what you show that there's a type of agency that is leading us and we just kind of play along, and if we don't, we get so excluded that we. We can't participate."}
{"episode_id":"SW - #278 - 2023-03-16 - Gregg Hurwitz - New Think","start":555.24,"end":776.87,"speaker":"Greg Hurwitz","text":"That's exactly right. I mean, I've been through this, you know, with, with both my daughters in different ways, but my youngest daughter doesn't have anything. I Mean, she has a phone to text, but she herself got off Instagram eventually. But I mean, the way I think about this is it's like we all know what's ha. So, look, I'm powerless in the face of it. If I go on Twitter every day, if I'm on, let's say I'm out on a book tour and I'm. So I'm checking, like, reviews and where I'm supposed to be and stuff, I actually can see that my attention span is getting fragmented, right? So my own agency, my own intelligence, such as it is, my own training, it's not better than teams of addiction specialists hired by a social media company backed by deep machine learning algorithms. I can't overcome that. That's. That's insane to think that I can. And they look, you know, when you're scrolling on your phone or when you're on a screen, they can see. They track, like, your eyes. Like, if you hitch on one tweet a little bit or on one post, let's say they know where you're hitching to give you more of that. And so I just keep thinking, like, imagine if I was in seventh or eighth grade, right? I don't even have myelination of my prefrontal cortex yet, and I'm being bombarded with the most salacious possible gossip that's designed algorithmically to target my anxiety, outraged lust, right? To keep me glued to that screen. You know, it's like your phone is basically a terrorist that's trying to extort you for money. And so anytime you're on your phone and you feel something, someone's making money. So of course, here it is that it's a tool that we need to use because, well, some of us do, right? Some of us don't. We could always go off and live in a yurt and have a different existence. That makes a lot of other kind of sense. But if we're trying to integrate in the world, we need it. But I mean, imagine like, these phones are so dangerous in certain ways if they're not controlled. It's like with our kids, we almost are seeding to be like, okay, well, you can have a little bit of crack so that you're not left out of. Everybody else is doing crack all the time. Like, we don't want you to be excluded from the crack community. So why don't you go on and have a ton of images of other kids, right, who are posting an idealized version of themselves that you can look at this fake version and then know that you're not living up to it because it's fantasy, but you alone know that you're not. Yeah. And my sister's a pediatric gastroenterologist, and she made an amazing point about this. She's in the Bay Area, and she sees kids all the time who are like, I can't sleep. I have anxiety, I have depression, I'm not eating. And she goes, give me your phone. And they give the phone, and she goes, oh, look, you're on your phone 11 hours a day. Right. How often are you on your phone? They're like, I don't know, like two, three hours. And you can look on an iPhone and they're being eaten by it. And she also made a point that I thought was quite brilliant where she said, you know, it used to be, let's say you go home for the summer and let's say two of your friends or acquaintances went on a trip that summer together, like to a lake or to Hawaii. If you go back to school on, you know, in September when school's back in, and they say, oh, my God, we had so much fun, you know, at the beach, you feel really bad, and then you go to homeroom, and then you go to recess and you move on. But now you're home, and every single day, they're posting. Like, you're looking at these other kids where you're not posting. And what they're not posting is the fight they got in, or the fact that there was a jellyfish thing, or the fact that someone was super passive aggressive and they had a big fight, or that someone's boyfriend was mean, or the food sucked. They're posing, they're posting these posed versions of themselves. And it's constantly in your face. This, like, sort of fake reality. I mean, that's even before we get into the filters."}

And what's interesting is, like I said, the notion that it's experienced as agency on us to a certain extent, and it has its own logic and its own kind of moving its feet in the world. That a good example is, even now, my kids, you know, the same with my youngest daughter, we try to hold back the phone as long as possible, but then the teachers give people their Homework in class on their phones. So if you don't have a phone in class, you can't even function because the teacher is literally giving the assignments and will give quizzes on people's phones. It's like, man."}
{"episode_id":"SW - #278 - 2023-03-16 - Gregg Hurwitz - New Think","start":830.12,"end":1007.61,"speaker":"Greg Hurwitz","text":"My wife was a psychologist. Is a psychologist. So she was in the field for a lot of years, which is great because she was very practical. She worked with like, child prostitutes and kids one step before juvie, and then she went and taught. So she had a lot of clinical experience to bring to bear. And one of the things she would do is have the. Have her students get off their phones for just a long weekend, four or five days, and keep a journal. And they exploded. They were sweating. Some of the kids in her class didn't know how to turn their phones off. She had one person whose wife was emailing her because she thought that the he was having an affair by not responding, like, Right, right. Her mind. And the other thing that happened is she had students who were dating and what they realized was, is whenever they had an argument, they couldn't have an argument face to face. So they'd have to leave and then resolve their stuff over texting, right? And so what was very interesting for me about that is when we talk, and particularly if you sing, for instance, we have immunoglobulin B, right? Which is a great autoimmune booster. Like when we. When. If you sing, especially if you sing with other people, especially if it's in a choir. So here we are, back to the sacred, let's say. Yeah, it boosts it, right? Yeah, it boosts your. Your sort of immune system as you're singing, as you're using your mouth as your. Because our tongue's wired to. Our brain is wired to community. And so as increasingly you see, kids kind of flatter of affect, right? Like, we all have that story where we sound like cranky old people. We're like, these kids are so disaffected, right? Like, they don't know how to express or make eye contact. But if your whole expression is that your face is blank and you're here and you're using a special language that's designed, right, to make it easier for the phones, not for us, or to make us more malleable for the phones. Giant, laughy cry face. Lol. And I've seen people do that where they're deadpan, lol. Rolling on the floor laughing, right? And they're deadpan. We're actually moving off our evolutionary design. You're not moving our mouths. We're not. We're not engaging. Right. If you're in a conversation with somebody, you know, oxytocin is the bonding hormone. Right. That there's a release and that that's not just for intimate engagement where it occurs. Right. And not in individual engagement, let's just say, but it's also in conversation among friends. And so if you're talking and you have a close relationship where you're focused, I forget the amount of time, but there's an amount of time if you're sitting in, you know, a discussion or fellowship, whatever you want to call it, with close friends, there's a release that you get of a bonding hormone. Right. But if you have a phone out and you check it every so often, you don't get that release. And part of that has to do with us checking a close visual field. Far visual field. Close visual field. Far, far visual field. It's triggering different parts of the brain. And so we can't settle into something that actually derives feelings of. Of kind of bonding and community."}

Yeah, your mind is also just split when you're doing that. If you're with friends, but you've got your phone and. And every time you've got a chance, you just kind of check to see what's what, your notifications or whatever, and you are not there. Like, you are. Your. Your attention is split."}

It's like, we're not God. We're not supposed to have access to every single thing, every person in our entire community that's even unim. Like, oh, that guy who I had, you know, I was in little League with and the girl I had a crush with in fifth grade, like, oh, how is she feeling about her cat? Or President Trump right now? It's this inundation, right. Of information. And there's a sort of arrogance to think that we can moderate and dip in to the entirety of the world. Yeah, of course. It's like, you know, again, what are we going to do? Because we can have a discussion. You know, when the print, when the fabric looms were introduced, for instance, Austria's entire peasant class, I think this is in the 1800s, was reliant on making money with their hand stitching. So they just shut it off. They had an authoritarian state and said, no, we're not going to accept them. Right. But England had and integrated them and then continued to go take over the world. And, you know, Austria kind of shriveled up. So we also can't stand in the way of it and have, like, our own little, like, Luddite circle where we're. We're removed from the world in a way that we need to engage. And so it's a lot of what I've been thinking about since our Exodus seminar, Jonathan, because in particular, I think for me, you have a way of talking about faith and organized religion that really resonates with me because you pay so much attention to aspects of the fringe and how the fringe negotiates with the middle and what the middle is. Right? And a real openness about the fact that in any faith or. Well, certainly we were focusing in this instance in Judeo, we'll call it Judeo Christian, because we all know where things are headed. Faith, that there's an admonishment against too much pureness. Like, one of the things that was so funny is we were talking about the story of Miriam, right? Who came in all snotty pants about Moses when he wanted to marry an Ethiopian and she was, you know, clucking at him that he shouldn't, right? It's too much outsider, right? Skin color doesn't match. And in one of the great strokes of humor in the Old Testament, God came down and turned her Snow White. It's like, oh, you want to be pure? You want to be too pure? How about if I make you glow and now get out of the camp for seven days? So she's this, like, glowing, unappealing, ridiculous version of too much pureness."}

Which you illuminated for me in a way I didn't understand. Coming from my world, I think, well, who knows what world I come from? But meaning a lot of people who are. Who are. Let's call it tilting, more liberal, have a view that. That religion only wants to impose sameness and only wants to have exclusion, right? But here's this clear admonishment to say too much pureness, right? That's the monster of the right. Like, how dare you? How dare you not allow integration in new ideas? And I was captivated also by the fact that, you know, after Moses strikes the stone twice, oops, and then gets excluded and his entire generation is excluded from entering the Promised Land also due to some of the lying about what they saw in Canaan, the only two people of that generation allowed to enter the Promised Land are Joshua and Caleb. And Caleb's not an Israelite. So it's like 50% of the elders who enter the Promised Land are foreigners, right? Like, why is that. Right. That's not a lesson of ultimate purity."}

You can see it as a mediation between, let's say, unity and multiplicity. And that's one of the tracks that you can follow to see the story of Exodus. And if you do it that way, it's very powerful because, you know, in some ways there's a. There's an. You know, it talks about the mixed multitudes. There's a few times where it mentioned uses that term. And there's a sense in which that's not good. Like you don't want just a bunch of different people that coexist together without any sense of unity. But then, then there's a covenant that binds them together and that actually makes them participate. But in that participation, there's different differentiation and there's, you know, all the tribes continue to exist and, and the strangers also exist in the. In the land. Like Caleb says that Caleb gets the fringe of the camp, gets the outside of the camp. So he participates. He's not totally on the inside. He is, but he. He has that. He has the border, let's say. And that you could imagine that that's like a normal thing. And in any. Any state, like if you had two empires, the people on the border would necessarily be mixed with the other empire. Like, so they would get the border because they're not. They're kind of mixed. And that's fine. That's how it kind of works. You need those buffers between identities in order to function. So I think that that's one of the places where I hope that the conversation, let's say, about how traditional societies really function can avoid the problem of the opposite. Right. Like you said of thinking that tradition is just like a kind of purity and that breaking tradition or modernity is just about kind of shattering that. But it's. Traditional societies are quite a way more organic than that in the actual way they function well."}

That's rare. Like, I think a lot of people, you know, they're. They don't under. It's not like faith, it's not like religion has been uncorrupted any more than the rest of our institutions. Right. Or captured politically. And so I think people have a sort of pullback from any mention of it in a way the same way that other people will. If you talk about like a straight secular higher education. Right. Or your. You know, HR department, right. Or like all these places that have gotten kind of overlaid in, in their own aspect, some of which, of course, there's, there's uncropped versions of everything, faith included. But what was so interesting for me about that was it fit so much in a lot of the thinking I've been doing about our culture, which is we have to have conservatives, we also have to have liberals, and guess what, that bell curve of those traits. And not to detour too much, but there's. We have big five personality traits that are integral to us, that determine very much which way we sort of will lean on a spectrum that can then be measured politically. And they're the same across all races and cultures. It's not like black people and brown people are liberal. They're not. I mean, one of the big jokes in the 2020 election was that Biden got the Latin X vote and Trump got the Latino vote. Right. It's like, it's not like we divide into these personality traits by the color of our skin."}

Whether one views that as evolutionarily selected or God given or is that the same thing? And part of that is so that, you know, conservatives who want to tilt more towards holding order, which is necessary, Right. Some in group favoritism. Right. We need wall. Right? And you think about that for when, let's say the Native Americans, when Europeans were coming towards them with smallpox infused blankets, like it made sense to have a bit of distrust, right. For an outsider. But liberals say, wait a minute, if you build a wall and it's not porous and there's no movement, then we stagnate and die. New ideas and people can't get in and we can't revivify ourselves culturally and artistically. We don't let in the grateful immigrant. Right. We don't let in the things that feed the culture itself. And so getting that balance. Right. And this is, this is me getting back around to what we're talking about with technology. I mean, one of the things that was really, in some ways the most compelling to me about Exodus was the realization in some ways that that one of the key aspects, one of the key roles that faith can play when it is not corrupt or captured, right. When it's embodied in people who are really talking about it through a lens of love and order. Right. Not just overwhelming empathy, not just overwhelming judgment. Right. But really the integrated full embrace without hypocrisy is that it's one of the key aspects of how we order our communities, you know, and so the notion I had is almost like, you know, faith in the, in the, in this example or in this frame that we're discussing. It's like it's the conductor, right, that sets the sections of a community in place. And without it, all the sections are blaring discordantly. But it also doesn't mean you don't want the conductor to go sit down in the sections and play the flute and play the trombone and do all that. That's not the conductor's job either. You can't have faith shot through all of society because then everything becomes too uniform. And so part of me is thinking a lot about the role that we need from all of our communities to find the aspects that are neither corrupt nor captured ideologically. Right. And how to bring that community into harmonious relation, which of course our faith in, our faith communities have to play a big role in that. And if we have that all of a sudden, we could set different parameters around technology to go, hey, you know what, maybe our kids in school, maybe everyone checks their phone at the front, at the front, right? They all put their phone in a box at the start of the day and they get it back at the end of the day. Well, our communities aren't harmonize sufficiently for us to like, we feel powerless to make that discussion because there's so many fights and arguments. Right. And I think a lot about, you know, with Tick Tock, I'm going to get some of the specific facts wrong. But some of your viewers, I'm sure, can correct or update this. But you know, TikTok, it's kind of like a massive psyops operation, right? I mean, it's in from China. They put all those filters, look, I'm a bunny, look, I'm a unicorn. Right. It's capturing facial recognition. And in the U.S. you know, one of the things that they've done in their export is to lowers, quick, lower the amount of time that each video will take place. So it's something like it used to be 14 seconds, then they lowered it to 12, now they lowered it to 8. They're just scissoring our kids. Focus and delay of gratification and attention span and ability to focus. It's literally doing that. That's rewiring the prefrontal cortex of our kids. But in China, they're only allowed 20 minutes a day and it has to be educational. Yeah. So like at home they're eating broccoli and then they're exporting heroin, right? And we're letting it happen. And we all know that it's there. You can read an article about it. But we can't get our communities and our politics and our businesses together to look at this and just go, hang on a minute, right? It's like we've lost our ability to reach a sane consensus about certain things, and that's what we got to get together. And that's a lot of what we were trying to discuss in Exodus."}

That's fascinating because in some ways, it kind of raised the alarm in the sense that one of the things that I tried to help people understand is that religion ultimately, at the first stance, has to do with attention, right? That's what it has to do with. So it's worship. That's what it is. And so I think that many people, they don't totally understand, like, why worship? What is this thing? You get together and then you sing songs. You know, you sing songs to God and you all pray to God. It's like. It seems flaky and ridiculous, but the idea is to understand that it's attention that binds us, right? Common attention is what binds us together. And so if we. If we're together and we're focused on the same thing, like in a sports team, for example, then that will bind us. Like, we'll experience togetherness in a way that is hard to describe. If you know that we're all trying to score a goal in a soccer game, then all of a sudden, it's like things start to move together. You start to be aware of the other person without thinking. You make a pass without looking. The person is there for some reason. It's like this magical cohesion that happens as you're moving towards a purpose. But that has to do with common attention. So religion and faith, what it tries to do is to identify what's the highest point. What's the highest point of attention. What's the thing that can bind us most to the most together in the. In the. The most important way and the highest way. And so you could say. I mean, a simple way to say it. It's like if we all stand together and worship the creator of the universe, who is also the God of love, you know, who loves us and made us in his image, it's like, maybe that would be the highest point of attention that would bind us towards. And then things will flow down from there. And so one of the things that's interesting about the whole technology question, the capture of the screens that you talk about and you think is that it's doing the opposite, literally in the algorithms. What it does is that it identifies your idiosyncrasy and then it feeds you more of that idiosyncrasy because it's the most immediate way. Common attention is hard. It's difficult to work together towards a purpose. But like that little kick of like get what you, what you want in your, in your little private desires, that's easy to give you. The more I give you that then we're actually kind of fragmenting ourselves."}

And you know, so we were there with, with, with a good friend who is a giant AI brain who, who I was joking is like baby Hitler. Like we just have to take him out now right before he ends the world. But then of course the, the answer is like, well, if someone's going to do it, it's better if I do it or else the wrong people are going to do it. Like we're in this runaway tr.

Whether it's the Constitution, whether it's art when people are together creating art when you're in a symphony. Right.

And my parents did not let me watch television when I was growing up because they were convinced that, that it was the end of any focus. But we used to have appointment viewing. Everyone would wait to see next week. As a generation, as a community, you're waiting to see what's going to happen with Heather Locklear on the next episode of Melrose Place. People were talking about it. Things got revealed. The last time we really had that, I think was Game of Thrones in a significant way. So basically everyone used to wait, what's the new episode? What's going to happen next week? And as soon as we went to streaming, it's like, oh, this is so, so great, right? Netflix drops a whole season. I get everything at once. I don't have to wait. But I can't talk to almost anybody about any of the TV shows that I'm watching, aside from saying, oh, I'm watching White Lotus season one. And they're like, oh, wait till you get to season two. Well, don't tell me anything, right? I don't want spoiler alerts. I don't want to talk to you because I don't know what you've seen. And we're in these different buckets already. And it's like, that's to our benefit. You know, when I'm home sometimes, I mean, and I click on Apple tv, there's like a half a trillion dollars worth of entertainment on the tv. But at times, none of that feels special. It's like I have too much access to too many things. It's not like I'm waiting for next summer when Return of the Jedi is going to come out, right? Or I'm standing in line for four hours to watch Tim Burton, to get into Tim Burton's Batman on opening night. And so we're fragmented. So now with AI, let's take it one step further, right? Well, I want my. So my book series is called Orphan X, right? There's one book that comes out every year. Everyone can talk about it. In my community, I go out on a book tour. Well, what happens with AI when everyone can have their own version written for them, right? Where they say, well, I want Orphan X book, but I don't want any harsh language and I don't want any threat to children, and I want to adjust the words down to a high school reading level, and I want it 30% shorter. Okay? Bing. There's your orphanax. And somebody else says, well, I like the real violence. I want it more grotesque, and I want it to be, you know, epic and longer. So there's theirs and there's theirs. And so you do the same thing with music, right? And we start to do the same thing with all of our AI interactions. We're doing a version of this with our friends, of who we're liking and unliking, right? We're curating our relationships, we're curating our communities. We're getting rid of things we don't like. What if we say, well, I want to hear from my uncle, my crazy uncle, but I don't want to hear anything that is his political views or anything that's politically adjacent, right? So now what comes in, and it could be overtaxed over social media is my safe version, I think safe of him, my uncle and my."}

So all five of your family members are reading a different news story that hits their trigger, their emotional triggers differently. Everyone's reading different news.

It's rewarding, but challenging for me to go have a conversation with, let's call it ten of the most, you know, brilliant conservative minds in the Western world about religion, you know, about the Old Testament. It's a different kind of corner of the universe where these ideas are being. And it's a range of ideas, right? It's like Ben Shapiro's very different than Os, Guinness is very different than you is very different from. And there's this kind of whole range of different ideas. And there's so much where you have to modulate between holding your center and accommodating new ideas and having humility, but remembering there's a very firm disagreement with some aspect of somebody's of thinking.

So I work with a woman called Samara Ali, who's a. Who's a. A brilliant international mediator and. International. Right. She helped mediate the Syrian civil war. And one of the things she talks about is how we're creating. You can see when we start to create an authorizing environment for violence. Right. And we all know what that looks like, right. If you, if you, if we turn on cable news and choose your home team. Right. Language is increasingly aggressive. The other side is increasingly a dehumanized monolith. And then there's a lot of words that are edging towards violence or, or towards the suggestion of violence by which I am not implying that words are violence or that that should be shut down or that we shouldn't have free speech. I'm suggesting none of that. But I think we understand as we're looking that we've been creating an environment where, you know, cities can get burned down and one people don't understand that, where the husband of the speaker of the House can get, you know, battered with a hammer. And people might make jokes about it like we're, we're. We're inching into some pretty uncomfortable territory. And the solution for this is to create an authorizing environment for negotiation, compromise, right? Civil disagreement, opposing views. And so my hope is that, you know, one of the things I wrote a book that takes place in mind control cults and why went in and undercover to mind control cults to research it. And one of the principles that mind control cults operate by is called pluralistic ignorance.

For the fact that we're risking what we call cancellation or kind of outrage or reputational financial damage. But there's some of that, right? It's not, it's not a super easy endeavor for a bunch of people who think differently to come together and do this.

There might be some people, you know, the Daily Wire subscribers are probably not going to be as aligned with me on average for some of my political views. But ideally, if they see me there talking and engaging in a different way, there's an understanding that we can have negotiations and disagreements in ways that are much more civil than we're seeing in social media, maybe in the world, and vice versa is the hope. And by doing this and by trying to model thinking and talking from kind of different perspectives, even as you and I do, you know, in our Friendship and in our public engagements, whether we're, you know, like berating Jordan for his tweets, you know, and berating is the wrong word, right? It's like. It's like a loving discussion about ways that he might be able to more maximize the ability for people to hear his wisdom is the fair version.

I'm so dysregulated emotionally, I can't possibly talk to Jonathan Pageau because here's an interpretation of the worst thing he's ever said, and I can't even comprehend it. He must be deplatformed. He can't be listened to. Right. Or with me. And instead to recognize that not just that, but also the ways we might be prevaricating in our own communities to kind of fit in, because we really need in group protection right now. It's really not safe to not have an in group that's got your back right now. And so are there certain ways where you think, well, this part's gone too far on the right for too much purity. This thing's gone too far for the left and too much hybridization. But I can't say anything because I don't want to be those other guys. I'm not going to be that across. I'm going to just let that go. And it's like speaking truth, right? That's the. That's our Solzhenitsyn, Right? Like, don't say little lies all the time.

So it's like, I think of, let's say, a family, for example, and that you realize that, you know, in a family, if you want the family to function, you have to. You have to kind of let some things go because it is, in some ways, the inner group. And you also have to kind of iron over some of the pleats like some of the things that are, that are complicated or else, you know, it's going to get stuck and it's going to not. The wheel is not going to keep turning. But then at some point that can become a problem. Right? You know, if you have serious problematic patterns in your family and you keep ironing them over and you keep ignoring them and you keep kind of wanting to, to smooth it out so that things function, then. Then at some point it can, it can lead you into, into disease really into a disease pattern. And so you have to find that weird balance. And it has to do with, in some ways with that weird balance between something like rigor and mercy. Something like, you know, focus and, and, and openness. Like if you. It's like a dance that you have to play so that you don't you avoid the dangers of, of either. Because the thing about, like the thing about. Because sometimes when I hear someone's like, just say that. Tell the truth. It's like when I hear that, I'm like, well.

And so one of the things that's so interesting for me, it was so illuminating to read Exodus with. With so many scholars. And I hadn't visited it in depth since. Since high school, really. In. In really kind of any kind of depth. But one of the things is, we're talking about how the narrative structure. What struck me, coming from novels and screenplays and such, is just looking at it. There's so much attention that's paid in building this up into procedural memory. That's the memory. If you get cracked in the head and you lose your speech, you still know how to ride a bike. It's the lowest level of memory that you lose because it's like, here's what's going to happen in the story. Here's the story that just happened. This is sort of the structure of a lot of the things, right? Here's. Here's what's going to happen and what's coming. Here's the event that happened. And now we're going to describe the event that just happened. Well, for a straight narrative story, for a screenplay, right? Everyone be falling asleep.

And as they describe it on the whiteboard, you cut forward in time to it as they're describing it, right? We're not. You don't want to tell an Audience, those things. Okay, so why is it procedural memory? Well, part of what I've been thinking about, it's like it's asking us to be every single character in every single story. So it's not like we all just get to be Moses. We're all also the Pharaoh, right? So when you're talking about figuring out, you know, like, do you sweep too many things under the rug or are you too confrontational? Right? Are you too authoritarian? Are you too permissive? Like, we don't all just get to be Moses. We're also Aaron, right? We're also like, you know, God comes down with his. With thundering revelation with Moses, and Moses is like, hey, man, I'll be right back. Like, don't do anything dumb. And they're like, let's build a golden calf and have orgies, right? It's like, he's not even around the corner yet. And we're all of those things, right? We're trying to strive upward, but we also are failing. And. And if we try to really embody them, which is what procedural memory is, it's the embodiment of a story. But we're all the different characters. And, you know, that's also true when it comes to the Gospels, right? It's like we're all Judas. We don't all just get to be Jesus. Yeah, everyone, right? We're all the parts of that and all of these reflections. And I think that's so much of why it's shoving it into our spinal cords, the very manner that we're saying it. It's ritual. It's like, you're all going to fail. You're all going to build the golden calf and have proverbial orgies or literal orgies, I suppose. You know, you're all gonna. But you have to constantly renegotiate and figure out the different veils of meaning and figure out the appropriate levels as you try to progress ever imperfectly upward. Right? And we're all going to have failings to hold things together, and we're not all going to reach the ultimate ideal within our lifetime."}

And what's so interesting for me, there's a sort of comfort in that, too, because it's like, you know, one of the things I say is I'm. I'm. I'm liberal. A classical liberal, right. In a lot of ways. Well, why is that? Like, part of that's genetics. Part of that's my big five personality structure. Like, if I do the testing, I'M like blown wide open in openness. Like I'm as high as you can test in openness. That's a very big liberal trait, right. I'm also an artist and part of that's my environment, right. Then part of that's like there's all these things and for so many aspects, like when I've delved into the culture or into politics or into really an exploration of things, one of the things that I realized is like I'm coming from my own little lens right on the world. That's the result of my experience, genetics, environment and personality structure. We all do and we all have different lenses. And all those different lenses are what let us view the common world. If we're doing it in a way that's more comprehensive as opposed to we have our own lenses and we just feed them. You know those really cool shots in the Matrix where it goes all the way around in slow motion sequence. Like how they do that is they set up a giant like arc of different cameras so that something's being shot from every angle simultaneously. We all have these different lenses and if we can integrate them, we get a very three dimensionalized view of a situation. Well, guess what? That's how we navigate complex change in the world as a culture, right? We can't navigate it with this set of cameras that are predominantly conservative or this set of cameras that are prominently liberal, whatever."}

So if you think about a family meal is a good example where, you know, the structure, the actual ritualization of the family meal is creating outside of thought the balanced relationships between the different types of people and the different types of possible human interactions. Right? So it's like we're eating together. There's certain things we know we have to do. Like you don't make noise when you're eating. You have to be able to, you have to like speak, but listen, but you still have to finish your meal. So it's like all of this is being, being played together. You don't want to take too much food, you want to leave stuff from others. You're checking to see if everybody's got enough. And so it's like all this type of very, very embodied action is structuring the way in which you should act more in a more, let's say intellectual or social in a looser way. Right. And that ultimately religious rituals have. It's not the only function they have, but one of the functions. That's what they have. So like Sabbath, you know, getting together on Sunday, worshiping together, processions, all this stuff is, is doing that for people. I don't know if you, how. What do you think about that?"}
{"episode_id":"SW - #278 - 2023-03-16 - Gregg Hurwitz - New Think","start":3341.78,"end":3549.88,"speaker":"Greg Hurwitz","text":"Well, it's really interesting and it's, it's along the lines of what I'm talking about a little bit is. So that's really, that's, that's really interesting. So let's think about it this way, right? Like, so that example I gave of the Matrix, right? So let's say there's a mini version of that at your table. Table. Like you're sitting around a dinner table and you want to kind of accommodate the reality and story of your family and how your family exists in the culture within all the perspectives. And so when I was describing me and all the things that lead to me having or arriving more naturally at a liberal mindset, the more that I approach any topic with humility, right? And I'm not suggesting I'm good at this, right, but this is, it's a muscle we're always building, right? That's different. The more that I become, the more that I have a three dimensionalized version of whatever the topic is. And so there's a lot of times where I'm like, look, I feel like if I was the perfectly embodied human, if I had sufficient humility and understanding and grace, I'd be exactly 50% liberal and conservative, right? That's the yin yang. And that sign line, that the, the sine wave between it is where you want to be between order and chaos. And the little eyeballs are the kind of feet, that's colossus of roads standing astride that. And so it tends to be like, I had a really funny. I'll give you just a quick example. I had a really funny conversation with a elected Republican congressman and we were talking about like infrastructure and regulation. And he said, you know, you liberals think every time that we want to roll back in regulations, it's so because we want to dump toxins in rivers. And I just laughed and I was like, you're completely right. That's exactly what I think. Right. Every time that I read a headline and it says like this environmental regulations rolled back, I'm like, it's just big business, right, Trying to like dump stuff. And so, you know, then I did an exploration with a whole bunch of stuff and of course, like, we do need some regulations, but they're Way too overburdened. And some are ridiculous, and some make like it's way more nuanced than my little approach it led to believe. And so I think that what we want to be eventually is all the cameras that are filming Keanu Reeves, right, Doing his little limbo move. We want to be all the perspectives at our table. And in some ways, the wisdom that we want to embody, or the grace, I think is the best word for it we want to embody at our table is to understand and integrate all the perspectives of the family, right. And use kind of minimal possible force and have the discussion and the influence be freely entered into. Per Oz is freely entered into covenant. Right. And the more that we can embody, the more views. It's like, it's all the same thing, right? We don't get to read a gospel and be like, hey, I'm just going to be Jesus. I'm not going to be Judas in my reading of this story. Because that's just. That's just how I identify. It's like, I don't care how you identify, right? You don't get to just be Moses and not be the Pharaoh if you're reading a story and paying attention. You don't just get to be you and not your daughter. You don't just get to be you and not your wife's perspective. Yeah. But you can't lose yourself into that either. So how do you hold your lens and understand all of the lenses? And we do that. We have an integration, right, of all the mosaic pieces that we can step back from our natural proclivities, but also behold a bigger picture. And that bigger picture is what helps us navigate towards health or prosperity or at least towards the least awful misery when suffering arises."}

So the reason why I brought up the meal is that what I'm trying to push for is I'm trying to push for the idea that if you talk about procedural memory and procedural, you know, procedural participation, there's a sense in which there's a lower aspect to this, like a more grounded aspect. But is. But I think ultimately is looking up higher, which is something like, if you know how to pass. And this. It's going to sound boring when I say it, but it's like. Like if you know to pass food down the table, right? And if you know to be watching other people's glasses to make sure that they've got enough water, enough wine or. Or whatever, if you have that attention, which is very grounded and that, you know, you. You're attentive enough to make sure that everybody gets a little chance to speak even before the content of what we're saying, that there is a embodied procedural reality that's ritualized that makes it possible. For the other part, because what I'm trying to help people understand, it's like I'm really trying to help secular people understand religious ritual, like, why religious ritual is useful. And so the idea is that, because you mentioned it before, like, if we stand together and we sing together, right? In a choir, for example. Especially in a choir where, let's say you're in a choir and you've got different voices and everybody kind of has to follow their voice and then. But also be attentive to the other voice because you want to stay in line with what the others are singing. That, that. That behavior, doing that, practicing that will make it easier for you to then scale that up into the meaning. Like the actual explicit meaning world where. Where you can then discuss with someone. But it. It's actually grounded in a deeper thing. Like, it could. It could be other. Other things, like playing a sport together, you know, that kind of thing. Playing games together. If you play games together, then all of a sudden you. There's a kind of. There's a kind of ethic of the game, which is not political. It's not ideological. There's nothing about it. But if you embody the ethic of the game, it puts you in a space where you're able. Then it trains you to be able to interact with others, and it trains."}

If we want to see all the ritual, all the things that they have to do to get embodied in a particular space, right? There's so many cues before you're going to step in and engage in a game, which then needs to proceed in a certain way that's harmonious. No, I think that's. I think that that's right. And if we don't. If we don't set those cues, right. Like, I remember I had double hip surgery about, like, eight, nine years ago. And so I was going, like, as part of rehab, like, a year in. I was starting to go to yoga, which now I love. I do like, you know, hot yoga. 110 degrees and whatever. But, you know, it's not like I was good at it. It wasn't anything that was natural. But it was really funny because I was, like, working when I first was going, and I'd go driving down there and I'd get, like, all aggravated if somebody was taking long in front of me in line, right?

It's like. It's like there's a flag. There's just, you know, a parade, there's a potluck. There's. Whatever it is that.

When we try to, like when we politicize holidays, for example, too much, then it. It can't do that. Like, it tends to. Whichever way you.

And it's like people have a ton of trust in the religious institution institutions who are in the secular world any more than people in the religious institutions have a lot of trust in the secular world. And what's happening, you know, it's like. But everyone's got to come back to the table and stitch together. But what we've seen. I see this so much in the arts, right? It's like, for me, there's a very clear value structure when I'm writing, and it's like art politics. If you flip them, you're doing propaganda. Yeah, Right. So I've helped politically. I've written speeches and commercials for candidates or people or causes that I agree with. But I'm very clear when I'm doing that, that doesn't come into books or screenplays or comics. And if you subvert it and if I'm. If I'm pretending to tell you a story, but I'm really indoctrinating you just a little bit in ideology, you're going to get angry, and rightly so, because that's not why you're coming to read a comic or a book or many people, some people just want to read propaganda.

And it's good that you bring up storytelling. Right. And because storytelling also, if you have proper storytelling, it does end up being not in the. Not in the argumentative state, not in the state of dialectic, let's say, but it's in. It's in the state of procedural relationship. And so you follow a character through events in their lives and you identify with them and then you. You're challenged or all of this. That's. That. That's something that is. Has a universal quality that can help us then train ourselves for the. For the other stuff. But you're right. I mean, you can see it. That's why. I mean, that's why right now it's I mean, so.

Who's conservative, pretty conservative, right? He said something really funny. He was like, look, in terms of watching the Oscars or something, he's like, I don't want to turn on the TV and watch a bunch of people tell me how stupid I am. And part of this in some ways is it's like I don't want to take my politics and moral leadership from artists. I want to take, like, wonder and awe and contrast and shock and surprise, right? And. And be jarred into ways of thinking from some chaotic vision, right. I don't want to read Faulkner and figure out then, you know, how to think like Faulkner writes about race in America. It's just unbelievable, right? Southern, Southern writer. He's just so nuanced. It's so, like, spectacular. It just feels like it's turning your brain inside out, you know, or you read Richard Wright, you know, like you're read when you're reading real art. It shouldn't be neat solutions. And I think part of that is a loss of sacred rituals. I'm going to expand the term a little bit, but for me, it's. When I'm writing, I'm trying to engage. And, you know, I think for you, obviously, when you're carving, obviously your subject matter is also more more specifically or more closely aligned with the sacred. But you. We have to hold those spaces in other ways. Like, I have to have my writing or my art as something that's sacred, that's set above everything. El. If I subvert it to the political, right, if I subvert it too much to the commercial, it doesn't work. It becomes something else than what it's supposed to be. And so in a world where we're kind of denigrating hierarchies with some haphazard and where everything's political, all things are political. We're losing the different aspects of our society that actually anchor it. Like, the arts should speak differently to politics or should have a different place in the conversation, right? Than politics do. Education should have a different place than politics do. Faith should have a different place than politics, too. But if we see schools embodying ideology, if we see, you know, faith communities becoming overtly politicized with one side, if we see art and entertainment in Hollywood start to get hidebound ideologically in a Different direction. All of a sudden it's everywhere we look and it's just, it's a capture. Because I think that's the easiest lever force for the hate industrial complex, right? Cable news, fundraising letters from politicians, social media, that's the easiest lever for outrage and terror and fear to have us just hit and be glued to. If we can turn everything about that right. Did this movie do the wrong thing politically? Right. It's just hitting the lever. Did this person do this? Are we using, you know, do you have the proper stove? Are you adhering to the right regulations? Right. Did the right movie get this award? If we can turn everything into that. It's a constant churn of judgment and hate and outrage and insecurity and terror. And also there's a real pride to it too, because then we all feel like we've cast ourselves in this immensely virtuous role in some moral pageant, right? Where we're all, you know, standing forth against the inequities of the ages or, you know, we're the last voice against mouth breathing reprobate seeking to tear apart the fabric of society. On the other side, that's a terrifying monolith that can't be distinguished in reality. It's like, dude, you're tweeting, you're not doing anything special, right? You're tweeting into a void and you're probably talking to a bunch of St. Petersburg troll farms. Right? Or like, you know, it's, we're not doing what we think we're doing.

Not in, like, the modern sense of it, but, like, I have so many different communities or friends with really, really differing viewpoints, you know, and that's challenging. It's not. It's not. It didn't used to be as challenging as it is now because there's so much distrust, you know, but, like, learning to really negotiate that, to really try to understand. And see, like, you talked about when you get angry in your family and then you let anger out, but then you see the effect it has, right? And then you have to pull back. It's like, if you're doing that in different communities or different groups, especially in this environment where we're so. Where there's so much distrust and there's so much tribalism, it's pretty. It's amazing. Because it really, for me, I feel so much kind of undeniable reality to not turn any one group of people into a monolith. Because once you turn people into a monolith, you dehumanize them. So you can talk about, well, the regressive left, right, or the resentful right. But it's like, there's so much nuance everywhere. And if you're in real relation with people with really differing views, like, you know, look, Jordan, I've been friends a long time. I mean, it's been more than half my life at this point. So many people are like, you know, here's what a tweet he said, like, how could you be friends with him? Right. How could you not? And it's like, well, like, you think you disagree with him. We have tons of disagreements. Right. Some of them even public. I always think, like, imagine being so limited in the scope of your imagination that you think that you'd want to be friends with Jordan Peterson and agree with him on everything. What, like, why would I want to have a relationship with you? To try and, like, win you into my full set of views rather than have an engagement. Right. It's like, there's so many things to learn and figure out and see differently and to hold the respect that we all come from different viewpoints, Big five personality traits, genetics, experience, and to really try to embody that, to try and listen. And, you know, that's so much of what we're doing when we engage with story. Like, we're taking our nervous systems. We're trying to listen and take our nervous systems out for a test run. We don't have to be the ones who get eaten by a bear. Right. Or nailed to a cross. Like, we. We get to try to experience this and see what it is. And parts of being in community are that way, too. And if we lose that muscle to want to really understand and embody what somebody said. The other thing is that it requires a lot of security to be able to contain your own emotion about whatever political, polarizing opinions you come from, to really open up and let another perspective come in and come through. Yeah. You know, and Carl Rogers talked about that, the psychologist. He was the one who, you know, he was the one everyone makes fun of. Of like, well, how did that make you feel? Right, that he's that psychologist."}

Rogers sat him up. You're sitting face to face. You're looking at somebody. And one of the things he did was he talked about how, like, to really listen, you have to embody with empathy in your nervous system, almost like what is being told. But then you have to have security. You're not going to lose yourself. Right. And all of a sudden come out and be like, I'm not going to come out of Exodus.

To get as little as I possibly can to make sure I'm always leading with everything that I think first?

You're going to leave on tour for your new orphanax book. All right. And so one of the things that I found interesting about that is, you know, we were talking about AI and the problem of this idiosyncratic novel. And you also have a way with Orphan X. Like, you have a charity that is related to Orphan X that is kind of trying to connect into the world. So I'd love for you to just talk a little bit about that because I think it is an interesting way because sometimes, like, we talk about AI and like, the danger of it coming and like, we shouldn't, we shouldn't. What do we do? And so I think that you found some interesting ways to connect your literary work into the real world, to give people a sense of participation and community in something that's more than just a novel, Right?"}
{"episode_id":"SW - #278 - 2023-03-16 - Gregg Hurwitz - New Think","start":4668.52,"end":4867.06,"speaker":"Greg Hurwitz","text":"So look, as we were talking about that, I mean, really over these last weeks, as we're thinking about this fragmentation with AI, you know, one of the things that occurred to me was, you know, I want to have part of what is going to be special or worthwhile about this, about my writing, about me as a novelist. If pretty soon we can have AI write novels, it's like we can have arguments about the spark of the. Of the divine in humans, right? Like, there's a human governing aspect to. For when you create a novel or a series of novels. But I think in some ways the thing that's the most important, that's at the bottom of it. I mean, it's really obvious in a lot of ways, but it's community. It's the fact that everybody reads the same book, right? I write one Orphan X book a year, and the books are really about. I mean, Orphan X, for those of you who haven't read it, you know, he's a. He was taken out of a foster home at the age of 12 as like a very unwanted member of humanity and trained to be an assassin. And off the books assassin for the U.S. government. He was trained up basically to be an expendable weapon. And one of the things that his handler, he's a CIA handler who raises him kind of in isolation and, and puts him through very, very rigorous testing and training. But he tells him early on, and he actually really loves Evan. And that's one of the things that's a bit different about this, isn't just that he's trained. It's traumatic and awful. It's also the best thing that ever happened to him because it's the first time somebody treated him with love and care. But so Jack Johns, who's Orphan X's handler and father figure, Orphan X's name is Evan Smoke, he says to him when he's 12, the hard part isn't going to be turning you into a killer. The hard part is going to be keeping you human. And so the series is very much about his process of being trained under these. He has like the Assassin's Ten Commandments, right, that he's never supposed to break, but it's very much about the process of him shattering through into a different understanding of. One of the things I say is he never learned the strange language of intimacy. It's almost like he's Pinocchio and he wants to be a real boy. And so it's the process of his becoming. It's the process of him learning to be human in a lot of ways. And so the thing that's the most, I think, important about this is that everyone's not reading a different storyline that's designed just for them. Once a year, everybody can read the same story that comes out. And that's, that's what a fan base is. That's what readers are. That's what community is. That's who shows up when I'm on book tour. We're all there to talk about and discuss one arc that's happening. But one of the other things that that happens that I set up is that Orphan X, as you mentioned, there's. There's a charity. So he basically left the program. It's called the orphan program, at some point because those two things, being human and being a killer, are like trains on a collision course. And he essentially becomes a pro bono assassin, like so he can align it with his own moral compass. He's got unlimited resources. He's got an insane skill set. And basically he will help people who are being terrorized by other humans who have nowhere to turn and there's no way the law can protect them. And so he has an encrypted line phone number. It's 1-855-2- nowhere. And if you, you can call it and you can see if he answers it in the real world. And every time he answers that phone, he says, do you need my help? And so I started a foundation called do you need my help foundation where we go into local communities."}

{"episode_id":"SW - #278 - 2023-03-16 - Gregg Hurwitz - New Think","start":4874.1,"end":5118.59,"speaker":"Greg Hurwitz","text":"But basically, you know, I, I do, I do a lot of democracy unit and unity building work pro bono. And so one of the things that we do is we go into through organization called millions of conversations. I mentioned the partner I work with in that whose name is Samar Ali, who started it. And we go into really left behind counties in a program and build kind of community leaders to then have them figure out what problems they want to solve. And then we bring in experts in rural economic development and mediation to try and help them out of it. And so really what it is, is we're trying to teach them to fish again, right in this new world where everything has conspired to leave them behind. But one of the things is, is while you're teaching someone to fish, you also need to give them fish, right? Or they're. And so do you need my help? Is something that I set up that's just a stop gap for some of those things where it's like, you know, we had one family in the first place we went was in a Grundy county. That's the most, it's the, the poorest county in Tennessee. And when we went there, I went there two weeks before the midterm elections and nobody mentioned Donald Trump or Joe Biden or midterms or January 6th or China or immigration. All that they were talking about was, I don't have enough gas in my car to drive 35 miles to talk to social services, to get food stamps, to feed my kid. Like, the problems they're dealing with were so concrete that there's no room for all the stuff that we're screaming about on CNN and Fox News. And so there was, for instance, one of the first, the first kind of grant we made was there was a couple there, young couple, his car broke down. There's no public transportation, right. The roads are terrible. His car broke down. He lost his job because he couldn't drive to work. His landlord kicked him out. They had a newborn baby who developed a respiratory infection and the landlord poured bleach all over their possessions as kind of revenge for them not paying the rent. So there's this young couple with a newborn who, who've always worked, right. He's always worked up until now, who are literally out on the streets. And then you get into all these regulations, right, and issues. So there's local charities who were there, but all of their funding can't go towards kind of this relief in this particular example. Like they can pay for certain different programs, but there's, there was nothing there where the money had been earmarked to help them. So we just stepped in and got them a motel room for three weeks while the task force scrambled on the ground there and eventually got them a place in longer term housing that didn't open up yet. But they would have been homeless, right? Got the baby medical care, gave them a base so they had somewhere to sleep, and then they got moved into longer term care or longer term housing. And then the husband applied for a job in the military, right. And then needed some help because he failed the math part. So we have somebody who's a military veteran who's amazing, who's one of the founders of millions of conversations. And so we can point them to resources. And so it's just sort of like when, when, when this little family kind of fell off the curb into the gutter. It's just this little assist to pick them up and put them back on the curb again, right? And there's. There's other stuff. We have like a bunch of floods destroyed schools in Tennessee, and one of the schools just got wiped out. And we're going to go in and just put in like a rural computer lab. I'm sorry, a computer lab for this rural high school. Right. That lost all of that for the students. So we're trying to go in while. While this longer action plan is kind of being built up. And that's called do you need my help foundation, so that the readers and the community of orphan X readers can also kind of participate. And also then the cycle of charity and gratitude stays in the community. Right. It's. It's given by and chosen by the task force. Not by me. Right. Not by me. Outside the community. Right. So that everything stays within there. And so it's just another way to try and stitch this community together around the story. And the story ultimately is about helping people. Though, of course, it's a thriller, so he's, you know, executing."}

I mean, I don't know how consciously you're doing it, but it's basically, you set up a narrative that is, of course, extreme because it's in the story world. It's about assassins, about this. But then you set up a structure, and then you're trying to help that structure inspire people and giving them a path for it to inspire people into their real life. Because, I mean, the problem of entertainment is often that it can be. It can just be a. A supplement or it can just replace actual virtuous action. Right? So it's like I could.

You screaming at your hated politician or celebrity of choice, like, what's the cause? You're real. You're really worried about.

Do you really care about, like, what's happening at the border or immigration or, you know, how are you trying to fix that from whatever side you're coming from? Right? Like, what's the action that you're doing? And you're right. It can sometimes just be blowing off. Off steam. But you know, with storytelling and I've always thought in stories like a lot of that is trying to challenge myself really because I'm not. I don't always know what the characters are going to do. I don't know how things will turn out. I'm not just filling in the blanks when I'm writing a story. So it's trying to be about kind of growth out of the chaotic some organization into some new version of order. But the more that I can have that community around me both online and there's a good use of online like when I'm online I try and be about the books and stories and joy and reading and. Right. It's a. There that's a nice way to have an established online community and use social media at least for me. And when I'm on tour seeing people who show up right who are interested in talking about ideas, who are interested in talking about orphanacs and then trying to do a bit of good in these communities while also deferring to and having humility that the communities will know how to help themselves better than I will. Right. We need to go get the local. We need to get the ground truth in those communities to choose where to put those resources. I can't just come in from the outside and say I've determined everybody needs education.
