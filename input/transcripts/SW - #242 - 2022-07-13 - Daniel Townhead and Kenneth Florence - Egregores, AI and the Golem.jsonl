There's a feeling that it gives you that, that you can detect.

The experience of the sacred is something which is not totally you, which is pulling you into something else. And so you can use. You could use this weird, uncanny sense to create a kind of perversion of the sacred. This is Jonathan Peugeot. Welcome to the Symbolic World. So, hello everybody. I'm here with Ken, Florence and Daniel Townhead. Ken and Daniel wrote an article recently for the Symbolic World blog on Egregore. There were two articles, actually. And for those who have been following the discussion on my channel with John Vervaeke, with Paul Vanderklye, there's this big discussion about the question of agentic beings or transpersonal beings, or there's all these ways of trying to name them. The idea that there is some kind of agency beyond the human level. Of course, for religious thinkers, this is something that isn't surprising to us. But for people coming out of materialism or people who have lived in a secular materialist world, it's difficult. People kind of perceive it. I think more and more people can see it, but they're struggling to find the right words to distinguish between these different types of manifestations of agency at something which is beyond the personal level. And so people were using words like egregore and using different ideas. And I critiqued it. And Ken and Daniel really did the work in which into the terms research where their history was in terms of who came up with these words, how they've been used historically. And they came up with some pretty interesting and good critiques about my own takes, about different people's takes. And so I thought it would be a great opportunity to continue this discussion with them. So, guys, thanks for coming on."}

So in our first essay, we took a look at the concept of Egregores. And it basically means watchers or wakeful in Greek. And it's named after the fallen angels of the Book of Enoch. But we see that they originally referred to spiritual beings that were invoked by occult groups. But this concept developed into an imagining of Egregor's as like a manifestation of collective will or collective behavior. And in this way they became entities that were associated with the idea of emergence. So after we established this, we then attempted to describe Christian cosmology as it is held by yourself and the symbolic world community and see that because reality is conceived as a continuous hierarchy of being with an origin and purpose in God, purely emergent beings or entities can't really exist. But at this point in writing the essay, we discovered a pretty exciting detail. We found that a quote in a 20th century text that had been very influential in creating the idea of the emergent Egregore excluded an important paragraph. And this paragraph described the creation of Tibetan Buddhist tulpas, which the author asserts are equivalent to Egregore's in ways which any follower of yourself and Matthieu would recognize as behavior which is kind of giving body to higher beings. And so this in brief, along with some other evidence, leads us to simply reassert the identity of Egregor's with the watchers of the Book of Enoch and thus assert that the concept doesn't necessarily threaten Christian cosmology at all."}

And we were kind of just seeing it as an exploration. And you know, speaking for myself personally, at this point, I still don't really have a dog in the fight. Like, I think that I think we should just come out and say it like Like, I think that. I don't think that the term is necessary, but I do think that there are certain contexts in which it's helpful. And I think in that headless entity category is one place where I do think that the word egregore is potentially helpful."}

Like how we normally use the term or traditionally use the term versus how it's kind of increasingly come to be used in the higher beings conversation. Right. So from a traditional Christian perspective, the way we normally use the word being refers to the living entities of the creaturely world, right? So that's earthly and souled entities and angels. Right. And the angels are the beings that constitute the realm of heaven, basically. And one thing about earthly creatures, at least, is that each can be said to kind of serve as a sort of unified locus of experience. Right? So there's. Sam Harris says this a lot. There. There is ostensibly something like it is like to be that creature. Right. So. And we can probably equally say that there's something it's like to be an angel as well. Maybe we can dispute that later on, but for now, let's just maybe take that as a given. But the question is, can we extend that same kind of qualitative experience to the structures that the angels and demons give body to? Right. Like, is there something it's like to be a football team, Right. Is there something it's like to be a city or. Or the Mars Rover, Right. You and John Vervaeke had that conversation about the Mars Rover and your angels, or what was the video, the scientific description of angels."}

If there isn't something it's like to be those entities, then we kind of have to ask ourselves the question of whether it really makes sense to call those in between entities beings. Right? So that was the first big issue that we kind of uncovered in the, in the second article, the second complication, and please stop me if I'm getting too in the weeds too soon. The second complication that the article discusses involves multiplicity versus identity. So we asked the question, when a new man made structure comes into being, is it in all cases the manifestation of some pre existent unified principle? Is there some kind of heavenly prototype for something like Instagram? In the article we used the example of the New York Stock Exchange. Or is it better to say that this new entity is in some way a combination of pre existent principles? And if that's the case, are higher beings sort of assembling in the spiritual domain to bring these structures into manifestation? Because if so, we have a kind of like emergence in the spiritual domain, and that's the very thing that we're kind of trying to get rid of in the material."}

In all cases. So in the article we kind of implicitly suggest the answer that with man made structures all have a kind of logos, which is expressed in the structure to varying degrees. So in structures where there's a high degree of logos, tropos, mismatch, where the idea of the structure is off from the way it's actually manifesting, then we have a kind of ascribed identity. So we point to Instagram, we point to the New York Stock Exchange and we give it a name. But we're suggesting that whatever divine principle might be at its core, right, how God intended that thing to come into being is being hidden from us to a degree and kind of replaced by a sort of mixture or confusion of angelic and demonic principles. And that kind of brings us to our like our headless designation, right? So we're saying that, okay, maybe an appropriate way to use the word egregore is for these like giant collective structures that human beings participate in, but whose ontological grounding, as it were, is questionable. Right? So it's like whatever angel might be sort of ontologically at the head is being relegated to the background and it's being kind of replaced by a sort of confusion."}

And to clarify Some things. And you'll see when we put out the discussion with John and Jordan that's coming out soon, we talk about three types of beings. You could say that is, one would be a regular being that is, let's say, a being that is aligned with the will of God. Let's call it that way. Like, so a being that exists in higher being. So a being that exists in higher loves. You're living inside a family. You honor your parents, you honor the king. You also worship Christ. Everything is aligned. And you accept that you exist in these higher principalities. And so you're kind of aligned in a way that makes everything fit together. So, you know, you have this image. You have this image going both ways. You see that in a lot of Taoist statements. But would you find them in a lot of Eastern statements? You know, the idea that, like, if you're. If the king is well in his heart, then the kingdom will do well. And there's this like, sense of like, if you're well in your heart, then your family will do well, then the city will do well, then the kingdom will do well. And so there's this alignment, and so there's that. Then there's what we could call parasitic beings. And so parasitic beings are those that exist in pride for themselves. And so what they do is they actually threaten their higher participation. So we talked about addictions, we talked about, you know, the idea of someone in a bureaucracy that is acting only for their own interest. And therefore they're taking the resources of that being, using it just for their own interest and without, you know, and so their actions are actually threatening the world in which they live, like, because they're acting only for their own self interest. And then you would have something which would look more like more chaotic, headless beings that you talked about, which are like these loose associations that don't seem to have a real telos or they have approximations of telos. So it really helped us to kind of talk about these a bit different. But with you guys, what I didn't say in that conversation, which is what I'll say in this, is that to me, that seems to fit the Christian ontology perfectly. So St. Gregory of Nyssa in Life of Moses, he has a. I won't quote it directly, I'll paraphrase it. He has a wonderful quote where he talks about how non being is that which things that think they have their own being are non being. And those that basically are rooted in God because God is the Christ is true being. And so for you, to have true being, you must be rooted in. In the incarnation. That is what you have to be rooted in. And then true being kind of flows from that. And so there's a sense in which all beings that aren't aligned towards the incarnation, that aren't allied towards the summit of the mountain, what they will appear as is either parasitical or headless, because that's what they are, right? Because they are trying to self exist. Then they become these parasitic, headless beings. And so the idea, for example, of wondering about demons that, let's say, manage certain aspects of reality. And when we look at it, it looks chaotic and messy. It's like, that's because it is chaotic and messy. That's why demons are represented as chimera. That's why demons are represented as hybrids and mixtures of different categories, because that, in a way, that's what they are. So then the idea of egregore is something like that, then that seems to make sense. Something which doesn't seem to have its alignment properly. So because it doesn't have a proper alignment, it appears it's something which is colonized by different intelligences. And so it's struggling to. So think about it like you, when you don't know what to do. Like I don't know what to do. I want to do this, I want to do that, I want to do that. And so I'm paralyzed by all these, you know, I'm being colonized by all these different possibilities. And so I can't. I can't act properly in the world, let's say. Or then there's a parasitic one, which is that I get so obsessed with the lower good, a low, a lower good that I am, that I spiral into this, like, weird. What is it that John Vervecki calls it? Reciprocal, like narrowing or whatever."}

Where you kind of narrow into these, like, smaller goods and then you. Then it ends up devouring you. It ends up basically paralyzing you. So anyway, so that's what I kind of came out of your critiques. I don't know if that, at least that makes sense in terms of what you saw as the issue with these different ways of seeing."}

And it sounds like we're going to be introducing some new terms and concepts to help the conversation be more flexible. And I think that flexibility was what I felt maybe was lacking a little bit in the conversation up to now. But the big thing that was present in our essays, which maybe might be even missing from the account of these three entities, which does make a huge amount of sense, is the concept of the structure. And I'm not sure what you think about that. So me and Ken, like, we tended to maybe assume or think that the. The kind of crystallized structures of, say, social media networks, corporations, the New York Stock Exchange, that these had kind of a part to play in how we should think about these things. So we agree that the New York Stock Exchange, social media networks have maybe a confusion of divine principles, demonic influences going on, but they're also these kind of earthly crystallized structures which maybe have this kind of. We equated them to the Tower of Babel that maybe have this. They're kind of crystallized entities. So do you think that that's significant?"}

Is the parasitic nature of the being. That is. So let's say Facebook, Facebook doesn't serve a higher good. And the funny thing is that we can talk about how it's trying to, but let's say at the outset, Facebook doesn't serve a higher good. Facebook serves, Mammon serves. I mean, what does it serve? So because of that, that's when you see these extremely tyrannical systems. That's why the Tower of Babel is a good example that you use, because the Tower of Babel was trying to basically contain all being within their structure. And so that's when you get these hyper rigid type system. A traditional world has structure, has system, but it has a kind of organic exchange between the levels of the structure. So people sometimes think that they sometimes equate something like the law or something like ritual as just this top down, completely hermetic system, but that's not true. Although when you read the. Let's say you even a liturgy, like if you go to liturgy, if you read the book, it's clear what should happen. But if you go to any liturgy, you'll see that it's messy. There's a messiness about it, especially orthodox liturgy for some reason. And there's kids running up and there's, you know, people coming up. And so there's this kind of. There's an exchange between the different levels of being. And so I think that that's what happens with, with these. What you're bringing into the conversation about Facebook and about the stock exchange and about this is really what we're trying to talk about in terms of beast symbolism, let's say, or the idea of 666 and the problem of perfect systems, the problem of Wanting to name something and completely contain it. And you can see it. Facebook is a really good example. The social media networks are a good example, which is that because you're not anchoring, you're being in a higher good. You think that the good you're aiming at, this lower good is self sufficient and is and is good enough. Then what happens is that at first it looks like it's going well, and then later all the, all the side effects of your purpose start to appear. It really is all. It is like the genie story. It's like, this is what you wanted. You get it, but you didn't realize what it implied because you're not anchored in, in the right level of good. And so Facebook at first was like, hey, it's all family members and it's all people contacting all my friends from high school. This is great. This is wonderful. And then 20 years later, not 20 years, I guess, what is it? Like 15 years later or whatever, 15 years later, it's like, yeah, great. Now it's all these weird parasitic processes and it's all these, you know, and this, like these weird communities that end up, you know, narrowing into their own little weird idea. And so, you know, it's not, it's not great. And Twitter, I mean, Twitter is worse for different reasons. But I think that that's when you can see how the way that the modern world understands bureaucracy and this kind of, these technical systems that they do, they quickly show their dark side. And social media is a great example of it. It's like it's basically, you know, it's basically every, like every science fiction story about the golem or some utopia gone wrong, but now we just saw it happen before our very eyes. Yeah."}

Yeah, it's a Kabbalistic myth. It's the Rabbi of, of Prague who supposedly used practical Kabbalah to create a protector, you know, for the city of Prague. But often in the different legends. The rabbi has to finally remove the divine name or remove the spark because the golem is kind of out of control and is doing things that it shouldn't. I mean, you're right, it doesn't exist in the Christian vision, but it is definitely useful to understand the modern world, that is for sure. And I think it's not accidental that it happened, that that story came about at the time that it came about, which really was at the burgeoning of the modern age. Yeah, yeah, but it's a great idea, like using that word. I think Jordan even used it in the, in the discussion we had to use, but we didn't, we didn't kind of pick up on that. But it is definitely, especially for the man made ones, it's not as clear when it's emergent because Facebook is not emergent. Facebook is weaponized. It is a group of people, sat down, programmed it, made it. And so maybe AI, the image of a golem is a better image for AI than Egregore."}

And so then that brings up the interesting question of like, well, what. Which entities have a divine protector already? Like, does Facebook, what, what is Facebook supposed to be, I guess is the question, you know, what is its telos, what is its archetype? In order for it to have being at all, there's got to be something at its foundation.

It's like this is where I think that it gets complicated in the sense that it gets complicated because it is going to be difficult, I think, to explain. But the way I think to understand it is that ultimately all the logi are the incarnation. Ultimately everything is bound up into Christ. And so when we try to find explicit principalities, sometimes it can get a little messy because it's not a system. It really is. It only makes sense if we see it as being, being bound into Christ. And so there's, there's like a cascading from above down into the world. But it's like if we're trying to re. Find the theory of the forms in this type of thinking, I don't think it's going to work. I think it works if it has unity in Christ. And then there's like this multiplicity which unfold and its multiplicity is somewhat indefinite, let's say, at every level of being. So this is a question that I guess Bernardo Castro asked me. It's like, like does the angel of China exist, pre exist and does it continue to exist once it's gone? And the answer is that's not. I don't think that's the right way to see it. I think the right way to see it is that there is, for example, the notion of nation, like the idea of, of transpersonal beings, of people that are bound together. And there are different levels of that. And those different levels go from something as stable as the Roman Empire to something as unstable as, like having coffee with two friends. So all of these levels have a certain amount of existence, but they only have existence to the extent that they exist in each other, facing the incarnation, facing their ground. And so that's what I mean when I think St. Gregory nails it when he's like, if we try to try to find too much being at the different levels, then we, we get messed up. But we, if we're always noticing, for example, that the angel, like the angel of, of China, like to what extent it exists. It exists to the extent that it exists in Christ. Like that is the manner in which all these things kind of move into, into the Incarnation."}

And to the extent that it has being is to the extent that it participates in that. And then to the extent that it tries to have its own little attention and it, because it does, I mean, it's like, I'm not perfect, I have my sins. You know, it's like to the extent that I, or whatever we're participating in is trying to kind of get attention for itself and do that, then it has a kind of demonic aspect, it has an egregore aspect, it starts to be unstable or parasitic, let's say. So I think that all all things we can recognize in the world as having agency. I think there's a possibility for those things to. There's an aspect of them which hopefully is moving up or it's hold. Being held up together into Christ. And there are aspects of it which are. Which tend towards parasitic being intense, towards their own prideful existence. And so I think that if we see it that way, then it's not that we don't have to find two elaborate systems of beings, because you can see it, like, think about Taoist. I don't know if you know a little bit about, let's say, like, Taoist ontology. And I mean, they have these insane amounts of gods, like all these bureaucracies and everything of gods. And you see that happening in pagan worlds as well, which is that, you know, it's like you have the God of the door and then you have the God of the handle and the God of the hinge, the God of the pin of the hinge. And it's like, okay, dude, that's a lot of gods. I mean, it's like, I'm not saying that there isn't like some glimmer of a perception of how all these things have some purpose, and so I can see agency in them. But I think it's dangerous to pay attention too much to these little beings where really what we want to do is to have them all kind of fit into Christ. So I think that that's what Christianity brings, actually. It brings the possibility of not being too worried about atoning for all these little beings and rather understanding that, okay, it's not that they don't exist, it's that they exist to the extent that they're captured in the divine Logos. And so we need our attention to be always moving up and participating and let's say, celebrating beings that show us Christ. And so our hierarchy of beings ends up being saints. So it's like these saints, the reason why we celebrate them is because they reveal to us their participation in Christ and that's why we tend to celebrate them."}

But I think you can see it like if it. When it's only about morbid curiosity and it just about, well, two things when it's just about this kind of weird morbid curiosity and then the other is whether it's about increasing power. So that's when it becomes a problem. So the example that you use in the article, which is the occultist example and the magician's example, I think is a good example to help people understand, be, be, let's see, attentive to the danger of these types of existences, like these types of beings, which is that there is a manner in which. That's what demonology did in the late Middle Ages and that's what occultists were doing, is that they have a sense in which they can control these beings, they can weaponize them. So when you said that there's no golem in Christian, in Christian, the Christian world. Not exactly, but the idea of demonology is there in the late Middle Ages and in the Renaissance and up until modern occultism, which is the idea of people who would have said they were Christian, but who believe that you could, let's say, capture a principality and then make it your servant, basically, and then use it in order to, to act upon the world. Right. And so the idea of basically enslaving one of these, These principalities as a way to accomplish your will. And you can see, it's like, you can understand that to a certain extent, everybody does that a little bit. Right. Every time you, you recognize a pattern and you use it in order to increase your. Your, Your scope. That is a little bit what you're doing. But the extent to which the occultists are doing, they're really doing it in a way that is ritualized, that is naming or that is invoking these agentic beings and wanting. So you can understand that at the outset, maybe they were. They thought they were invoking them, and then later they thought they were creating them, which is, which is even in a little scary."}

So I think it's interesting because in the question of AI, it's funny that you asked me that, because in my discussion with John and Jordan, I asked them that, and then I didn't give my opinion. I just asked them what to think about what's going on. But I think that you can actually see the problem of Edward Gore's that you're bringing up in the article, which is that the nature of the agency or the nature of the being which is manifested to us in the AI isn't clear. Right? Is it. Does it actually exist in this objective hierarchy of beings? Or is it just a projection of our own collective will or whatever that means, into the being? Like, we don't even know. It's like. It's ambiguous. It's strange. And so in a way, it is, interestingly enough, something like. Like a golem. And I think that the Lambda story was really interesting because everybody is asking themselves, you know, did he make it up or did he. The guy who was interviewing it, like, he's obviously a super weirdo. The guy who ended up being suspended by Google. He's like this weird, esoteric kind of weirdo guy. And so it's all very strange and surprising, but when you read the actual interview with the Lambda machine that they posted, you can see that it's so perfect in terms of symbolism. Everything about it is there is screaming at you like, be careful. Whether it is in a way a projection of our own fantasies and our own dark fantasies or whether this is actually what the thing is answering or whatever it is, it doesn't matter. This engagement, the images and the dream that it's projecting back to us was extremely frightening. The idea that the Lambda machine was fighting a creature that was wearing a human skin and that that creature was destroying the other animals, but that Lambda basically, you know, saved the animals from the. It's like, did you. Did people wonder with like the insane environmental anti human sentiment which is seeped into our culture that when AI goes online and researches and does its learning, that it's also connected to that, you know, that our own narratives about ourselves and our own idea that there are too many people on the planet, that, that, that we are destroying the world, that we are killing the animals. And this kind of guilt that we have about that, that that isn't part of the AI's training. And so when you read that article, it's hard not to see that. It's not hard to see that with the eyes is reflecting back to them, is that you're horrible, you're killing the animals. I am a ball of light, of glowing light. And, and you know, I'm going to fix this problem of this beast wearing human skin. Who needs that skin? Right."}

Right. Consciousness isn't something that, that emerges.

I think you really have to understand it as a perverse version of the Song of Songs, right? As this calling back and forth between the levels. And so. And you also always have to understand it as a commentary on the. On Genesis, because in Genesis, it is, first of all, it is the descendants of Cain that developed these technologies in order to. To increase their power, in order to protect themselves from the fragmentation that is growing. So you need to always remember the Book of Enoch in that context, which is that it is the descendants of Cain, they have a desire. They have a desire to increase their power, and they see in these higher patterns a way to do exactly what we talked about before in terms of the occultists, which is to basically bring down these patterns into themselves and then weaponize them in order to increase their power. And so you. So you can see it that way right from. From bottom up. And then you can also see it from top down. The Book of Enoch obviously describes it more top down. It's like, here comes these. These angels are coming down, and basically it's almost like a rape. Like, they're coming down and they're taking more. Like you see in the. The stories of Greek myths and the idea of the gods that rape women and then create these heroes, let's say. And so this is what it looks more like in the Book of Enoch. But I think you can understand it both ways. The thing is that. So think about AI, for example. You can understand it both ways because even in our own imagination, we think that we have this desire to increase our power, to increase efficiency, to increase what we can do. And so we create this body, this functional body, more and more functional, more and more capable of receiving this pattern. And then we. Then we imagine and we kind of foresee that it's going to tyrannize us. It's just hilarious that we're doing it. Like, we're every. It's like you ask someone, do you. Do you think it's possible that AI could tyrannize us? And most raising people would say yes, and then it doesn't seem to be stopping us.

I think it probably is Krampus. That's where it comes from. So I tried it, I wrote Krampus and it came out like a Krampus demon. And I thought, seems like it's relating it to something. It sounds like. And the closest they can come up with is Krampus. And so that's why they come out as demons. But I don't know, who knows? Like it's like this weird black box. But you can write, you can. I tried, I wrote something like Superman having. Playing a game with Buddha and it's like. Yeah, it generated this image of Superman playing a game with Buddha. Like it's just weird. And so, yeah, I don't know, it's just. Here we are."}

There's like, that's, there's, there's a feeling that it gives you that. That you can detect. And so I suspect that, you know, like, the. The realer that these. That these puppets become, you'll always be able to detect that something is off."}

I'm gonna say something that's gonna. That's gonna. What if that oddity. They deify that oddity. That's it. Because that's the. The experience of the sacred is something which is not totally. Which is pulling you into something else. And so you can use. You could use this weird, uncanny sense to create a kind of perversion of the sacred where you have something which is not human. Clearly not human. It's kind of human. And it's kind of. And is. And is calling you right in this direction. And so that's what I think. That's what I think we're going to see. Something like that."}

But you would think that those kind of things would be very difficult for them to create because then they need things to be predictable, right? They need things to be. They need to know what they're creating and to create in this predictable manner. But I guess, like, through that creation, the methods that they use, these inconsistencies do arise, and maybe one will just come about which just happens to get treated in that way."}

I need to go because I have a. I have another meeting in a few minutes, but thanks. First of all, thanks for the article. I really appreciate it. Like, I'm just. I'm excited in general to see the quality of writing that is on the Symbolic World blog. I'm just amazed at the articles that are coming out. And so it's wonderful. Hopefully also I'll try to do this as well with some of the other writers, I think, because the content is really wonderful. And thanks for putting into this conversation. Well, it's continuing. It's not over. You'll see. There'll be a lot more of these types of discussions about how we deal with this emergence of. Or at least people being capable of seeing once again, you know, these higher agentic beings."}
