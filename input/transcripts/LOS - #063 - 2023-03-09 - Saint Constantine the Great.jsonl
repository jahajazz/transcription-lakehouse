And he will be the light of the nations and the hope of those whose hearts are troubled. All who dwell on the earth will fall down and worship him. And they will praise and bless and celebrate with song the Lord of Spirits. The modern world doesn't acknowledge, but is nevertheless haunted by spirits and angels, demons and saints. In our time, many yearn to break free of the prison of a flat secular materialism, to see and to know reality as it truly is. What is this spiritual reality like? How do we engage with it? Well, how do we permeate everyday life with spiritual presence? Orthodox Christian priests Father Andrew Stephen Damick and Fr. Stephen DeYoung host this live call in show focused on enchantment in creation, the union of the seen and unseen as made by God and experienced by mankind throughout history. Welcome to the Lord of Spirits."}

You know that if you're listening to us live, you can call in at 855-AF-RADIO. That's 855-237-2346 and Matuska Trudy should be taking your calls and we will get to them in the second part of our show. Lord of Spirits is brought to you by our listeners and also by Chrysostom Academy. A lot of you listeners out there work from home. We know that if you're telecommuting you could probably live almost anywhere you like. If you're a parent of school age kids and you're like me working from a virtual office, then one of your big considerations for where you live is where your kids go to school. I love living in Lehigh Valley of Pennsylvania. Part of why is because my kids go to Chrysostom Academy and it's a pan orthodox classical school with elementary through high school students. It is on a beautiful 55 acre wooded campus with a creek running next to it, has the highest academic standards and it is focused not just on educating the mind, but forming the whole person in Christ. So if you don't live here yet, think about moving to the Lehigh Valley and sending your kids to Chrysostom Academy. And even if you don't telecommute, our local Economy is growing and it's producing jobs. So maybe one of those could be for you. We've got eight Orthodox parishes in our metro area. You can visit chrysostomacademy.org to see what I'm talking about."}

They could do a lot of things right, so. Orthodox Christians around the world were collectively puzzled when it was announced on social media recently that King Charles III of the United kingdom and France, 14 other Commonwealth realms, what was at his upcoming coronation going to be anointed with Chrism that had been blessed by the Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem and also the Anglican archbishop in the same city. In between the hubbub and guessing games over whether what happened was some kind of Khan celebration, some might have been startled to discover that the word chrism turns out to be usable for any kind of anointing oil, not just the kind used at baptism. Does this mean that Charles is going to be anointed the Byzantine emperor? Yes, we will leave that. We will leave that to the excitable to debate. Right after Father Stephen just gives away the answer."}

So technically, Charles is also a descendant of the Greek royal family on his father's side. Because otherwise no one's going to listen to what we say. They're just going to be vexed by the Pan heresy of ecumenism and won't be able to take in the knowledge that we're about to drop. So also, I wanted to note, because I know our last episode was a little bit brain breaking, that once we are done with our sacrament series, which, I mean, that could be a while, Right. We're at eight and counting. But once we eventually are done with the sacrament series, we are going to return to this topic of the soul."}

That's the teaser. Oh, man, I'm going to drop out there. But so now back to Back to Kings, back to tonight's topic, which we'll invariably get to in the third half or near there too. We talked a little bit about the anointing of kings in the episode in which we talked about the concept of the Messiah, which we. I'm sure we had a clever title to, but I don't remember it."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #063 - 2023-03-09 - Saint Constantine the Great","start":501.23,"end":505.31,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Yes, because that's what Messiah means. It means an anointed one."}

And so within that, we talked about anointed kings. But so tonight's episode where we're talking about one of the sacraments, one of the holy mysteries, the Orthodox Church, which is the consecration of the emperor, that's where this is going. We need to start by sort of revisiting obviously the, the rite of the consecration of the emperor has its beginnings in the consecration of kings and in kingship itself, right. Which begins the Old Testament. And so if you're following your generic Lord of Spirits episode planner, we're starting at Genesis one."}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #063 - 2023-03-09 - Saint Constantine the Great","start":562.23,"end":565.75,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Technically we're starting in Genesis 2, verses 1 and 2. Really?"}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #063 - 2023-03-09 - Saint Constantine the Great","start":565.75,"end":568.47,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"That's true. Because this is Sabbath stuff."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #063 - 2023-03-09 - Saint Constantine the Great","start":568.95,"end":967.65,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Sabbath stuff, right. And so we've talked about this before on the show that, and this is potentially ruining Sunday school, that, you know, the way we tend to think of, you know, on the seventh day, the Lord completed his work and he rested. We tend to think of that in terms of like, wow, that was tough, making a whole universe in six days. So now I'm going to take a break. And of course that's not what's going on, right? God did not need a break. But when it refers to God resting, that is him resting, meaning being seated upon the divine throne, right, to preside over now his creation, which he has completed creating. And so this theme of kingship of God is the king over creation starts right there at the get go. And so we talked, we've talked about before how the Sabbath then, the weekly Sabbath, the Sabbath year, right? But the Sabbaths that were commanded in the Torah were for Israel to participate not in God taking a break, but to participate in the kingdom, right? To, to participate in God's reign. That's why it was at the end of the week, right? Because it was pointing forward, right, to, to the coming of God's kingdom on earth as it is in heaven, right? So that that kingship is established there. And the way in which the, the Torah itself and several significant portions of the Torah function are. And I know we've talked about this before on the show, but we need to come back at it again from this angle is as Covenant documents, right? We talked about the, the Hebrew word is berit, the Greek word is diatheke, that often gets translated in English now as testament rather than as covenant. And so a lot of folks have a bifurcation in their brain where when you say Old Testament, New Testament, they think about divisions of the Bible like part one and part two of the Bible when really that means old covenant, new covenant, Right? Those are the same terms, right. And so the Old Covenant, the original covenant, Right. Is a covenant document. And not just in general, but of a particular type. When we hear covenant, we tend to think of like, oh, well, it's like a contract, it's like an agreement, right? If we hear the word testament, we think like, oh, last will and testament. It's like a legal document. But the actual pattern in that we see in the Torah and in significant sections of it is patterned after a particular type of sort of treaty document from the ancient Near East. And we found a bunch of examples that match up really closely in Hittite documents. A lot of these are written in Luvian, but they're Hittite documents. They're what are called suzerainty treaties or suzerain vassal treaties. They are a type of treaty document that was issued by a king to his vassals. So this king is someone lesser, right? So this king has now taken control of a number of cities. He's like the great king. Those cities have their own rulers. But now since he's in charge, he can now give his terms to those rulers who are now under his authority. And the particular pattern, in broad strokes, we won't go too deeply into this right now, tonight, but in broad strokes, the pattern is that those begin with an identification of the king, of the great king, and a sort of historical recounting of who he is and what he's done, and particularly what he's done on behalf of the vassal. Then it outlines the vassals responsibilities, his duties, right to the great king. And then at the end, there is a section of, here are all the good things that will happen if you do what you're supposed to do. And then here are all the bad things that will happen if you don't do what you're supposed to do. And one of the really obvious places where you can see this pattern within the Torah is in the Ten Commandments, what we now call the Ten Commandments, which are in Exodus 20 and then again in Deuteronomy 5. And those begin with right, I am Yahweh, your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery, right? So here's who I am. Here is what I have done for you. Now here are your responsibilities. You have no other gods before me, you will not make a graven image, etc. Etc. Right? It's less obvious in the Ten Commandments, right? The blessings and curses, though there are a few listed in there, right? That you honor your father and mother so that your days may be long in the land that Yahweh or God is giving you. Right. So there are some contained. But if you want to see sort of a very full example of this pattern, the entire book of Deuteronomy follows this pattern. The book of Deuteronomy begins with a historical sort of prologue. In the middle it has commandments, and then it ends chapters 28 through 30 with a series of blessings if those are kept and curses if they are not."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #063 - 2023-03-09 - Saint Constantine the Great","start":968.21,"end":972.13,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Yeah, which we talk about that in some detail in the blessings and curses episode."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #063 - 2023-03-09 - Saint Constantine the Great","start":972.21,"end":1018.27,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Yeah, so, but so this is the pattern. And so the very pattern within which God first reveals himself to Israel here in the Torah is following this pattern of presenting him as the great King. Now, that said, that said, we are. So most of the folks who listen to this show, there are a lot who don't, but the majority, the simple majority, are in the United States. Another big chunk are in the UK and Commonwealth countries. You know, the show's in English, so that will tend to happen."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #063 - 2023-03-09 - Saint Constantine the Great","start":1019.23,"end":1020.75,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"And we have a chunk of Australians."}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #063 - 2023-03-09 - Saint Constantine the Great","start":1024.31,"end":1050.97,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Probably a Commonwealth country. Yeah. Right. And so in all of these places, the popular Christianity, as it were, is either Puritan or heavily influenced by Puritanism. And Puritanism is not overly fond of kings. America is of course, worse about this than the other places I mentioned."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #063 - 2023-03-09 - Saint Constantine the Great","start":1051.93,"end":1055.45,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"It's kind of our, our whole founding deal here in America."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #063 - 2023-03-09 - Saint Constantine the Great","start":1055.45,"end":1142.2,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Yeah, we're not quite as bad as the French, but it's kind of our raison debt. Yeah. And so that has colored the way a lot of us have been taught the Old Testament, where it is very much presented as if before a few chapters into the book of Samuel, Israel was sort of ruled directly by God as king, and that's how things should have stayed. But man, those no good Israelites, they demanded a king from God and that was bad. And he gave him one. And then David shows up and is really good at it. I don't know how that works into the narrative, but that's very clearly not true if we read carefully. Right. Because as we just mentioned, the whole book of Deuteronomy is patterned in the form of this treaty from the great king. Right. The references I'm making here are deliberate. Let the listener understand. But Deuteronomy contains within it Deuteronomy 17, 14, 20, which are explicitly commandments aimed at the human king who is going to reign over Israel, which there isn't."}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #063 - 2023-03-09 - Saint Constantine the Great","start":1154.42,"end":1200.62,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"The idea that there will be one particular vassal that only are all of the Israelites or the Israelite elders or the prophet or a judge are vassals who are receiving the Torah. But that there is going to be one particular vassal king who is going to have particular responsibilities above and beyond the responsibilities given to other Israelites is right here in the middle of. Right. The statement of the Old Covenant. Right. So that, of course, raises the question of what is going on then in like 1 Samuel or First Kingdoms 8."}

The problem is that they wanted a king like the other nations. And specifically, yeah, I was gonna say."}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #063 - 2023-03-09 - Saint Constantine the Great","start":1231.43,"end":1261.84,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Right. So they had just suffered this defeat where they said, hey, we're gonna go into battle just of their own decision, and we're gonna take the Ark of the Covenant out in front of us and then we'll win because we have the Ark of the Covenant, so God will make us win. Right. And of course, that didn't work out so good for them, and they lost the ark and everything. But rather than getting the message that they were supposed to get from that, the message they got was, well, I guess we can't count on God to help. Right?"}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #063 - 2023-03-09 - Saint Constantine the Great","start":1262.32,"end":1274.52,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Yeah.

I'm going to go into business for myself, and then when it doesn't work out, I'm going to blame God. Right, that's so. And so this is what's going on there. And this is why God says to Samuel, right, they haven't rejected you, they've rejected me. Right. This is the problem there. Not that they were going to have a king, Right. In general, but so that passage In Deuteronomy, Deuteronomy 17, 14, 20, sort of lays out Right. Here are the particular commandments directed at the king. This is who the king over Israel is supposed to be and what he's supposed to do and not do. Yep."}

It's not one verse, it's a few verses. So listen closely, everybody. Starting with verse 14. When you come to the land that the Lord your God is giving you, and you possess it and dwell in it, and then say, I will set a king over me, like all the nations that are around me, you may indeed set a king over you, whom the Lord your God will choose one from among your brothers you shall set as king over you. You may not put a foreigner over you who is not your brother. Only he must not acquire many horses for himself or cause the people to return to Egypt in order to acquire many horses, since the Lord has said to you, you shall never return that way again. And he shall not acquire many wives for himself, lest his heart turn away, nor shall he acquire for himself excessive silver and gold. And when he sits on the throne of his kingdom, he shall write for himself in a book a copy of this law approved by the Levitical priests, and it shall be with him, and he shall read it in all the days of his life. That he may learn to fear the Lord his God by keeping all the words of this law and these statutes and doing them.

That's why there was so much intermarriage, shall we say, within the royal families in all of these city states and in Egypt, because you couldn't marry a commoner because they were just humans. And so this is a dramatic departure from that. Right. So the king is not sort of another class of being. He is not a higher being. It's not like the Sumerian kings list where the kingship comes down from heaven."}

The other Israelites are his brothers. He is just sort of the eldest brother. And so a lot of people will say that St. Paul. Right. One of the issues people have with St. Paul is that when you read the Gospels, especially the Synoptic Gospels, Christ is constantly talking about the kingdom. There's all this kingdom language, king language. And then people will say, well, St. Paul doesn't use that language. Right. And while you can make that case, if you're just going by Greek words, conceptually, when St. Paul is using the language of Christ as firstborn among many brethren of Christ as the son of God and our adoption as sons and heirs of God. Right. This is appealing to the way in which covenantal inheritance was understood. The eldest brother inherits everything and then distributes it Right. To the other heirs. And so in the same sense, the king is functioning as this elder brother. He has these particular responsibilities before God. He is sort of the vassal of vassals. Right. But he is an intermediary figure in the sense of having an added set of responsibilities both toward God and toward his brothers, not as being a special class of human or more than human. Right. So after Deuteronomy, you get Joshua, where Joshua sort of carries on Moses role, which is a sort of kingly role in the sense that Joshua is the one leading into battle. Joshua is the one, as Moses had, who is in charge of the various judges and elders of the people and that kind of thing. But then you get into the Book of Judges proper, and there is this refrain over and over again that in that day there was no king and everyone did what was right in their own eyes."}

Sorry, anarchists in Judges, at least that's not a good thing. Right. That's. That's. Everything's a mess. Right. And how is that working within the Book of Judges? Well, we've talked before a lot about what justice is biblically. So justice mishpat Right. Is when everything is in its proper place, everything is related properly to everything else, and everything is functioning peacefully and appropriately and in good order."}

And so since we don't have someone doing that, we don't have a person who's sort of maintaining justice, establishing the state of justice and then maintaining it. You get this series and Judges of escalating cycles where Israel, or in judges, usually some part thereof, some tribe or tribes within Israel fall into disobedience and then come because of they fallen into disobedience. God removes his protection from them and they get conquered by some outside force, Midianites, Philistines, whomever, Moabites. And then God raises up a judge who doesn't hear any cases. Right. The judge's job is to judge, meaning to reestablish justice. He comes in, overthrows the oppressors, and then the cycle repeats."}

Right. Because there is no one to sort of establish and maintain an appropriate status quo of holiness and justice and peace. And the Book of Judges is using that as the argument for this is why we need to have a king to be that person who does that, to be the one who establishes divine justice and then maintains it in the face of sin and injustice within Israel. Because I mean, God was doing that in the Book of Judges. Right, but to disastrous consequence."}

Right. And repent, rather than things getting so horrible that Israel gets conquered. Right. There is a maintenance of justice within the kingdom. And so the king is not sort of doing this independently. It's not that, oh well, once they get a human king, he does that, so then God doesn't have to. It's that the king is functioning as an icon of God, as the great king and his court is sort of functioning as an icon of the divine council. God shares his rule over his creation with first the angelic beings and then later humanity. And the same way the king, obviously his rule is administered by these people. Right. And this is an icon then of God and his government of the creation. And that sense of icon or image works in both directions. Meaning on one hand, the king and the other members of his government have a Responsibility to image God in what they're doing. So it's God's justice that they're enforcing, not their own whims, not their own preferences, not their own power, not their own authority. Right. But God's."}

Is a, again, a deliberate and drastic departure from what's going on in the other nations or in the nations where the pagan kings are not icons of the gods, they're idols in the sense that the king himself is one of the bodies of the God.

And so technically, the anointed king, David is the Messiah in that sense, he's the anointed king. Right. And so we also understand, especially the Davidic kingship. And this was very clearly understood before Jesus of Nazareth was born right on this earth. It was very clearly understood that David was the icon, the image of the Messiah who was going to come. Right. We see people in the Gospels again, especially the Synoptic gospels, who cry out to Jesus for healing. And as an expression of their faith, they call him the son of David. Right. That's calling him the Messiah. They understood David is sort of this image, this icon of the Messiah who's going to come. And so then there's going to be this natural transition in understanding afterwards. We're not jumping there quite yet, but after the coming of Christ that kings post the advent of Christ are understood as icons of Christ. Right. Looking back, but we'll get into that more as we move forward. So a couple more notes sort of on, on Old Testament kingship. One important thing, and we talked about this quite a bit in the Melchizedek episode, is that of course, priest and king are divided in the old covenant."}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #063 - 2023-03-09 - Saint Constantine the Great","start":2728.11,"end":2845.37,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"In Christ in a certain way. We'll, we'll talk a little more about that later too. And of course, with this role, as we already saw a little bit in Deuteronomy 17, with this role as the king, as the oldest brother, as the icon of the kingship of God, the icon of Christ on earth also meant that the king is held to a higher standard and to a higher judgment, faces a greater judgment. This is a basic principle all through the scriptures, including in, in the New Testament. Think about Christ saying from him who has been given much, much will be required. Everything St. Paul says about. Not many of you should presume to be teachers. Right. This is especially true, of course, of. Of the kings. And what we see when we look at the way the prophets come, both in what are sometimes called genre wise, the historical books, the former prophets, when the prophets come to confront kings there, and also within the latter prophets, the prophets proper, when they're talking about the kings and leaders and rulers of Israel and even other countries, other nations. The basis of judgment is basically what is laid out in Psalm 82 or 81 in the Greek, which is the basis on which, as we've talked about that psalm before, the. The gods of the nations are judged, the spirits."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #063 - 2023-03-09 - Saint Constantine the Great","start":2845.85,"end":2894.84,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Yeah. I mean, like the first verse of Psalm 82, of course, it says that God stands up in the divine council and renders judgment. Right. And then it says what the basis of the judgment is. Like, this is kind of like reading out the charges against them. And also like, this is what you should have done. Right. So here's what it is. Starting with verse 2. How long will you judge unjustly and show partiality to the wicked? Give justice to the weak and the fatherless, Maintain the right of the afflicted and the destitute, rescue the weak and the needy, deliver them from the hand of the wicked? So the idea, of course, is that these fallen gods, these fallen angels, have not been doing what he told them to do, but instead have been judging unjustly and giving partiality. You know, they've been favoring the wicked."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #063 - 2023-03-09 - Saint Constantine the Great","start":2896.61,"end":2962.52,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Right, right. And not protecting the people. Yes. And so the role that was assigned to these angelic beings at Babel, at the dividing of the nations, was to shepherd them in general and in particular to shepherd them back to God. Right. Saint Dionysus the Areopagite, talks about this too, as we've mentioned before, and they fail to do it. But this pattern, this is the same thing the prophets condemned the kings for. And so we see that the kingship has this kind of angelic ministry to it, meaning it is also the job of any given king, Israel's king especially. Right. But also the kings of the other nations to shepherd those people and to shepherd them ultimately back to God."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #063 - 2023-03-09 - Saint Constantine the Great","start":2963.8,"end":2966.52,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Yeah. So it's a salvific role."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #063 - 2023-03-09 - Saint Constantine the Great","start":2967.4,"end":3030.04,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Right. And that's why we see this pattern when it talks about the saints in heaven who experienced the first resurrection in Revelation, or when it talks about the saints in the new heavens and the new earth. This language is Used of reigning, ruling and reigning right of being enthroned with Christ being part of the divine council that is paralleled with angelic ministry. Right. But you also have this ruling, reigning kingship government language. Right. And those two things bleed into each other. So the, the, the king ultimately, ultimately, to sum this up, what you ultimately get at with the king's responsibility, starting with learning and studying the Torah and keeping it fully in, in serving as the image of God on earth to establish justice."}

Right? That's the ultimate command. That's, that's given to the king. And this is part of why Christ then is the ultimate king because he is in his person, the perfect bringing together of our human nature and God and the divine nature are united in his person. And so he is the ultimate king by perfectly fulfilling that. Right. So yes, the king was particularly, particularly called to that. And this is why you see in the language regarding saints in the new covenant in the New Testament, again, you know, St. Paul saying, do you not know that we will judge angels? This connection to the, the, that the, those of the church are a royal priesthood, right? This connection of kingship already kingship within the kingdom with Christ as the king and us as vassals, this is also deeply connected to the theosis language of our salvation."}

But like the whole, the whole argument that he makes is it's couched within language about adoption. You know, that, that, that's, that's where this comes from. It's not some floating doctrine about, you know, experiencing the Holy Spirit. It's within the context of adoption as sons of God."}

And so as I mentioned, this isn't just a question of Israel's king. This is every king, right? Every king. The kings of the nations, the corrupt ones, the evilest ones, right. All had power and authority given to them by God. He was the source of any power and authority they had and therefore were responsible, had this higher level of responsibility."}

Right. He says that to Pontius Pilate. Right. When he's standing in front of him. John 19:11. Jesus answered him, that is Pilate. You would have no authority over me at all unless it had been given you from above. Therefore he who delivered me over to you has the greater sin. In other words, that all power is derivative. But, you know, ultimately, where does all that power come from? It comes from God. God permits even the bad kings to be the king."}

But when the Western Roman Empire collapses. Right. When that collapse happens in Western Europe and new social structures have to be built, it's very natural, it was very natural for the Christians there to return to this tradition and to bring back anointed kingship as the form of government based on this pattern within. Within the Scriptures. Right. How should we organize ourselves? Well, you know, spoilers. You're not going to get democracy out of the Old Testament or even really."}

Although you probably didn't. Well, it depends on."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #063 - 2023-03-09 - Saint Constantine the Great","start":3349.45,"end":3350.13,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Someone did."}

It wasn't the average guy, you know, it wasn't. It wasn't the average elf out in the fields. Yeah. No, it would be the nobles. Often the lower nobles included the bishops, the abbots, the dukes, the earls, the thanes. They get to vote for the king. It's not primogeniture in Anglo Saxon England. And the reason why I point that out, so they have a big meeting called the Witan Yamut. So the Witan is all sort of the wide."}

I mean, it would sometimes be the son of the previous king, but not required. But the reason why I point all that out is because at the ceremony where he becomes king, the king has to swear a bunch of oaths that are considered to bind him to the people and require him to do certain things. And so it's, it's a Christian notion of kingship. It's different from the kind of kingship of just might that is the pagan style. Right. There's this sense of responsibility to the people. And of course, the fact that he gets elected, there's that sense of responsibility too. Again, as they say about feudalism, in democracy, theoretically it's your vote that counts, but in feudalism, it's your count that votes. So that's kind of true in Anglo Saxon England. But yeah, this idea that the king is responsible, he's not just the biggest guy who can do whatever the heck he wants. All right, well, that said, let's go to our first break and we'll be right back with the second half of the Lord of Spirits."}

So we spent the first part talking about kingship in the Bible, and now we're going to start talking about kingship as we start to move through history, particularly Rome, because, you know, that's one of the big questions, not the only question in orthodox church history, but it's certainly one of the big questions about how community is organized within Christian history.

We have to talk a little bit about the whole concept of the Roman Emperor. Right. And the Roman Empire as such. Right. So Rome, not built in a day, as it turns out, took a long time. Yeah. And so Rome in particular was not a big fan of the idea of kings. The earliest early kings of Rome, in their own understanding of their history, were referred to as the tyrants. That's where we get the word the tyrannis. And so those were the battle days."}

You don't need any more street cred with that faction. Okay. He's not a tyranny. So Rome then forms a republic centered around the Senate. And the Senate was sort of deliberately constructed in order to have a distribution of power. So that power would never sort of overly conglomerate in any one person. Right. So you have different roles, like the console, like you have these different roles, but there's always two, three. A lot of times these are chosen by lot. There are different methods at different periods of Roman history by which even when you have to have somebody who's kind of in charge, you make it a couple people and you pit them against each other in various ways. Right. To sort of make sure nothing gets out of hand. And this, of course, if you're familiar with American history or you've ever been to Washington, D.C. and looked around, you know that the. The Roman Republic and the functioning of the Roman Senate was sort of the deliberate basis of the American system of government. Right. They were the same way.

He's sort of pitted against Pompey. Right. As the other great general. Pompey's out annexing things in the East. Caesar's out dividing Gaul in three parts. Right. And we try to. To. To.

He succeeds where Julius failed. And now we have a Roman Empire. The Senate sticks around. There is still a Roman Senate, but for most of the history of the Roman Empire, they're not doing a whole lot right. Yeah. They're mostly. It eventually devolves into rich people with titles. Right.

Even with this being the case, even with Augustus now having basically total power and the people following after him in the Julio Claudian dynasty, and then afterwards wielding pretty close to ultimate power later on, much later in the history of the empire, as we're going to talk about here in a minute, they fall back into old patterns of sort of dividing up authority again, having an emperor in the west and one in the east, and Augustus and. Right. Trying to pitting them against each other on purpose. Right. But even. Even when Augustus is fully feeling his oats, even when he's having Aeschylus, like, rewrite the history of the empire to focus on him as the coming to fruition of all of Roman history, he's not able to take the title king for himself.

So the title becomes Imperator, which is where we get Emperor and Empire ultimately, too. Yes, yeah, yeah. Which goes from Imperium. Right. But the. The Imperator before Caesar is a military title that was awarded as an honorary title after a general had won a great victory in war. So imperator literally means like commander. The one who commands are the one who orders, the one who puts an order, like musters an army. Right. But because of the context in which it was granted, that was granted after achieving these great victories, it came to have sort of the connotation of conqueror. Right. Like the victorious general. Right. And so if Imperator is sort of the conqueror, the orderer, then the Imperium is the conquered or ordered area. Right. The region that's under his. His command, under his orders. Right. Under his law giving. And so the empire grows. There's a number of administrative issues, really. There was always an Eastern and Western Roman Empire. Right. As we just mentioned, Caesar was in the west and Pompey was in the East. Right. There were always. There were cultural differences with. With the way Greek was used, although Greek was used even in the Western Roman Empire for a good while, and other cultural differences. But it becomes sort of formal, administratively formal, later on, as we mentioned, you get an emperor, you get an Augustus in each half. You have sort of these four figures who have different powers. Again, trying to break things up. But now the aforementioned St. Constantine arrives, and not a saint yet, and inherits the title of Augustus in the west while he's in Britain from his father. When his father dies and decides that he is going to roll things back and he's going to become the emperor. Emperor. He's going to become the single emperor, the monarch of the Roman Empire. And so now we're going to talk about St. Constantine and we're going to be doing now a lot of myth busting."}

That's the other claimants Right. To the imperial throne. And so he has. Now, there are different accounts of this. So Eusebius of Caesarea, who's the Eusebius who wrote the Ecclesiastical history, was like the biggest simp for St. Constantine in the history of Earth, really. It's depressing, right. It's like, pull yourself together, man. When you read some of the stuff he writes about, about St. Constantine and I'm someone who calls him St. Constantine and I feel this way reading Eusebius.

So I look for Eusebius, Lactantius crossover when it comes to. To St. Constantine, and both of them record him. So with Eusebius, there's multiple visions and different things happening, but both of them have him. Before the battle of Bilvia Bridge, he has this dream in which Christ appears to him and tells him to put a particular sign on the shields of his men to protect them in battle. And so Eusebius. It's kind of vague as to exactly what this is. Right. It's just sort of the sign of the cross."}

But Lactantius describes it in some more Detail as the key row symbol. Right, Key. The key and row being the Greek letters. Right. The key looking kind of like an X in English. And the capital row looking is the thing that looks kind of like a shepherd's crook. Like it's hooked over at the top and they're superimposed over each other. You've probably seen this symbol. Yeah, You've probably seen this symbol in the Orthodox Church and. Or the Roman Catholic Church still uses it. Not with the keys and everything. Sorry, Vatican, but. But just the. The symbol of the key in the row, which, of course, are the first two letters in Christos and which also forms a cross shape. And so this. Saint Constantine did this. Saint Constantine won the battle. Saint Constantine became emperor after the battle because of this. He issued the Edict of Milan, the Edict of toleration that legalized Christianity. But all other religions, too. Right. To be fair, granted, broad legal toleration. But it wasn't just like, okay, we're not going to persecute you anymore. Because within the Roman Empire, persecution was always sort of localized at different times in different periods. Right. It wasn't just perpetually we're killing all the Christians we find for 300 years."}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #063 - 2023-03-09 - Saint Constantine the Great","start":4770.34,"end":4860.37,"speaker":"Robbie","text":"Yeah, thank you. So, first of all, I'm A big fan of the show. Thank you for everything that you guys do. But, yeah, my question is about kind of this idea of coronation as a sacrament. I know you guys are going to talk a lot more about this, so maybe I'm jumping the gun, but I specifically wanted to ask. There seems to be this conflict. I don't know if it's a conflict or a development, a change or something, where early on it looks like the patriarch is crowning the emperor and. Or later like the king and the king of Yugoslavia or something. But then later it seems as though, like the. The tsar and I don't know, maybe some emperors you would know better, kind of purposefully crown themselves seemingly as a symbol of their authority comes directly from God and not through the Church. At least that's what I've read from people who talk about this. So I don't know that that's kind of one of the parts that kind of doesn't sit well with me. It seems like if it's a sacrament, it should be like a sacrament that comes from the church and everything, and why the flip flop? So I don't know if you guys know anything about that, but that's always been a great curiosity to me, ever since I started looking into this stuff."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #063 - 2023-03-09 - Saint Constantine the Great","start":4861.25,"end":4886.87,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Yeah, well, so. So actually, at the end of this half, we're going to take people on a little walk through a particular coronation ceremony for an empress. So hang on to that, that'll be fun. And it's one of the later Byzantine emperors, but. But I am. I can't name any names off the top of my head, so maybe, you know, Father Stephen. But I. I have remember reading about some European kings that do crown themselves. You know, there's a sense of."}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #063 - 2023-03-09 - Saint Constantine the Great","start":4888.87,"end":4923.48,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Know, that there's this. This sense that, as you said, you know. Well, that's mine. I'm the person with the power here anyway, so, you know, gimme. But I would say, though, that in general, the standard is that, you know, the king is crowned by whoever the chief bishop in his realm is. That's what typically occurs, certainly. I'm sure that's what we're going to see, you know, not too long with King Charles iii, is that the Archbishop of Canterbury is going to put the crown on his head, you know, that it's not something he does for himself. I don't know. Father Stephen, do you know of any Christian kings that are crowning themselves?"}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #063 - 2023-03-09 - Saint Constantine the Great","start":4924.6,"end":4966.56,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Yeah, well, so there's, of course, I mean, famously, there's the Charlemagne argument about whether he crowned himself or not. Yeah, I knew that was a little fuzzy, but, but, but also. So in terms of, of Robbie's direct question, a lot of people now, I mean, this was. Everybody Learned about this 20 years ago when I was coming into the church, but apparently nobody does now, or at least I have reason to believe that a lot of people haven't about what happened from the 16th century on with the Russian church. That. Right. I mean, Peter the Great gets rid of the patriarch."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #063 - 2023-03-09 - Saint Constantine the Great","start":4966.72,"end":4968.96,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Yeah, there's no Patriarch, there's just the Holy Synod."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #063 - 2023-03-09 - Saint Constantine the Great","start":4969.28,"end":5236.17,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Right. And he does that deliberately to pattern the government of the Russian Orthodox Church after the government of the Lutheran churches in Germany. And then in later periods they bring in Jesuits to teach at all the seminaries. Right. So there's this period of time where the Russian Church gets subjected to the Russian state. Those tsars are not super pious people in the sense of Orthodox piety, at least. Right. And so a lot of the traditional practices of the Orthodox Church get subjugated to the whim of the emperor or empress, if we're talking about Catherine. Right. And so lots of things happen like that because the church did not have the power. Well, obviously you can't have the czar getting crowned by the patriarch if there isn't one. And so lots of things like that happen. Lots of things even by people who are saints. They're saints because of how they live their lives. Right. But you have texts coming out of Russian seminaries and Russian church officials at that time where you find Lutheranism or Roman Catholic, Jesuit theology, or at least terminology all over the place. Right. And it's not that they were heretics, it's not that they weren't really Orthodox, they were. It's just the time they grew up in the education they received. That's the terminology they learned. And so in their lives, they're clearly practicing the Orthodox faith in a true way. Right. Or at least the truest way they could, given the material realities of the time and place that they lived. And that's why they're saints. But a lot of the outer forms in that get subjugated to the whims of some very not holy people in the Russian civil government, which really, the further you go into the modern age is deliberately trying to compete with and pattern itself after the modern governments of Western Europe. That's sort of an inferiority complex. And so, yeah, a lot of things like that unfortunately happen. I mean, we're in part eight of our Sacrament series. But if you go to a lot of the theological manuals that are published during that period when the Jesuits are teaching in all the Russian seminaries, they'll say there's seven sacraments and they give the Roman Catholic list. Yeah, Right. Whereas if you look at older stuff or. Or Orthodox stuff that's coming from places not affected by the Russian crown and what it's doing, you'll see longer lists. You'll see lists of 10, lists of 12. But. So, yeah, I would chalk up those incidents with the czar to that same kind of foreign spirit from Europe making intrusions into the. The civil government of Russia. And that isn't, to me, any kind of argument against the Orthodox faith because, I mean, there are iconoclast emperors within the Byzantine Empire. At least one of the emperors was a monothellite. There's emperors with all kinds of different sympathies all through. You know, and the iconoclast emperors were killing people and torturing people for having icons, you know, so there's no guarantee that any given emperor will be a saint, that he will respect the church and subject himself to the church any more than there was any guarantee that the king of Israel would actually read the Torah and try to practice the commandments. Right. So, yeah, yeah, you're right that those things happened. And I think that spirit, that modern spirit from Western Europe that infected the government of Russia for centuries is responsible for it."}

So the part of the problem. Part of the problem is the kind of ludicrous level of presentism that's presupposed when this topic is even addressed by contemporary people, including scholars. So the question, as it is commonly asked in the present day, did Constantine convert to Christianity? Is understanding conversion to Christianity as a combination of some kind of emotional experience or feeling with him, changing his ideas or beliefs about certain things."}

All of the main arguments that are made by people, not all, most. We'll get to the other one in a little bit. The main arguments that are made for why, when. When somebody's going to say he didn't really become Christian are all examples of where he tolerated Roman paganism."}

He doesn't burn down all the pagan temples. He doesn't, you know, require all the senators to convert to Christianity. He doesn't immediately say, no more coins with pagan symbols on them. We're going to print Jesus on all the coins now or something. Right. So he doesn't do those things. Right. And therefore he didn't really become a Christian. The presupposition there, of course, is that Christianity is completely intolerant. The presupposition there is that if he was really a Christian, he would have immediately gone on a witch hunt."}

Because there aren't a bunch of Christians around in the third century, even at the depths, the bitterest depths of persecution, who are writing things, talking about how, oh, we need to get revenge. One of these days we're going to get power and we're going to go and kill all these pagans the way they killed us and torture them the way they tortured us. There aren't any Christians writing those things because that's not how Christianity works. Right. We have a rich theology of martyrdom that was taken over from the Jewish concept of martyrdom in the Second Temple period. Okay. We're not looking for. We're not. We're never looking for revenge. So why would you expect Constantine to do that if he became a Christian? Right. That's just a prejudice that A given person has against Christianity and a caricature of Christians that they have. And since Constantine doesn't turn into that after his conversion. Oh, he must not have really converted."}

Colossally stupid argument or set of arguments. Right. But so if we look at the only thing we have access to what St. Constantine did after his conversion, and as we already mentioned, we have unparalleled access to all the things he did, it paints a very different picture of change right off the bat. Right off the bat. St. Constantine establishes himself as the sole emperor of Rome. He is now imperator. He makes, he assembles a Roman triumph, right.

The Emperor marches into Rome, proceeds to the temple of Jupiter on Palatine Hill and there as the Pontifex Maximus offers sacrifices to Jupiter in thanks for his victory and his enthronement, St. Constantine marches into the city and goes directly to his palace. Right. Does not pass Jupiter Temple, does not collect 200 dead goats or whatever. My analogy is breaking down. He goes directly to his residents did not offer the pagan sacrifices. Now our folks who want to say, I mean that in itself is, is, is a huge piece of evidence that the conversion was real. Right. The fact that he breaks with centuries of tradition by not giving thanks to Jupiter for his victory and instead giving credit to Christ. That alone. Right. Is monumental as a break. So our. No, he didn't really convert people. Their response is, well, technically his victory was in a civil war, not over foreign enemies."}

There were a couple different types of public service in the Roman Empire. There was, of course, military service, but there was also just sort of public work service where you get kind of drafted to do work of the community. Right. Labor that you're eligible for. Christian clergy were exempted from that so that they could serve the liturgy and commemorate St. Constantine at the liturgy in prayer. Because this is where the word liturgy comes from. It means public works. Yeah, Right. So the Christian liturgy, Christian prayers, Christian worship was reclassified by St. Constantine as public service offered to the empire. So they were immune from all other public service when he built Constantinople. St. Constantine built Constantinople and made the pagans pay for it. Literally. Right."}

But it was mostly hanging instead of crucifixion. But he got rid of crucifixion because he said it was disrespectful to Christ, them to crucify people. One of the most interesting laws he issued was he issued a law that slaves and convicted criminals could not be branded except on their feet. Right. So one of the punishments in the Roman Empire for being convicted of certain crimes. Right. Or when you were a slave, to mark you out as a slave. Was you would be branded and they would generally brand you in a very conspicuous place because the idea was you don't want this slave to be able to cover it up and escape. You don't want, you know, criminals to be able to disguise the fact that they were convicted of this crime. You want them to be permanently marked. So they generally rebranded in the face. Yeah. Because that was really hard to cover up. And. And in that law, St. Constantine explicitly says that the reason criminals and slaves can no longer be branded on the face is that branding, the branding of the face, the disfigurement of the face, disrespected the image of Christ in which the person was created."}

It did not happen. It was not even discussed at the Council of Nicaea. Now, this is one of the ones where. Where, like, I have a theory maybe about how the misunderstanding that started the urban legend. Right. But the more I investigated it, the more I found that that's not at all what happened. So you will find testimony that after the Council of Nicaea, St. Constantine requested 50 copies be made of the Christian Scriptures. Right. So my thought is someone reading that sort of tried to connect the dots and said, well, wait a minute. Like, those copies must have had a table of contents and therefore, de facto. Right. That's a canon list. So. Right. Like, maybe that's where it came from. But as I investigate more, I discovered upon further research that he actually commissioned 50 gospel books."}

Right. Arians were not getting killed. They were not getting burnt. St. Constantine spent the rest of his life trying.

So not only did he not go and start killing all the Aryans. Right. Like, he was trying to see if we couldn't figure this thing out. Right, yeah. So. Yeah.

That's the one civil government function are allowed to do. That's pretty. And once again, testimony to. You know, this is the only testimony we have to the thoughts and feelings of St. Constantine.

Now, there were people at this time, for example, like St. Gregory of Nyssa. Well, a little after this time. But St. Gregory of Nyssa, two subsequent Paschas in his sermon told his people they had to free all their slaves because it was morally wrong for them to claim to own another person created in the image of Christ. We just talked about how the manumission office was the one office open on the Lord's day. Right. So, yeah, clearly Christianity was going to end slavery. But you can't do that in, like, a day by a bunch of bishops voting. Right. Because an empire is a complex economy with sources of labor and value generation and these kind of things. You can't just like flip a switch like, okay, now we're going to be capitalists, right?"}

These ideas did not exist yet. Right. You can't have capitalism really until you have the idea of enclosure and until you have the idea of commodity production at the beginning of industrialization, which didn't exist yet. Right. Like the ideas on which those later ideas were built did not exist yet. Right? So, yes, people like St. Gregory of Nyssa could look at the institution of slavery and say, this is wrong, and say to individual people, you need to not participate in this. Right? But if St. Constantine, let's say they'd taken a vote to end slavery and St. Constantine said, you're right, I hereby issue this law. Slavery is over. Everyone is free. What happens the day after?"}

Right. Is ridiculous and absurd and one of the stupidest things that's ever been said publicly anyway. Anyway, yeah, they couldn't have done that. Okay. This would have been.

Okay. So, yes, the Council of Nicaea did, you know, make a ruling against Arianism, though not strictly because there were still some semi Aryans kind of around. The Council of Nicaea did establish how you're supposed to date, Pascha. The Council of Nicaea did codify the findings of a bunch of preceding local councils. Let's see if you actually read the canons, they'll say, and this council and this council and the Council of Nicaea did establish the very important precedent of actually holding ecumenical councils.

And so again, this is a prejudice that's wormed its way deep into our brain of the idea of separation of church and state. Right, yeah. If you're an American, if you're not an American, you may not have separation of church and state per se, but the modern world, the modern west at least, definitely has an idea of a sacred sphere and a secular sphere. So there's the church and then there's the secular. Right. So there's the church authority and the secular authority. Right. And so if you have that paradigm in your head, then, hey, the emperor, he's this secular authority and he's coming in here to meddle in the Church's business. Right.

He's the first one to do it this way, even to separate it this much. Right, right. So, so, so this idea has not. Has not developed yet. But if we look at why St. Constantine says he called the council, he called the council because he wanted to preserve the peace of the empire, the peace and unity of the empire. Right. Not because he was dabbling in theology, not because he wanted to weigh in on one side or the other, not because he wanted an imperial church that would do his bidding. Right. It was because there was this theological issue that it seems like he didn't entirely understand at the time that was deeply troubling the empire, causing civil discord, strife, lack of unity and his job as the emperor, Remember, justice, everything in the right place, everything functioning properly, everything good. He's concerned about this. And so when you look at the canons of the council, you see, the canons are aimed at the communal life of the church and thereby the communal life of the empire."}

That said, it is the bishops who decide the issues. He calls the bishop together to decide these issues to preserve the peace and unity of the empire. As we mentioned a couple times Now, St. Constantine's theology, his own personal theology, you know, seems like he was probably some kind of semi Aryan. Right. Not a seminarian. Not all seminarians are semi Aryans."}

So it's hard to totally tell a lot of the case. A lot of times you'll see people very confidently saying that he was a semi Aryan. But the people, the main reason they're saying that so confidently is that they're thinking of, like, Eusebius of Nicomedia and Eusebius of Caesarea, who are semi Arians, who were in his inner circle."}

Nicomedia was sort of the bishop of Nicomedia was sort of the imperial chaplain for a while. So there, there's. So there's an element of guilt by association there. Now, I'm not saying he wasn't.

Again, we don't have access to his inner thoughts and feelings, but, you know, he probably was somewhere in that range because these are the guys he's hanging around with and. Right. As. As I mentioned before. He's trying to find some way to mediate this dispute. Right. He's not just falling on the Nicene side and saying, arius, you're no good, you're a heretic. He's still trying to reconcile things for the rest of Arius's life. Now, we do have the closest thing we do have to a sort of direct window into his theological thinking is he actually delivered what is commonly titled the Oration to the assembly of the Saints."}

There's five or six different public domain translations of it. It's all over the place. There's lots of really interesting things there that, again, are very confirmatory toward the idea that this guy is at least trying to figure out how to be a Christian. Right. And be the emperor. But, you know, it's not long enough and detailed enough. It's not like him presenting a systematic theology either, where you could figure out what he believed on all these different issues. But the key elements is speaking from a very Roman perspective in the sense that he's. He sees Christ as sort of the one who has delivered the Roman world, the Gentile Roman world, from idolatry. So there's a lot of distinction made there. Idolatry as an evil, the pagan worship as an evil, over against Christ as the Logos. Right. Bringing true knowledge of God Right. Over against idolatry. But he gets into some nuance. He has kind of a nuanced critique of Plato in there. He has. He talks about a number of different things, and he ends up sort of the. The last part of it is he's taking these ancient Roman pagan texts that he says are from the Sibylline books. It's hard to tell if that's true because the sibling books were kept secret and stuff. So I'm sure he thought they were from the sibling books, but whether they actually were or not is tricky. We've talked about those before on the show, but which he interprets as being prophecies of Christ that were given to the Roman civilization to prepare them for the coming of the Gospel."}

And like I said, it's not a systematic theology. You're not going to figure out whether he's a heretic or not from it in this case. But again, it gives further evidence that this guy's at least trying to think and function as a Christian. And what does now. Now that Christ had quite literally kind of appeared in his life."}

So I mentioned that aside from the, hey, he didn't kill all the pagans, so he must not have been a Christian. The other big argument is, and this is actually, this has a little more teeth to it, is the fact that after his conversion, he was manipulated politically into murdering his wife and his son. Which is bad. That's bad, yes. Those are horrible sins. Right. And horrible crimes. So we have to remember, though, that saints are saints based on how they end up, not based on having been like, perfect their whole life."}

But with St. Constantine in particular, we know he wasn't doing that because St Constantine, near the end of his life, was preparing to begin an Eastern military campaign, meaning he was going after the Persians. And this is a whole subtopic that this episode's gonna be a long one, but I don't have to be this long. Get into relations between him and the Persian Empire. But there was an exchange of letters between him and the Persians, and there were issues with Persian. The Persian Empire's persecution of Christians. There were a couple of Persian bishops who were at the Council of Nicaea. It's the whole thing. But. So he was going to begin this campaign in the east, and his plan was that on his way to the east to begin to lead this military campaign, he was going to stop off to be baptized in the Jordan."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #063 - 2023-03-09 - Saint Constantine the Great","start":7826.02,"end":7828.42,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Yeah. He wanted it where Jesus was baptized."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #063 - 2023-03-09 - Saint Constantine the Great","start":7828.98,"end":7945.91,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Yeah. And the then bishop of Alia Capitolina, formerly known as Jerusalem, was going to be one of the participants who was baptizing him. It was going to be a big thing. Right. So he had this all planned and then he got gravely ill. And so that campaign, at least under him, never happened. We won't talk about Julian the Apostate, his Eastern campaign and what happened there. But so that campaign never happened. And so he ended up, because he was sick, they baptized him where he was. Right. And that it ended up being his deathbed. Right. But that is because he got sick before the planned baptism and after he received that what's sort of an emergency baptism, he refused to put back on the imperial garb and refused to issue any more laws. He would only wear his white baptismal robe. And so he spent his last days in repentance. So all of this stuff goes into the understanding of him as Saint Constantine. Right. And yes, his life is very different than that of Saint Seraphim of Serav. Right. Or any number of other saints. Right. But the saints live different lives."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #063 - 2023-03-09 - Saint Constantine the Great","start":7947.43,"end":7947.95,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Yeah."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #063 - 2023-03-09 - Saint Constantine the Great","start":7947.95,"end":8058.3,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Right. St. Constantine's a little more Old Testament saint, maybe, than it's definitely not a monastic saint. Right. But yeah, yeah. So through all of this, through how he conducts himself. Right. Because again, he's figuring this out. How does one be a Christian Roman emperor? Right. How does one going. Go from being the at least semi divine. Right. Possessed by a genius, Right. Semi divine king and high priest of the Roman state, to being a Christian emperor ceding spiritual authority to other people. Right. He's figuring out how to do this in his own life. But what he sort of figures out is the beginning of sort of the template, sort of the pattern for what a Byzantine emperor, what a czar later is supposed to be like and how they're supposed to function. Right. Vis a vis the church. And so people may have heard the term Symphonia. Right. Speaking with the same voice that's used to describe the Byzantine emperor, the correct role between, like, the patriarch and the emperor. And again, sometimes we read into that our idea of the separation of church and state, or even our idea of like, sacred and secular spheres that are two different things. And that's not really the distinction between the two in their authority. Right. So the actual distinction is, for one thing, as we mentioned, the emperor cannot perform sacraments."}

Right. And the proper functioning of communal life. Those are his authority, serving as the icon of Christ. Right. In both senses. Right. So he has a ministry. He has a type of ministry, but it is not the same as the priestly ministry. Right. And so they function together in symphony. They are to function together in symphony in the same sense that a bishop and a priest and a deacon are supposed to function together in symphony. Right. Those three have different ministries, but they should all be functioning together on the same page and speaking with the same voice. We're just adding in the monarch who has this other separate ministry. Right. But which should be acting in concert pun kind of intended with the others. Right. And so now when we move into the third half, we will get into the sort of nitty gritty, we'll get to the actual topic and talk about the actual coronation of the emperor. And then after that sort of very practical side, we'll talk a little more about the way in which coming out of the New Testament, how all of this that we've been talking about informs our understanding of things like government and politics and those kind of things. Things which I'm sure will be super non controversial with everyone."}

Majeska. I don't know if it's Maeska or Majeska, but I want it to be Maeska. And so the book is actually a collection of, like it says on the label, you know, Russian travelers to Constantinople in the 14th, 15th centuries. And one of the travelers that he quotes the act, he actually includes the source material and then there's commentary and stuff is a text called the Journey of Ignatius of Smolensk. And this is from the late 14th century. So this is getting towards the end of the Eastern Roman, AKA Byzantine Empire, is when Ignatius of Smolensk makes this visit to Constantinople. One of the fun things about these travelers is that they go on these trips and then they write down the stuff that they saw. Often they are the only people writing these texts that we have because sometimes the people who are living there don't ever bother writing it down because, like, well, everybody knows what happens or whatever."}

So this is a rough outline of what his coronation actually would have looked like. So before they start the coronation, proper stonemasons walk up to the emperor and they show him chunks of marble. I'm not kidding about this. They show him chunks of marble and they say to him, what sort of tomb will your majesty order for himself? The idea being like, you're going to die.

And then he chants holy three times. Holy, holy, holy. So that sort of connects it, right, with the divine council, where we hear the thrice holy hymn. The people then they start chanting the holy over and over again. And while they do that, the patriarch anoints the head of the emperor with chrism in the form of a cross. And then, so then after that happens, the crown of the emperor is brought out from the sanctuary, from the, you know, the holy place, or we sometimes we call it the altar by two deacons. They bring the crown out, and then after that, then the empress's crown is brought out by relatives or by two eunuchs. I'm not sure whether there's eunuchs around, but There are eunuchs. And they then escort her to the center of the church. So she's not up on the ambo where her husband is. She's in the. Out on the Celia away is probably kind of roughly the center of the church up towards the front though, still. And then this is an interesting detail, and I want to look this one up because I'm not really sure what this is about. But the patriarch first puts a hood on the emperor's head and then he places the crown on it and then he chants Axios three times. So I mean, it's looking a little bit like an ordination in some ways."}

That, that again there's this ministry, there's this office being received by the emperor.

Let every person be subject to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and those that exist have been instituted by God. Therefore whoever resists the authorities resists what God has appointed. And those who resist will incur judgment. For rulers are not a terror to good conduct, but to bad. Would you have no fear of the one who is in authority? Then do what is good and you will receive his approval. For he is God's servant for your good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for he does not bear the sword in vain. For he is the servant of God, an avenger who carries out God's wrath on the wrongdoer. Therefore one must be in subjection not only to avoid God's wrath, but also for the sake of conscience. For because of this you also pay taxes. For the authorities are ministers of God, attending to this very thing. Pay to all what is owed to them. Taxes to whom taxes are owed, revenue to whom revenue is owed. Respect to whom respect is owed. Honor to whom honor is owed."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #063 - 2023-03-09 - Saint Constantine the Great","start":8928.09,"end":9136.12,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Right. So you see a couple elements there. One, as we were just referring to, that the civil magistrate. Right. In this case, the Roman authorities are God's servants. Yeah. And that's. And that the power, including the power of the sword, which is what a Roman emperor later had St. Paul killed with, is given to them by God. And so we see this element, that's the one side of the ruler as icon and as minister. And then St. Paul goes to the other side, Right. Which is that veneration and honor, right and obedience, which is owed to the other way. Again, not based on the goodness or right, anything, any other qualities of the particular ruler, but the fact that they are the person who is in this position of God given authority. Right. And this mostly a lot of the majority I wish all Orthodox people had this understanding with clergy. Right. That. That the respect that we pay to a bishop or to a priest or a deacon. Right. Is not based on their personal qualities, but based on the office they've received from God. That God is the person who will judge them and deal with them regarding how they've used that office and authority they've been granted. St. Paul is saying the same kind of thing is true of the governmental authorities because they also have this office from God and this responsibility from God. And this is St. Paul's position that he takes here is over. Against the increasingly popular array of Jewish positions at this time toward the Roman government that generally get categorized as zealotry. St. Paul has his own period of zealotry against the Church. Right. But it's not the, quote, unquote, political zealotry that, for example, is going to lead to the Jewish revolts are going to get Jerusalem destroyed. Right. There are, of course, three Jewish revolts, but much like the original Matrix trilogy, everybody only wants to talk about the first one. And they get worse as they go. But so, and this is so common, we see this reflected, right. Two of Christ's disciples, St. Simon the Zealot, obviously is labeled as a zealot, but this is also actually what Iscariot seems to mean in reference to Judas. Yeah. He was one of the Sicari, who were an extremely militant zealot group that literally spent their time assassinating Roman officials."}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #063 - 2023-03-09 - Saint Constantine the Great","start":9230.14,"end":9405.41,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Right. And so when that means he gets executed, he goes to his execution and becomes a martyr. Right, right. He doesn't try to get people to break him out. He doesn't. Right. So I think in part, this position that St. Paul takes is influenced by his past. He was born and spent his early years in Tarsus, and at one point after his conversion, not immediately after when he went to Arabia, but after went back to Tarsus for a period of time, probably at least a couple of years. And Tarsus is an interesting city and community. We won't spend too much time on it right now. But what's primarily interesting about it in this regard is that during the whole contest, so Tarsus is kind of in the crook where Asia Minor, what's now Turkey, meets the Levant. Right. Like what's now Lebanon. Right. Like in the crook there. And it's at the mouth of a river, so it's kind of centrally located there and became this strategic position. So like Antony and Cleopatra mustered their troops there for the Battle of Actium, for example. But in this regard, what's important is during the. The rivalry between Caesar and. And Pompey, Tarsus and its surroundings, including its very large Jewish community, were deeply loyal to Caesar, to Julius Caesar. And when they did that, Caesar took notice of it and he made Tarsus a free city, which gave them a bunch of tax exemptions and other things. And he issued a mass grant of citizenship not only to the officials in the city itself, but also to the prominent members of the large Jewish community who were his supporters in the area. This is how St. Paul ended up being a Roman citizen. Right. He tells when he's arrested in Jerusalem in acts, he tells the centurion that he received his citizenship by birth, which means likely his grandfather, based on the timing, was one of these Jews at the time who received Roman citizenship from Caesar. And then you're able to give that to your descendants. And the prominence of the support from this Jewish community is what led to the toleration of Judaism, not only in the area, but ultimately in the whole Roman Empire."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #063 - 2023-03-09 - Saint Constantine the Great","start":9407.09,"end":9407.57,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Wow."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #063 - 2023-03-09 - Saint Constantine the Great","start":9408.45,"end":9537.06,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"This is why the Jews were relatively. I mean, there were always issues. Caligula was crazy, tried to put a statue of himself in the temple of Jerusalem. Right. There were things. Right. But on the whole, and Claudius expelling the Jews from Rome, but on the whole, Jewish communities scattered around the Roman Empire could gen were generally exempt from having to engage in pagan sacrifice, from having to do these things. They were able to sort of live out their own lives within the larger community, keeping Torah. Right. But so that's the way of life that St. Paul experienced as a very young man and then again later in life. And so he had seen an example. I think this colored his view of the Gentiles and the Romans in general, too. He had seen that they were not entirely unreasonable, they were not animals. He had seen that if one was willing to give honor and respect to authority, not 100%, but a lot of the time, you would be allowed to, as he says in the pastoral epistles, live a quiet and peaceful life in godliness and sanctity. Right? You pay your taxes, you meet your obligations, you show the respect that these people deserve, and they basically leave you alone. Right? And so that seems to have colored his position because that's sort of the position he takes for Christians of how Christians should try to live in this pagan world. Right. Is the same kind of thing. Give respect to who it's due, pay your taxes. Right. Do good in your community. Right. And good things will follow, or at least they'll mostly leave you alone. Right. But St. Paul also had a game plan. This is also very clear both in Acts and in his epistles. And the culmination of that game plan, the end game of it, was that he wanted to preach the gospel to and convert the emperor."}

Maybe not of everything that would happen afterwards, but they could conceive of a world in which that could happen, and that if that happened, how much of the world would then become Christian and how would the world change and how would idolatry cease? Right. So this is very much in tune with the first century gospel. So there's not this great disjunction, right, that. That almost all of those conspiracy theories and a bunch of others we didn't mention are based on that Christianity was going in this one direction, and then Constantine comes and derails it and takes it in this other direction.

And again, I hate to tell everybody, but in the real world it's not coming back in our lifetime. But we're not going to end on a depressing note like that. Yeah, we're not going to end on a depressing note like that. So what? Right? We don't have monarchy. We definitely don't have a sacramentally coordinated emperor or king. Who's the head? Who's the actual head of state? The functioning head of state. So can we just scrap this episode? Why did we bother doing it? Just a historical curiosity. Right. For nerds."}

Even if they're orthodox, we're not saying you should do this, but we're going to look at this and then we're going to take some lessons from this. Yes. Okay.

And so then fast forward a bit into. In the liturgy, when it's time for communion, the Emperor, he receives the Eucharist from the Patriarch. Notice he does not go get it himself, he receives it from the Patriarch, and he communes along with all the clergy. So he communes at the altar with the clergy, and then the empress is communed within the sanctuary. So she's there, she's inside the holy place, but she's not like at the altar with the clergy, but she's communed within. And so that's how the emperor and the empress, at least at this later Byzantine period, received Holy Communion."}

And so even though, again, we do not communicate our civil magistrates this way. This idea that the authority that the civil magistrate has, whether he's the mayor, whether he's the tax assessor, whether he's the President of the United States, whether he's the prime minister, is given to them by God. Right. They are, in a sense, a minister of God with responsibilities. Right. To promulgate, again, not their own will, but the law and commandments of God. And to serve as image in those two senses. Right. That they are to image the rule of Christ over the earth. Right. By how they conduct their office. And they are honored.

People come down on different sides of this, right? Like, should I vote at all? Right. If, if the available candidates who theoretically could win the election are all problematic, should I not. Should I not vote? What if that's always kind of true? Should I just never vote? Or is there some kind of responsibility? Does that being a magistrate of a sort mean that I have a responsibility to exercise that power, which would of course have come from God, and therefore do. Am I, should I vote? Do I have a duty to go and vote and exercise that power in some sense. Right. This is not something that has been fully thought through in terms of the orthodox tradition.

Wow, it looks great. It's so glorious and shiny. Despite the fact that, of course, the vast majority of even orthodox Christian monarchs were not great.

Most people are living way down at the bottom. Right. And that can be for our salvation. But I think that the vast majority of Orthodox Christians or any Christians or whoever is listening to this are not pining for monarchy, are not monarchists, are not ideologues along these lines. Most are probably just asking the question of, well, how am I supposed to understand all this? And how am I supposed to make sense of the fact that, largely speaking, most of these monarchs have not been good people or even decent people in a lot of cases? What are you supposed to do with that? You know, I think one of the things that, as I've studied history over the course of my life that I've discovered, and I think particularly in the last several years, as I've made a deep study of some particular times or places of history, is that you kind of have two choices of where you can land in terms of being a Christian and reading this kind of stuff and trying to understand it. One is that you can become very cynical. And certainly people do, right, that often there's a pretty bad track record. And I mean, you know, you don't even have to just look at kings and queens and emperors and empresses. You can even just look at clergy. There's often a pretty bad track record. So that's one way you can become cynical. You can say it's all just bunk or forget it, I've had enough. But the other way is the way that I prefer, and the one that I think is actually the Christian way, honestly, which is to look at all of it with hope. Hope. And our hope is in the king of kings, right? The scripture, at the same time that it says, put not your trust in princes or in sons of men, also says all these things about good kingship. But it's not to say that even David is the end, is, you know, the point at which all of this has become what it's supposed to be. Because not even he who's man after God's own heart, not even he was the one that all kingship was pointing towards. That's Christ. Christ is the one. And so our hope is not a hope in any particular government system. It's not a hope in the rise of a pious, saintly, holy, orthodox emperor. That's not what it is. And honestly, I mean, I had this thought a number of times when we were preparing for this episode, which is, you know, let's imagine here in America that there's a king. What kind of king would America generate? Probably most of us would not want her to live under that king. Not great. So, you know, that aside, though, the point of all this is to point us towards Christ. And so what do you do in the meantime? I think one of the Things that you discover, especially as you study church history in particular, is that while there is the grand game of power and borders and territories and riches and all this kind of stuff, while that is always going on in this life, there is a more important story that is also going on. And it's not that these two stories have nothing to do with each other, they have everything to do with each other. But it is that the story of the saints who are sort of the through line of all of this, that is going to be revealed at the end of time as the story of those who are in a sense really ruling."}

Right? They're the ones co reigning with Christ. And they show us what that looks like by doing it. You know, what does it look like for the saints to reign in glory? It looks like what they're doing for us right now. You know, they are intercessors for us before the throne of God. They also help to minister and to manage this creation in concert with God. And the more that you look at even the very, very dark chapters of history, I think the more. And if you look at it really, really honestly and, and seek out the face of Christ in this, then you will see that there's always hope. Sometimes it feels kind of buried, but there is always hope. There's always hope. And if we look at history and if we look at questions of kingship and monarchy and government with triumphalism, then it's going to go very dark. It's going to get super dark, because that's really about power. But if we look at it with hope, then we're looking for Christ because He is our hope. He is the hope of the hopeless, the Savior of the storm tossed. And I think that's the way that many of us, especially at this point right now in American history in particular, again, I know that lots of our listeners are not Americans, but most of y' all are, and certainly in other parts of the world too. So even if you're not American, that it can feel pretty hopeless. It can feel pretty storm tossed. There's a lot of nutty stuff going on, dangerous stuff, despairing stuff, depressing stuff. And yet we always have our hope in Christ. Always, always. Above all other people, Christians should be joyful. And our joy is possible because Christ is king. He also has sub kings under Him. And inasmuch as our government officials are showing that as icons, thank God, we still need to honor them and respect them and obey them in as much as they don't tell us to disobey God. But ultimately it's the saints who are really those co. Reigners with Christ. And everything points finally to him. Father Stephen."}

And what I mean by that, we may be more aware of the hyper political side, right? All of a sudden, where you buy a chicken sandwich and who gets cast as the Little Mermaid is a political act of some sort. Everything, every movie that comes out, every TV show that comes out, every announcement of anything, any opinion, any performance, any song, any anything is folded into a weird partisan politics thing. At the same time, though, really, things are completely apolitical because none of that continued churn of lining up on either side of literally everything ever produces any change in the world, ever has any kind of actual effect on anyone's real life.

You got people out there who are anarcho primitivists who dream of living in the woods with a rock or something. You've got people like me who are radical anti centrists. You've got Marxist, Leninist, Maoist tankies, right? You've got all these people who put all these labels on themselves and sort of performatively issue these statements on social media as their quote, unquote, political identity. But it's just sort of an identity, sort of, you know, like being a jock or a stoner or a goth in high school, right? Like you, you put this thing on yourself or, or if you're, if you've decided to identify with more mainstream politics, right, you repost things and you line up on either side of everything. But none of that has anything to do with what politics actually is. If you go back to, as is my want, say, Aristotle's politics, right? Politics is just the ethics of life and community together. And we may not be able to recreate in our present day the kind of biblical and traditional model that we described in today's episode. But we can certainly exercise Christian. I don't want to say morality, but Christian ethics, right? A Christian way of life, a Christian way of being in the world. You could follow the teachings of the Orthodox Church and the way of life that the Orthodox Church represents in community with each other. The biggest barrier to that right now is not that the Christian ethic is so hard to follow, or not that we don't love and care about the other people who go to our church. It's that we aren't actually living communal lives at all. We're all isolated, signaling our respective stances on things, performatively on social media. We're all sort of consuming media and or chicken sandwiches to indicate where we stand on things and that we're a good person and not one of those bad people. And we're not engaging with each other. But there's also nothing stopping us from doing that in the sense that no one is going to physically halt us from going down to the church, to staying there and talking to people, to helping people there who need help, visiting with each other, in each other's houses, spending time together, addressing issues in that community, addressing issues in the broader community around us. I'm not talking about whole nations. I'm not even necessarily talking about whole cities. It might just be neighborhoods. It might just be, hey, you know what? A lot of trash gets left on our street. Why don't we go out and pick it up together and spend time together doing that? And maybe while we're out there, we'll actually meet some of the other people who live next door to us and who live in our area, who we've never talked to, and we don't know their names. And maybe when we talk to them and they talk to us, maybe they might become part of our community and our church community. And maybe we can start to transform this thing. And maybe that's what politics actually is, at least what Christian politics actually is. And those things can start small in a few places. They can actually grow very quickly. Places could be transformed very quickly. And before you know it, the world we live in, maybe not the world out there, maybe not the world that's funneled to us by cable news and through the Internet and over social media, but the world we actually live in, once we go out and start living there in community, can be very transformed and very different. And we could feel very different about it and about our lives. And we can feel a sense of connection that we've lost. And even if we don't have a single human king to represent Christ to us in terms of the civil authority, there are all kinds of people in our community who have leadership qualities, who have expertise in different areas, who can both represent Christ and the way of life in Christ to us, and who are worthy of our respect in return. So even though this is a sacrament, we've just described that, as I already said, probably no one listening to this is going to get to participate in during our lifetimes, the fundamental reality of it, the work of God that it represents in our communities and our communal life, is something we can at least taste when we take seriously the fact that we're living together and that we want the life that we live together to be one of good order, of holiness, of righteousness, and therefore of justice."}
