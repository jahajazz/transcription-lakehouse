And he will be the light of the nations and the hope of those whose hearts are troubled. All who dwell on the earth will fall down and worship him. And they will praise and bless and celebrate with song the lord of spirits. First Enoch, chapter 48, verses 4 through 5. The modern world doesn't acknowledge, but is nevertheless haunted by spirits, angels, demons and saints. In our time, many yearn to break free of the prison of a flat secular materialism, to see and to know reality as it truly is. What is this spiritual reality like? How do we engage with it? Well, how do we permeate everyday life with spiritual presence? Orthodox Christian priests, Father Andrew Stephen Damick and Fr. Stephen DeYoung host this live call in show focused on enchantment in creation, the the union of the seen and unseen as made by God and experienced by mankind throughout history. Welcome to the Lord of Spirits."}

So you know how on the road to Emmaus, after the Lord is resurrected, it says that he. The scriptures say that beginning at Moses and all the prophets, the Lord expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself, Right? So to those people, he had already been resurrected. And they had already, I guess in modern day terms, you would say bent the knee to the Lord. They had already sort of given their hearts over to Christ crucified. You know, like as orthodox Christians worship Christ crucified. We don't do the Protestant, you know, coming in on a white horse, Jesus. We do Christ crucified. And so we were looking, my husband and I both, we've been looking in and maybe you can help us out. We've been looking in acts as well as the Gospel, for an example, where somebody who had not yet bent the knee, let's say somebody who wasn't yet saved. Somebody who wasn't yet, you know, Christian, really had this, you know, a similar thing happen where beginning at Moses and the prophets, everything was expounded. Like, in other words, even with Nicodemus, right. When the Lord is talking to Nicodemus prior to Nicodemus, accepting him as Lord and Savior, he talks to him like a child. That, you know, what is it, chapter three, where he says, you know, don't you know the difference between flesh and spirit? I read that to children, and children can understand that. And then also in acts, you know, St. Paul, like, when he's talking to the Greeks and they're so scholarly and smart, he comes at them like children. He's like, oh, I see you got this statue here of an unknown God. I know who he is, you know, but afterwards, after they get saved in the epistles, he's very detailed, and he gets into scriptures. So the only time that I can find where either The Lord or St. Paul is using scriptures with the Jews is when he's kind of like correcting them or refuting them or like, they say something wrong, and then either St. Paul or the Lord is like, no, no, no, you got that wrong."}

And when we, like the Great Commission, go out and preach to all nations, when we preach to people, is it like pearls before swine if somebody's not saved and you get into scripture with them? Okay, did I ask that, right? Did that make sense?"}

He talks to. Is it the Corinthians, Father, where he talks about our, you know, your fathers in the faith, even though they're literally not descended from Abraham. Yeah. I mean, they're making use of Scripture all the time. All the time. Right. Now, you apply it in different ways depending on your audience. So, you know, Luke and Cleopas on the road to Emmaus, you know, these guys are. Are both catechized already. Right. So obviously you can get much deeper into it. With them. And. And there's more to say at this point because he's risen from the dead. So it's all been revealed now."}

I don't know a lot of Orthodox people who do that, but some people do that, and I don't think that's helpful because I. I don't think that a person who is completely outside the realm of the scriptures can understand the Scriptures or have the Scriptures mean anything to them. Right. A lot of the tradition of the Orthodox Church is maintained intentionally, internally. Not that it's kept secret, but you don't go out and try and argue people into believing individual doctrines or something either. Right. You have to become part of the community of the faithful to really understand these things and have them make sense to you. Right. Because ultimately it's the Holy Spirit who reveals these things to people. Right. It's not the text itself."}

I don't think it's wrong to ever walk through a biblical passage with someone outside the church, but I also think in most cases it's. It's not all that helpful of an approach. I think the, the, the casting Pearls Before Swine is more that at a certain point you have to kick the dust off of your feet. Right. Like if you're trying to talk to someone seriously about Christ and all you're getting in response is, for example, mockery or something, Right. Then it's not good to just stand there and continue the mockery and let them mock holy things. That's not good for them. Right, that's. And that's not good for anyone else. That's what I think the Casting Pearls Before Swine is more about is. It's more about, you know, not just don't give something to somebody that they're not ready to receive, but don't give something to somebody that they're going to abuse or mock or. Right. Cast aside, you know."}

And I was kind of curious listening to the whole Counsel of God podcast. Father Stephen had said that because the Jews had become holy enough, that is what allowed Jesus to then come into Mary because finally the people were holy enough to be around God. And it's kind of a two part question where I looked into a lot of things in the Orthodox Church. I grew up Lutheran, but I also joined the Mormon Church.

I think there's two ideas there being brought together that are related but not identical. Right. So the Pharisees believed that when the people as a whole had become holy by keeping Torah, that that's when the Messiah would come. That was. And that was a communal, like the idea of the people as a whole. Right. And that was based on some pretty straightforward reasoning. Right. They read the Old Testament, they said, well, the reason we were put into exile in the first place, the reason all this happened to us in the first place, was disobedience to the Torah. So if we become obedient, then we'll be blessed instead of cursed."}

I. Well, I think one of the times I talked about this may have been in when we're going through Revelation and talking about whether the Woman in Revelation 12 represents the Theotokos or Israel. And my answer was, porque dolos dos? Essentially for this reason. Right. That she is sort of the embodiment of that faithful and holy remnant. Right, in Israel. That line, that family line that we see being drawn through Israelite history, sort of the culmination of it in the way that she's a culmination of that line in the way that St. John the Forerunner is the culmination of the prophets of the Old Covenant."}

My question was, I read a book recently by a hospice nurse who's talked about her experience helping people to transition from this life to the next. And she said that in her experience, a very common thing that would come up is people would see their deceased loved ones or close friends or something like that coming to, like, coming to get them and take them to the other side. And she said this was so common that, like, when she initially started, she thought, oh, they're hallucinating. But apparently that was just like a thing that happens all the time. And the part that was puzzling to me about that was not necessarily people showing up, but then the fact that she said there seemed to be no pattern based on religion that she could detect it would be Christians and Muslims and atheists and whatever who would have these people show up as. I was just wondering what Yalls take on that was like, what are these people experiencing?"}

Right, because my presupposition would be, okay, well, if the Christians are, like, going to heaven and the non Christians are not, as a general principle, then it would make sense that, like, other deceased Christians would come get them or something like that. Right. Or like, the angels would show up and get them, like you hear about sometimes in some of the various stories from the fathers and stuff. But there seems to be no correlation there."}

I mean, the first thoughts that I have about this is like, number one, it's anecdotal to begin with. Right. This is one hospice nurse's experiences. I'm not saying she didn't have these experiences. Right. But to take that and then try to establish a pattern and, you know, extrapolate some kind of meaning from that. You know, like a kind of sociology of. Of. Of the last moments of death. And then also the fact that different people are having various kinds of experiences and they're describing it in their own words. Or maybe, you know, relatives nearby are the ones who Are reporting these. Like, it's just. It's kind of. There's too many. Too many variables that are, by definition, not objective that I think that you could actually, you know, kind of come to some sort of conclusions based on this right now. I mean, I would not say that these people, as they're dying, are not seeing something or not experiencing something or whatever, but there's so many questions about, like, what exactly. Who exactly are they seeing or experiencing? And what is the basis for the interpretation they're giving that experience and on and on and on. I mean, there's just kind of too much for me to be able to say, oh, this is what's going on here, you know? I don't know. Father Steven, you have any comments on this?"}

And the way they were observing it was with the patients, like, talking to these people on an ongoing basis for, like, a few hours to, like, a day or so before they passed.

See, I think part of the dissonance is we've been so trained to this idea of you die and you're a Christian and you go to heaven and you die and you're not a Christian and you go to hell. So wait, why are the departed loved ones greeting the non Christian? Right. But that's not really. Right. Our eschatology, including yours, I don't think that's actually the way you view things, right? Like, caller, I don't think that's how you view things. But the. The dissonance comes from that sort of presupposition, right? So if we have a different presupposition. If we have a different presupposition that everyone experiences the bodily resurrection, so everyone's life, right? At least aspects of it become eternal in either a positive or a negative way, right? Then we would expect the end of someone's life at the end of someone's life for them to be experiencing in some way their life to that point, right? I'm not just talking about like, oh, you're about to die and your life flashes before your eyes, right? But they would be experiencing their past, their past decisions, right? Their past sins, their. Their past repentance, the people they knew, right? All of that would come to revisit them at the point of death, right. Regardless of their eternal destiny. Because again, that's part and parcel of the bodily resurrection in that it's part and parcel of our identity being maintained through death and out the other side. So I would put it into that category that it's an experience related to the end of everyone's life and sort of the re. Experiencing of that life."}

But, but the pagan belief was that these are two different embodiments of ultimately the same spiritual power of the same spirit. Right. And that's not what we say about the relationship of icons of the Theotokos to the Theotokos. For the most part, the names of the different icons are ways of just distinguishing them based on visual features or the places where they came to rest, in some cases through various chains of events in order to distinguish them from others. Yeah, yeah, because they're somewhat different depictions or they're a particular icon that had a particular history or provenance."}

My question is, I've been listening along from the first podcast friend told me about a little while back, and so just going through a lot of the things really, like, made sense of what things I've already had, kind of had an idea for, but couldn't explain to myself in a way, explain for myself. So, like the. Those putting on where. Where God put on flesh. Garments of flesh for Adam and Eve to give them the. The, you know, so that they wouldn't be crystallized in their evil, in their sin."}

And then one. One new thing that I hadn't heard before growing up with a background and, you know, Protestant background for the most part, was, you know, I never heard about or, you know, thought about how, you know, praying for the departed unbelievers who, you know, as if they could receive Christ or as if they could be saved then after. Is that not like knowing when their spirit leaves their body and is crystallized, you know? All right, is that the point where it'd be crystallized in there at that point, so then it wouldn't be too late for them? I didn't know if that was a. Trying to make sense of that."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #090 - 2024-04-11 - Pantheon and Pandemonium X - Live Q&A April 2024","start":2690.7,"end":2832.4,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Yeah, I think I know what you're saying. So there's a couple of things that are important to pick apart a little bit from each other to distinguish, really. So St. John of Damascus in particular, but other church fathers say that the mortal body is what enables us to repent. So God gives us mortality. He gives us the garments of skin. That enables us to repent. How exactly that works, we don't know the mechanism, but he describes it, St. John describes it as being subject to changeability, essentially. Right. But obviously it's a particular kind of changeability that's required for repentance. And so when you're dead and your soul is parted from your mortal body, you no longer have that capability. You can't repent. Right. But salvation comes through the mercy of God. And people who are still in their mortal bodies can repent on behalf of someone who's not. Who's departed from their mortal body. Right. And God can have mercy on that person through. I shouldn't say God can. God does have mercy on people as he. As he wills. I mean, we can't force anything as he wills, he has mercy on people through the repentance of those who are still capable of repenting. So even though they're not able to repent anymore, that does not mean that their eternal status is fixed. Right. There's saints who were given visions of the fact that they, through their prayers, that pagans. In one particular example I think we've mentioned before, St. Gregory the Great, also called Gregory the dialogist, was given a vision that through his prayers, the Emperor Trajan had been released from Hades. Which, I mean, that's interesting because Trajan was a pagan and I mean, he's the guy who, who martyred St. Ignatius of Antioch. And. Yeah, so there must have been something there to work with. Right. But, you know, through, through St. Gregory's prayers, he was released from Hades. So just because you can't repent anymore doesn't mean that there's not any possible hope for you now, for you in this life. This is your time to repent. Like, you can't say, well, I'm just gonna wait."}

No, I just thought of this because there's been the question that I haven't been able to answer, but I've been asked before, like who? You know, what about people who weren't presented with the gospel, you know, Native Americans, before settlers out here kind of thing. You know, how is that fair that they weren't, you know, exposed to the gospel and, you know, then they don't get to hear it and then they don't get to heaven."}

And there's emphasis there on what they do. Right. So part of the issue here is that the broad evangelical culture in the United States has bled into all of us where we have this idea that there is like hundred percent overlap between Christian member of the church and saved. And those are three different categories that overlap a little. A couple of them, a lot, but not entirely any of them."}

In the parable of the sheep and the goats, Christ does not say, you heard and believed the gospel, therefore you are sheep at my right hand. You didn't hear it or heard it and rejected it, so you are goats. That's not what he says.

Right. And so we're going to be accountable for what we do in this life with that. Not what we think, not what we post online and signal about, but what we actually do. And the person who has much less. St. Paul also talks about in Romans 10, remember the fact that. And in Romans 1, he's more positive in Romans 10 that those people out there in the nations, you know, before they heard the gospel, had heard something like the gospel. He literally says through astrology, but through. Through the creation."}

There were those who didn't never heard of a Torah in their life right out there in the nations, but who kept the Torah and were a Torah unto themselves, he says. So all that is to say when it comes to prayers for the departed. Right. This is why we do memorial services for departed Christians. Right. We're praying for the souls of departed Christians.

Okay, so my question. So basically it has to do with the fact that Israel was given all this land by God. All of this land is supposedly being transferred to Christ in the church, though I don't exactly understand how that plays out practically in any way apart from just something that is said. And then even moreover, from that, the church makes its way out into the entire world. There are all these sort of jubilee laws in the Old Testament. How on earth can that even be applied when there aren't even. We don't exactly have boundary markers for who in England is supposed to get what in the Torah. I suppose that makes sense. So I don't know exactly how that's supposed to work, but maybe you could help me understand it."}

So we translated earth there, Right. So I think that the way to understand the land promises and what's set up there is that it serves the purpose of a sign in the sense that very commonly when a prophecy was given in the Old Testament, but also in the New Testament, some immediate sign was given that would serve as a kind of assurance of the larger promise that was projected out into the future."}

Like when the angels come to the shepherds at the birth of Christ, they say, you know, the Messiah has been born. The stars sing and everything. And then they say, this shall be assigned to you. You will find a baby wrapped in swaddling clothes, laying in a manger, laying In a food trough, right? That's not something you see every day, right? So they were saying, go now, go. Look, you will see this and then you'll know that what we're telling you is true, that that baby is the Messiah, right? It serves as a sign. Same thing is true in the original context of Isaiah 7, which is where the virgin will have a son or the young woman will have a son there. It's during the Syro Ephraimite war. And Isaiah says everyone's concerned because the northern kingdom of Israel and the Syrians have teamed up to attack Judah. And Isaiah prophesies, you know, this woman here is going to have a child. And before that child is old enough to know right from wrong, right, before he's fully suckled from his mother, God will have delivered you, right? And so when the people saw her give birth to that baby, right? They would say, okay, look, there's the baby, right? This is the sign that God is going to deliver us from these armies that are arrayed against us, right? So the land promises to Abraham function in the same way. Because in those promises there are sort of two tiers of those promises to Abraham. The first tier is, I'm going to give you a bunch of descendants, right? Even though you currently have none. And during his life, he only really saw one who was going to inherit at least four, if you count everybody. But I'm going to give you this incredible number of children and I'm going to give you this land. I'm going to give this land to them, to your descendants. But then there was also this promise of you will be like the stars of heaven. You will camp in the gates of your enemies. All nations of the world will be blessed through you. This idea of sort of the singular seed, that there was something coming at the end of this line of Abraham beyond just the seed, plural in general, right? The literal physical descendants. And so the land and the sort of more material, not really material descendants. That's the wrong word. The direct descendants of Abraham coming into and possessing the land was the sign of those larger promises. This is how Hebrews treats it. For example, it talks about Abraham actually hoping for a promised land, that is the new heavens and the new earth, right? The resurrection. So those promises were fulfilled at the end of Joshua as the assurance to the people of Israel that the broader promises were true. That further then was nuanced into the hope of the Messiah coming once we have David is sort of the model of that. And the particulars of the bodily resurrection that emerge over the course of the old covenant, in their understanding of how exactly those larger promises are going to play out. And so ultimately, because the land that material land is pointing to is the new heavens and the new earth."}

I can show you that idea in all kinds of paganism, starting with Athenian, Greek paganism, that there is some connection between a particular people and a particular piece of soil.

So Roman emperors are interesting and complex beasts. That's beasts used there very deliberately in that. First of all, most of them were not proclaimed to be divine while they were alive. Most.

Right. Probably like Caligula and Nero would be near the top. Right. Just in terms of doing, like, really evil stuff and persecuting the church. But Nero, for example, had this really complex relationship with religion because he'd killed his own mother. And of course, publicly did not kill his mother. Right. But privately knew he had killed his mother. And so he would go to, you know, famous temples and places where Greek mysteries were practiced because he was fascinated by them, but he would never participate. And there were temples he wouldn't enter because he thought he would be killed for having killed his mother."}

He would he would be killed for it. And even though at various times in his life, he did sacrifices and things that he thought would expunge it, he was never confident enough that it had been expunged until the day he killed himself to really deal with that.

And I think, Father Andrew, you made a pun about, like, how somebody might translate your name as the crowned man. And it got me thinking about how we can find things like that in the scriptures if we're reading them for personal study. The question is generally, is, is there a way to look at the text as they were in their original language and tell when the writer is intending to describe a personal name as opposed to a word that has a same or similar meaning?"}

So speaking from a kind of linguistic point of view, I mean, in some cases, the form of the word says that it's a name. Right. But in others, it's not so obvious, and you have to know from context. And sometimes knowing from context is not just about knowing the text of the scripture, but also knowing the cultural and religious context. Right. So, like, you know, Father Stephen has mentioned, you know, in the Psalms, where it. Where it asks for protection from the arrow that flieth by day. Well, you know, that's a reference to Reshef, but if you don't know who Reshef is, or Reshef is a God that shoots plague arrows, then you're just gonna know that it seems to be a word that means arrow. Right. As an example. So I don't know that there's an easy way, especially when you're reading in translation, which, you know, most of us are doing. Right. You know, to just instantly tell. Right. So I think that's why a lot of study can help if you're trying to understand the Scriptures at. At that level. I don't know. You have anything to. To add, Father?"}

I'm hoping to get your take on a question about predeterminism coming from a Calvinist that led to an atheist that led to perhaps a heretical view of Christianity. If I'm being honest, I haven't been able to shake a belief in determinism throughout all of those transitions. And I don't see how to conceptualize God as omni benevolent, omniscient, omnipotent, and still see a space for my free will. I was hoping you could respond. Maybe I could throw out a provocative example. I think there is space for free will in the sense that God is creating that free will within us, even right now. And the arch center I've heard you reference, I think there's a space. Cain's actions is predetermined. And Reid, his sacrifice of Abel as not sinful in the sense of jealousy or envy, but in the sense of him trying to appease a God who has judged his prior sacrifice quit. He's saying to God, am I my brother's keeper? Because if he is, that would imply that he had to sacrifice the work, the effort, the labor that he put into Cain, and that's what he was trying to appease God with. So I see there is a way to read the Bible in this kind of predetermined sense that says, yes, we're sinners in that we judge the world as evil. God has created is good."}

So, okay, if humans weren't capable of dying prior to the expulsion from the garden, and God's logic sort of for expelling us from the garden is so that we wouldn't eat from the Tree of Life and become immortal, why would we need to eat from the Tree of Life to become immortal if we were already immortal?"}

I would say it's not a matter of becoming immortal. Right. And also we should remember that the kind of death that God gives at that point is the death of the body because their souls had already become, I don't know, dying at that point because they had separated themselves from God. Right. And so. So what God gives then is the mortality of the. Of the material body so that we would be enabled to repent. The tree. There's the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil and the Tree of Life. Right. And so if. And but here's the thing about immortality is that it is not something that humans have ever had in themselves. It was always sort of continuously granted and sustained by God. Only God is immortal in himself. Right. Humans were never. We're not even created immortal in ourselves. So. So what's going on there is they're being cut off from that sort of supply of life, as it were. I don't know. What do you think, Father?"}

So exactly what, for example, Adam and Eve sort of technically man and woman's experience of God was in paradise, right. Isn't something we can define or describe. And this is why you find some of the church fathers saying that essentially they fell immediately, that there was no time, as we understand it now, between when they were created and when they fell. Right. Because even time, the experience of time, was something different in paradise, right? So, you know, it's not that, you know, oh man, if we could just get over the wall and get past that cherub and eat it, we'd live forever. Right.

Yeah, I guess I had it like, it seemed like a sort of like progression, I guess the way I was like understanding it. Like, you know, they're, they're forbidden from eating of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil until they're ready. And then God would have decided to give it to them, like, and then they would have been given fruit from the Tree of Life, I guess is how I was kind of understanding it because I, in trying to like square this in my own head, like I was. The idea that I had come to was that they were actually mortal in the garden, but not necessarily like subject to death because they were in the garden with God and if everything had just gone according to plan, they would eat from the knowledge. They would eat from the Tree of Knowledge and then eat from the Tree of Life and then, you know, they're technically mortal in that state. But death would have never really had been a factor given that they were going to be within the garden and you know, work to expand out."}

So I had an interesting background coming into Orthodoxy. I've been orthodox for about three years, and before that I kind of went to a more mainline and progressive church, and I was spending some time with some friends from there recently, and they asked why we pray for the dead as Orthodox Christians. And I said to them, it really kind of presupposes there will be a resurrection and there will be a personal judgment, or else it doesn't really make any sense to pray for the dead. And so we talked about that for a little while and then we talked about the eternal state. And I mentioned that I've heard lots of orthodox priests say that people kind of experience the energy and the Presence of God positively or negatively for eternity based on how they live their lives. And that, that's kind of a more comforting picture to me than like a fiery hell that God like created to burn you in. And the next day I started thinking about it and was like, those two ideas don't combine for me. So I guess my question is, what does it work like that? Does it work like we, we encounter the river of fire or whatever in a, in a way that our lives have prepared us for, to receive it either as judgment or as love or mercy. But if that's the case, it seems like God could just be some giant crystal to just like emanate the judgment. Like there's no personal decision. Like, does Christ examine my life and make a personal decision about my life that determines the outcome or is it just kind of automatic? It doesn't seem like it can be both."}

And I think a lot of people find that idea that like, well, God is just sort of loving everyone in the same way. And you know, some people receive it as good and some people receive it as bad. And I've even heard some people say things like, you know, it's like when your, your old great aunt, you know, grabs hold of you when you're a little kid and gives you a big smooch. You know, she loves you but you hate it. Right. I've seen that as the description. Right. I don't know if you've seen that, but I've seen that. And you're right. Like it seems to take away this sense of actual agency and judgment from God that he's just this kind of force. Right. Which is not how the scriptures depict him.

For what we've done in this life, the concrete life we've lived. That is the subject of his judgment. And we're praying to him for mercy, Right. We're not praying in memorial prayers.

Specifically from the Mennonite region of Manitoba. So maybe there's fragments of Low German in there. But anyway, so my. My question. I have two. In case the first one isn't any good, but. So the first one's about ancient monotheism. I know you guys have talked about it a little bit on the show before where there's some new. New, I don't know, studies showing that more like hunter gatherer tribes that we've discovered over the time, you know, there's clear indication that their first religions were monotheists. And so I had a question about that in regards to some of the missionary stuff that happened in Alaska. I've been listening and reading some of Father Michael Oleski's stuff about Alaska and the missionary activity that went on there. And the way he talks about it, he talks as if, like, you know, the people of Alaska, you know, they were so ready to hear the message of Christ and all these things, even though obviously they didn't have the word Yahweh and the word Christ and the same biblical stories. He talks about some of these stories, and they just fit in so well with the biblical narrative and principles and all these things. And so it just got me wondering, like, how do we think about that? Like, was the God they were already worshiping, could that be Yahweh? Or could they be still following one of these good spirits that was leading the nations after the Tower of Babel? Is it. Is there a chance some of them preserved some of these people, like the people in Alaska, so that they'd be ready to hear the message?"}

But. Well, okay, several things. Right. Number one, and it's funny, we get this question all the time, like, is it possible that there are any of the spirits of the nations that did not fall? And, like. Well, you know, post Babel. Right. If that were the case, then why would God create Israel? Why would he need a new nation? Right. If there was still a nation out there that that was still worshiping him. And you know, no, I mean all, all the nations fall, right? So that's why there's this new nation. I don't know. I don't know very much beyond the tiniest outline of Alaskan paganism. The idea that they were really monotheist. I mean that's kind of a category we've, I mean in our earliest episodes we talked about this. This is kind of a, a category that gets sort of invented in the Enlightenment, right? The idea that only one God exists."}

Like, yeah, like they have, like, like there's a lot of animal stuff going on there. Like they believed in multiple spirits, but they only worship the Creator. And then all. Saint Innocent of Alaska, he. There were writings about some conversations he had with shamans where the shamans, instead, they were taught by these spirits. The spirits wouldn't let them worship them. And so Saint Innocent assumed that maybe this guy was actually in contact with angels because the things that morality wise, anyway, the things these spirits were teaching him seemed to, you know, they fell in line with Christian morality."}

I mean, there's no reason why that could not be the case. Right? So yeah, I don't know. Father, is there anything you wanted to add or subtract or multiply?"}

But it's a biblical category, right? It comes right out of the New Testament. And you see this, for example, in the perpetual online things where some ecumenist pan heretic will come out and say that Jews and Christians and Muslims all worship the same God. Right? And then, you know, a thousand trads will rise up in anger and say, no, they don't. Right. And point out the differences, the obvious differences that should be obvious between the Jewish and Muslim and Christian views of God, right? To say that those aren't the same view of God. That's not the same God. Right. But what we find in the New Testament coming from both Christ himself and St. Paul is that there's this other category. So Christ is talking to Saint Photini about the Samaritans and what the Samaritans do in Their temple. They didn't actually have the temple, but what they do on Mount Gerizim. Right. In offering sacrifices to God in their minds."}

I don't worry. You know what I mean? On and on and on and on and on. If I get a cut and it gets infected, I don't work well, now I'm dead, right? And my ancestors could not say that, right? And so, because we have this profound sense of our own safety, we see something like a natural disaster as this violent intrusion. So that the question emerges, well, who controls that? Who is sending that natural disaster? Who is sending that danger at us, right? And the reality is that's just one of the things that's still not under our control, about which we don't even have the illusion of control yet. And so it scares us. The real question is, the real question is, what is the source of our actual safety and security in a hostile world? Because contained within, the explanation I just gave, the explanation we give ourselves is that, well, we've taken control of a lot of it. We're safe now because we humans smart and we invent things, right? Until they start running the stories about antibiotic resistant bacteria and we start getting nervous again, right? Because the reason we start getting scared by those stories is because our sense of safety and well being is not coming from God, right? But it's coming from our own ingenuity and our trust in science and our trust in these other things that natural disasters fly in the face of. So the reason I haven't had a heart attack today or been hit by a bus or been in a car accident or had something from a plane fall on me and kill me or gotten a terminal disease or developed a terminal cancer, today, as far as I know, is because of the mercy and grace and goodness of God blessing me.

Yes, I am in the Poor Man's Ohio. My question is about the two wills of Christ. The Ancient Faith recently did a podcast about that, you know, where they interviewed a lot of people from a non Chalcedonian background. And I guess one of the things that confuses me about the whole thing is something that one of the non Chalcedonian speakers said that, you know, a will, kind of like a will is something that a person has, a person does. And so if there are two wills, it kind of sounds like two persons. And I know that's not the case because, I mean, the Lord says, not my will, but thine be done. And he's got so kind of help. I think you've talked about this before, but maybe if you could unpack a little bit more about what we mean when we talk about wills in Christ."}

But it was more generally about the two, you know, whether the two natures. Right. Which is something of a broader category than will. The will issue is subsequent to that and gets worked out in later councils beyond Chalcedon, but obviously it's kind of implied in Chalcedon. So, you know, the natural will. Right. You know, so from, from the point of view of Chalcedonian orthodox, which is what we are, you know, will is. Because I can't. I can't speak for non custodians because I'm not one. Will is natural, so meaning that it's. It has to do with the nature. And that therefore, if you have the nature of a human, then your humanity is moving in the direction of being fully what it is a human should be. The will of a tree is to grow into a tree, for instance. And so Christ being of two natures, being in two natures, fully human, fully divine, at the same time, he has two wills, right? Because if he does not have two wills, then that means that he's not entirely human or he's not entirely divine, whichever will you want to kind of chuck out. The reason why I think that this is a bit confusing for us as modern people is because we tend to think of will as being the choosing faculty, right? Like shall I have ice cream or shall I have baklava? Right. That's how we think of will. I'll have this or that. But that's not the patristic understanding of will, which is much more in line with that. I think it's Aristotle. I don't know if that's correct, Father, but defining will as being sort of a thing coming to be fully what it is, right. Which is why Christ in the garden, he desires not to die because he's human and humans desire not to. You know, their will is not to die. Right. And yet his human will for self preservation is submitted to the divine will for redeeming mankind. Right. It's not that there's this conflict of choosing within Christ, because obviously not. He's not sitting there going, should I do this or should I not? I don't know. Let me think about this for a while longer, right? That's not what's going on. He never. Jesus doesn't waver because he doesn't. His will doesn't do that. Right. He's not fallen, frankly. So I don't know if that helps or if I'm getting anything really wrong here. I mean, I'm not a patristic scholar. This is kind of the seminary level education in Christology that I received."}

Yeah, so, yeah, Aristotle's physics is what. Yeah. Is where you find a good laying out of the idea of the natural will. And so. And it's thelema in Greek. The will is an internal movement which everything has, which moves it towards its telos, towards its end, its purpose, its completion, its perfection."}

An acorn has the same nature as an oak tree, right. But you plant the acorn, the acorn then has this internal movement, right. That moves it forward to grow, to thrive, to take on nourishment, to grow into the oak tree, Right. To come to fullness, sort of. And completion. And so humans Have. And that's called a natural will because it's different based on what nature a thing has, right? So the nature of an oak tree and the nature of a duck are different, right? So you do not have a baby duck that grows into an oak tree. You do not have an acorn that grows into a duck, right? And so that. But so that internal movement is specific to that nature. And so humans also have a human nature, a specific human nature. And the human nature has this internal movement that causes a zygote to become an adult human eventually, if unimpeded, right? To grow to fullness, completion, maturity, right? Perfection. And then that idea of a natural will is applied, as we've talked about before, right? To God, meaning not univocally, right? Because God is different than every created thing in substantive ways, but the energies of God, his activity in creation expresses an internal movement of God outward into creation."}

Little over 10 years ago. Not long ago, I was talking to someone who I've known from that longo time, and I was asked the question, when did you stop believing in salvation by faith and begin by believing in salvation by works?

Yeah, but so here's. Okay, so here's how I would unpack that passage you just mentioned, right? Number one, we are saved by grace. Right? We are saved by grace. So that. That's. That's God. That's God acting. God is the one who saves. We're saved by grace through faithfulness. So faithfulness is the means by which we receive that grace that saves us. Right. And it says that it is the gift of God, meaning that the way of faithfulness, this is how you repent. This is given to us by God. It was not invented by human beings. Okay. And, you know, lest anyone should boast, well, here's the thing. Now, this is not within a Jewish context, within the pagan Greek context, there are people who believe that you could become one of the gods by. By virtue of your great action, you know, like this is totally a thing. You know, Heracles is a classic example of this. He basically now he starts out a demigod, you know, good for you, Heracles. But he achieves his glory, right, by virtue of his great feats. And that's the contrast that St. Paul is making there. He's not talking about, he's talking to the Ephesians, he's not talking about the Torah there. He's talking about, you know, great feats of strength and glory and you know, cleos as they would call it in, in Greek, you know, that sort of everlasting glory, right? So, so yeah, it's God's grace who saves us, which saves us. It's through our faithfulness that we receive it. The only reason we even have the path of faithfulness is because God gave it as a free gift. And following that is not some great accomplishment on our part. We're just doing what God said to do. So that's how you can parse that out from an orthodox point of view."}

They didn't earn the Torah, right? And he makes that very clear, right? He says in Deuteronomy 5, I did not choose you for your own righteousness, for you are a wicked and stiff necked people. That's not why I picked you guys, right? Because you were so great. But to receive the benefits that God promises them, the blessings God promises them in the Torah, they have to keep it. They have to be faithful to it. God gives them a covenant they didn't ask for, they didn't earn, right? But they have to keep it to receive those benefits. And St. Paul does the exact same thing in Romans. While we're still sinners, Christ dies for us as a gift. The way of salvation is established for us as a gift. What do we need to do to receive it? According to St. Paul, just one thing. You be faithful to Christ and then you receive those benefits. And if you're faithless, if you're not faithful, then you won't receive those benefits."}

How should we pray for people in the past? Like, is that effective? Is that worth doing? Like, when I pray, for example, when I pray, St. Timothy is my, my, my saint. So, you know, I pray for him to be a good bishop. And, you know, when I'm asking him to send some, some prayers up for me.

Temporal character, for sure. Right. Within the actual liturgical traditional prayers of the church. And the prayers that you see in scripture, they don't, like, address the past. Right. Like, you know, it's always about the present. And from the point of view of the person praying, it's. It's about the present and the future. Right. So, you know, while I might say, lord have mercy on my children, God through that prayer, may well have been working already, you know, for some time or whatever, but I, I, it would not make sense for me to say, you know, God, please heal my child of that accident that he had last year that he's completely healed from now. You know, it wouldn't make any sense to do that right now if he's still suffering from that accident. It would make sense to say, God, please, you know, relieve that suffering now. Right. And certainly we don't pray for saints, we ask for their prayers. So, yeah, I mean, I think from an orthodox point of view, how should we pray? Is a pretty easily answered question in that we have this huge tradition of liturgical prayer. Right. That doesn't mean that we don't sometimes pray spontaneously in our own words and so forth. But as much as possible, those kinds of prayers should be very much related to the norms of liturgical prayer. How should we pray? We should pray like this, Right. You know, when, when, when Christ himself gave, you know, answered that question, how should you pray? He gave a prayer that we then repeat word for word. Our Father, who art in heaven. Right, yeah. So, you know, those are, those are the norms. And I think it can be a little dangerous to go outside those norms from an orthodox point of view, because, like, there's, it's not like there's anything that our liturgical tradition of prayer doesn't cover. You know, it's so vast. It's so just enormously complex and interesting and poetic and variable and all encompassing, you know.

So I think then the question would be like, how do we unpack exactly what that means? And certainly my understanding of part of what is going on there. I mean, the primary thing that's going on there is he's. He's making our baptism a thing. But I would also say that there is. This is a beginning of his public atoning work. Right. That he's purifying the world through his presence. Because when he touches what is unclean, it becomes clean. Right. Like, Christ doesn't become unclean by touching a dead body or whatever. Instead, what happens is the dead body comes back to life. It becomes not dead. I won't say undead, because that's a different thing. But. But yeah, I mean, I. I definitely believe that there is a sense of cleansing the world from taint that occurs in that. And if you look at, for instance, the. The prayers that are set at theophany. Right. So, you know, just a few months ago. Right."}

Dragons down there crushing the heads of the dragons that lurk in the water. Right, right. Or even. I mean, it's mostly the same prayers, although Kind of a shortened version that you would see at a baptism. Unless a person's getting baptized on theophany or the eve of theophany, which is really awesome. But a long, long morning in church. But ask me how I know."}

It's absolutely awesome. You know, there's still that sense of the banishing demons from the water and, and, you know, crushing the evil spirits and. And all that kind of stuff that is there, you know, stomping on Leviathan, right? Like, that's, that's all within those prayers. And if you can get a copy of like, the. The full prayers of the. The great blessing of water done on Theophany, it is absolutely astonishing to read them. And, and I mean, as a priest, whenever I read them in the service, it is hard for me to not get choked up by just how just moving they are and how just awesome is the right word. And I don't mean awesome like that's totally awesome, like we used to say in the 80s, but truly awesome, like it causes awe because it really does. It is an awesome thing. Yeah, Father, I mean, is. Is Christ's baptism, is it doing something cosmic too?"}

That atonement actually is that purification of the world from the stain of sin. And this is how Saint Athanasius understands that in the Incarnation, God touches every part of humanity and therefore atones for every part of humanity, purifies every part of humanity, right through the Incarnation. And because Christ shares our human nature, he is doing that to human nature."}
