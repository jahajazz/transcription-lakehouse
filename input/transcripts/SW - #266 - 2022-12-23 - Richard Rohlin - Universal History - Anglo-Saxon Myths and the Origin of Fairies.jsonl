So we're gonna talk about the Anglo Saxons today. And as many people know, I'm a Germanic philologist. That's really. You could say that was like, my door into Medieval studies. You know, I've always been interested in the Middle Ages, but even as a kid. But my real door into Medieval studies as a scholar was through Germanic philology and specifically Anglo Saxon and Old Norse literature and languages. So we're gonna start by talking about. It'd probably be the first of a couple of conversations about the Old north and universal history and the way that the Christians of the Late Germanic Iron Age. The Germanic Iron Age is a period. Some people. Well, there are different dates assigned to it, but I think most people have it from about 500 BC, maybe a little bit later, up to 800 AD so the late Germanic Iron Age, this and beyond, is the period in which the various Northern Germanic peoples begin to convert to Christianity. And it's the. Basically, it's the period immediately before the Viking Age, though we will get into some Viking age stuff as well. So probably not today, but in the future. So what I wanted to talk about was actually, let's just pick up again with the. The Apocalypse of Pseudo Methodius. It seems like this is a text that we just come back to constantly over and over again. And it really is a central text to the way that these cultures understood universal history. And one of the important things to note about this text, and something we brought up a couple of times before, is that in the Apocalypse of Pseudo Methodius, we find a witness of this tradition that there was a fourth son of Noah. Now, I think that in the Apocalypse of Pseudo Methodius, he's named something like Jonathos or. I think that's right."}

Okay, so that's. I mean, that's the question. That's actually the big spicy question about him. And this goes back to the Apocalypse of Pseudo Methodius is relying for this on a much earlier Syriac work called the Cave of Treasures, in case anybody's wondering. And there's a pretty good. I think Sebastian Brock did a pretty good translation of that. So you can go read that. And Scott, just like a bunch of the early Christian, late Jewish traditions that were preserved in Syrian concerning Adam and Eve and the Garden of Eden and all this stuff. And if you wanted to get a better framework for reading Seida from the Syrian, that's a pretty good place to start. So this is the question. When was he born? Where was he born? Some ancient authors and medieval authors have him being born on the ark, Others have him being born after the ark, because the Genesis text is actually fairly explicit about who exited the ark. Right. And so then it's like, well, but, you know, maybe he was a little baby. So just in case people don't know There is a strong tradition in a lot of ancient texts, especially in Syrian, that when. So Noah has these three sons and then when God tells him that he's going to destroy the earth with a flood, Noah lives as celibate until the flood."}

Yeah. This is a pretty well attested tradition. Okay. So the idea is that he lives as celibate until the flood, and then on the ark with his wife, he conceives this fourth son and he's either born on the ark or he's born after they disembark, kind of depending. I mean the sort of like the math. If he's conceived on the ark, the math doesn't really work for him to have been born on there necessarily. But you know, these are. This is long ago in far off times. So, you know, mathematical considerations, not the most important thing."}

Yeah. Yeah. So. So, yeah. And you could think about the symbolism of that in itself. The idea that Noah lived as celibate when he was building the ark. Yeah.

A holy place, you know, in chaos. You know, there's all these, there's different types. The ark has all kinds of associations, but that those associations are definitely there. You see some medieval representations of the ark as a seed. If you've ever seen it, it looks like a, like kind of like a sort of almond shaped or something like an almond shape. So."}

You're right, that's a very good point. So there's this very ancient association between flooding and menstruation. Yeah. Which, you know, if you've read Matthieu's book, is very easy to understand. It makes sense. But there are also like certain taboos about reproduction during, during menstruation, things like that. The point of all of this is the fact that this fourth son may have been conceived on the ark. Yeah."}

We're getting into really weird territory here, but it's okay. But we also. Let's say new beginnings are born out of exceptional things."}
{"episode_id":"SW - #266 - 2022-12-23 - Richard Rohlin - Universal History - Anglo-Saxon Myths and the Origin of Fairies","start":475.95,"end":564.57,"speaker":"Richard Rohlin","text":"And so, yeah, that's. That's what I'm trying to get to. And you can even, like, see this in the way, like, the sending the raven out, sending the dove out, the sea, the branch, all that stuff. Right. It's new life being born out of this, like, really exceptional kind of a space. And so this fourth son of Noah, who in Greek and Syrian text is usually like yon ton or Yoniton or Jonitus, I think, in Latin, although I think there's also a Georgian version that's like bonitor or something like that. But anyway, this character, this figure of the fourth son, the point is that he's born out of this kind of weird, liminal, marginal space, and he functions in that way in more than one way. For instance, first of all, he isn't actually in the canonical text of scripture. I wouldn't say it's a minority tradition. It's an obscure tradition today, but everyone in the Middle Ages knew about this. But it's definitely an apocryphal tradition in the sense of apocryphal being something that's hidden. And if people don't remember in the apocalypse of Pseudo Methodius, the role that he has is that he goes off far to the east, which seems like the wrong direction for the stuff we're gonna be talking about today, but he goes off far to the east, to the land of the rising sun is actually what it says. And there he is taught sort of esoteric wisdom from God. And eventually, like, Nimrod goes off and travels, and he's. He's the one that Nimrod learns, like, divination and astronomy and things like this from."}

In the Cave of Wonders, like in the Syrian text. Yeah. And of course, this is problematic because Nimrod also introduces the worship of fire. Right. He finds this fire ascending from the earth, so the light coming from below as opposed to the light coming from above. And he goes down to where the light is coming from, and a voice speaks to him out of the fire, and he worships it. And this is sort of like a Syrian. You know, there's a bit of, like, a polemic against their Persian neighbors here, Right. Zoroastrianism, the worship of fire. But anyway, so eventually, Yeonton tells him, you know, don't come back. You know, teaches him some. Some Stuff. But then he kind of sees the direction Nimrod is heading and he tells him, don't come back. So anyway, he's this interesting figure, and he's really associated, you know, back when we were talking about India and the Far east, he's associated ultimately with the idea of, like, the Eastern. Of Eastern wisdom, the Eastern philosopher, the gymnasophist. All that stuff goes back to. Goes back to this fourth set of Noah. So the weird thing is that there is actually there are a large number of connections which we are really just coming to understand. When I say we, I mean, like the scholarly community at large, people who study Old English culture, Germanic studies, et cetera. There are a large number of connections between what you could call the Old Testament pseudoepigrapha, like the legit apocrypha. When I say apocrypha, I don't mean like Tobit or Maccabees or Judith or something like that. That's just the director's cut of the Bible. But when I. So when I say apocrypha, I mean, like, really apocryphal stuff. Like, you know, the Book of Enoch would. The Book of Enoch is a good example. Yeah. Or the Life, unless you're Ethiopian, obviously, but the Book of Enoch, the life of Adam and Eve, stuff like that. So there is a huge connection between this apocryphal literature, the Syrian tradition, which was probably the means of conveyance for a lot of these things, and Anglo Saxon Christianity, which is again, a very surprising kind of thing. And I think that's part of why it's taken us so long to notice, because in the past, traditionally, academia has been very siloed. So if you were somebody studying Syriac or Ethiopian, you were probably not somebody who was also studying, you know, Beowulf."}

But this is even before that. This connection goes back even before that. And in this case, we actually have a name, a face, a date that we can probably peg the connection to. So it comes through a couple of routes. One is that there was a huge treasury of these pseudoepigraphal texts, usually translated first into Latin and then into Old Irish, that were kept in these Irish monasteries. And so people who know the story of the conversion of the Anglo Saxons, it really happened from two directions. There was a Roman push for conversion kind of from the south and then at the same time, there was an Irish push for conversion from the north. And eventually the two sort of met in the middle, and they had some synods, and it's a whole thing. But these Irish monasteries, unfortunately, most of the manuscripts they had were destroyed by Vikings during the Viking age. But these Irish monasteries had extensive collections of these pseudoepigraphal texts. For instance, there is an Old Irish. It's called the Saltair. Narayn probably said that wrong because it's Old Irish, and my brain does not do Gaelic languages. So anyway, all the Gaelic, like the old. The old Irish speakers out there, you have to just forgive me. But the psalter Narain, which literally just means like the psalter of a quatrains, is a collection of about a hundred. I think it's Exactly. No, it's 150, because it's a Psalter. So it's got 150 poems in it. It's a collection of 150 Psalms or quatrains, these poems that have. The basic stanza is four lines, and basically it's the ent. Old Irish universal history of the world, starting with Adam and Eve and the creation of the world and going forward through time. And if you go read the Salt Terre Narain, what they basically do is they take all of this. All of the pseudepigraphal stuff, and they take the early chapters of Genesis and they take, you know, the rest of the historical books of the Scriptures and the Gospels and all these things, and they just weave it together into a cohesive account. And I just want to emphasize this was a book that was made for laypeople. It's not written in Latin. It was written in Old Irish, because the point of it was that it would be easy way to sort of teach people the. I don't want to say teach people their Bible, but teach people the tradition. Like, teach, like, pass on. Pass on. What do we as Christians believe about where we came from, the origins of humanity? Where did demons and angels and fairies and all this stuff? And so you can go look at this. And I don't think the whole thing has been translated into English, but good bits of it have. There might be. There might be a whole translation into English that's like, really archaic, I think, maybe back in the 1800s."}

I was at Doxicon in October, November, and there were some symbolic world folks there, which is great. We got a picture together and it was great to see all. But at Doxicon, somebody gave this beautiful talk and it was just on, you know, 19th century firsthand accounts of people who met fairies. And the fairies were asking, can we be saved? Right. That was the question. And the general consensus in all of these stories seems to sort of be. That's a question that cannot be known until the Day of Judgment. But anyway, yeah, like, you start getting to the fairy thing, it's really interesting. But basically, in the Middle Ages, there are two or three main theories of what fairies are and where they come from. And the first one of those, and this is also found in rabbinic literature, is that they are the unwashed children of Eve. This idea that God or the Archangel Michael, depending on the story, comes to bless Eve and her children. It's after the fall, but it's like washing day, and not all the kids are clean. And so she puts the dirty ones behind her back and they don't get the blessing. And so the ones that are blessed are the ones from which humanity is descended. And the ones that didn't get the blessing, they're the ones that fairies are descended from. So they're sort of like, kind of like, well, fairies and djinn and like, you know, all the. All the, you know, these different. Yeah, these ambiguous, intermediary, ambiguous kind of spirits. So that's one theory. Another theory, and I think this is the one that you find in the Solitaire in the Rain, is that fairies are the descendants of angels who took a neutral stance during the war in heaven. So during the war. Oh, really? Oh, you didn't know this?"}

So this is. Is probably, in the Middle Ages, is probably the most common theory for where fairies come from. So the basic idea is that they were angels who took. Took a neutral position in the war in heaven, and they didn't fight against Lucifer, but they also didn't fight on the side of God. So they're. They're cast out, but they're not cast all the way down. So whereas Lucifer, the devil and his angels are cast down to hell, these guys are cast sort of halfway down to earth and they become these sort of like, very earthy spirits. And so they're like these Spirits of."}

And I think that that ties back to a much older kind of original source for both of those traditions. Yeah. And by the way, I'll just put, like a little plug. You won't actually get it in this book, but you'll find it in the next one that's going to come out this next year in my own sort of fantasy legendarium. This is the origin that I use for. They're not called fairies in this story, but the. Essentially the fairies that the main culture, the emporian culture in my fantasy story, they're descended from. But one of the things that I try to sort of suss out in my own reworking of that myth is, well, why did they take this neutral position and try to answer that question? So if you want my personal take on that, you can read till sometime next year. Yeah, that book will come out. But anyway, so then the third theory of kind of where fairies come from is essentially that they're the Nephilim."}

And so with the Nephilim understood as either the descendants of Cain or the descendants of the sons of God, daughters of men, it just depends on, like, how do you read that sons of God, daughters of men thing, even in the Syriac sources, like, for instance, St. Ephraim is a very early witness to, like, that sort of Sethite hypothesis, whereas there are other, other very early texts, such as the Book of Enoch, which have it as this coupling of angels and humans. And we've talked before about why these are not really in the Middle Ages, especially by the authors of things like the Beowulf poem. These are not necessarily viewed as mutually exclusive positions because. Well, for one thing, either way. Either way that you read it, there's this unholy pairing at these movement down the mountain, at these levels of the ontological hierarchy. And the line of Cain is always involved somehow, either the light."}

So for me, it's not people are like, oh, but doesn't this person Say this. And doesn't this person say this? And, you know, it's. Since we're just doing tangents today, so there's a little bit for. For some other studies that I've been doing. I've been reading a lot of Saint Cyril of Alexandria lately, and he has this wonderful sort of polemic piece called Against Julian. Right. So this is a piece that he writes against Julian the apostate. And one of the things that he does is he excerpts significant portions of Julian the Apostates against the Galileans, which is his sort of tirade against Christianity. And it's really the. I think it's the only extant place that we actually have that now is excerpted within Saint Cyril. But in Julian's writings, he's giving all of these arguments against the Virgin birth, which he finds. I mean, Julian is. I don't. I don't know how to say this nicely."}

Here's the thing. Julian has, like, a bunch of very Protestant objections to Christianity. Like, and again, I'm not trying to, like, at my Protestant friends or family or whatever, but like Julian the Apostate, if you read his actual complaints against Christianity, he can't stand the fact that we're kissing relics. He can't stand the fact that we think the Eucharist is the body and blood, blood of Christ. He can't stand the fact that we call Mary the Theotokos. This is literally. This is one of his main arguments against Christianity is he says it's insane to call a human woman the mother of God. You can't do that. Right. So he's actually like an early witness to a couple of things. One is that at this very early stage, Theotokos was a title everybody had already been using for a long time. But one of the arguments he makes against calling Mary the Theotokos is he says, okay, okay, okay. If you really believe it went down this way, then that makes Jesus one of the Nephilim. Right, right. Which is wrong and not the point, just to be clear, but it's also an early witness to the fact that Julian, who we have to remember, basically went to seminary with the Cappadocian Fathers, or he went to the academy in Athens with St. Basil the Great and Gregory the Theologian. Right. And this was his understanding. In other words, this is how he'd been taught the Scriptures, was that this is how to read Genesis, Chapter six."}

So this is the third version that you find in the Middle Ages of sort of like the origins for like, where do fairies come from? And by fairies I mean giants, monsters, et cetera. So. And this is, for instance, the version that you find in Beowulf, which we'll talk about a little more in a minute. But in this case, to kind of rewind all the way back, there's this very strong witness to the Old Testament pseudoepigrapha and the Syrian tradition within Anglo Saxon literature. And it's only just now starting to be better understood. But most of this probably goes back to a guy named Saint Theodore of Tarsus. Do you know about Saint Theodore of Tarsus? He's one of the earliest archbishops of Canterbury. He was Archbishop starting in 668. So this is very shortly after the Anglo Saxon conversion. And he was born in Tarsus, he grew up in Constantinople. He visited Edessa. He spoke and read Syrian fluently. And by sort of a series of historical accidents, whatever you want to call it, he first goes west to Rome, where he lives at an Eastern monastery in Rome. And at this time, this is when he learns Latin. And then after the Synod of Whitby is held in 664, he is sent to Canterbury because they need a new archbishop. And so they send him there and he goes there and there are sort of stories of his erecting what is either the first rood screen or just an iconostasis in a church there in England. And anyway, all this stuff. So he's a really interesting figure. And if you look at him, I mean, he was totally steeped in the Byzantine theological tradition, completely steeped in Assyrian theological tradition. Kind of somebody who went to every great center of Christianity in the east, except for maybe northern Africa, and was able to acquire the learning, acquire the languages. And so he brings with him. And at Canterbury, he founds a school called the School of Canterbury. And there's lots evidence to suggest, if you kind of look at the chronicles and also the list of books. So sometimes we don't have surviving books, but we have surviving book lists from the School of Canterbury, we see that things like the Apocalypse of Pseudo Methodius are listed among books that they had access to, so they were definitely aware of these traditions. There's a really great book which I have just over there, but the spine is facing away from me, so I can't see the name of it right now. But it's something like the Apocrypha in the Anglo Saxon homiletic tradition. Something like that. And basically, it does a great job of looking at sermons, books of homilies. So in the Middle Ages, people were not typically expected, especially when you had varying levels of learning. And sometimes your village priest wasn't, you know, maybe the most articulate guy. That's fine. We just need him to do the liturgy. Right. But because you had these varying levels of learning in the Middle Ages, it was not necessarily expected that your priest would always just be able to give, like, a banger of a homily."}

And so it's very common to have books of homilies, usually called homilies. And these homilies would be arranged based on the liturgical year and the lectionary readings and things like this. So they were copied a lot, which means they're more likely to survive. And also, they are really important witnesses. So we can look at them to figure out things like. Well, we know that the absolute latest date that this feast started being celebrated in this region was, you know, in this century. It could have been before that, but it certainly, you know, certainly was after that. Yeah. And so. Or absolute earliest date, anyway, all that to say. So they're really important, really important witnesses for lots of different things. And I'm really interested in them, A, for the actual content, which is. Which is usually pretty awesome, you know, and then B, because they are a good gauge of what is being taught to lay people. Right. And so it's like, one thing to say that this stuff is present in a. You know, it's in a library, it's somewhere where monks have access to it, et cetera, et cetera. Okay. But what. What did the average Anglo Saxon peasant, commoner, whatever, what did they think about the world? And if you go look at my homilies, you can just see, here are the things that are being taught. And so if you. If you start looking through the Anglo Saxon homiletic tradition, you find all kinds of wonderful things. And one of the things that you find is that they were taking the Old Testament pseudepigrapha for instance, the Life of Adam and Eve, the visio Pali, the vision of St. Paul, or the Apocalypse of St. Paul, as it's sometimes called, the Life of Peter and Paul, all these other important kind of apocryphal or pseudoepigraphal works. And they were actually incorporating them into their homilies to lay people to help them understand things about the afterlife. I mean, the visio poly is one of the earliest. Let me put it this way, there's no Dante's Inferno without the visio poly. Right. It's one of the earliest descriptions that we have, although it probably relies on the Ezra literature, like the second and third ESDRAs and things like that. But it's one of the earliest witnesses we have, to kind of this tradition of the torments of hell and this idea, let the punishment fit the crime, stuff like that. One of my favorite things in there, and I think this is in third ESDRAs as well, is the idea that Herod is forever imprisoned in hell, sitting on a burning throne. And so it's one. Because he misused his kingship. But there's also kind of a subtext there that sort of suggests. How do I say this delicately, a connection between that and childbirth because of all the children that he killed. And so, you know, things like this. Anyway, it's all pretty grim stuff, but very interesting reading. It's also important for Anglo Saxon studies because it's actually quoted and in some places, and paraphrase in others. In the Beowulf poem, when they tried to describe the marsh where Grendel's mother lives, which is this very. I mean, it's literally, it's hell, right? This place where these monsters live, this, you know, kind of haunted swamp or mere. They go back and they use a bunch of this stuff from these homilies that are normally descriptions of the torments of hell, and they use it to describe this location. And so there's. There's other stuff in there. Deliberate connections throughout Beowulf between Sigurd the slayer of the. I want to say, is it Sigurd or Sigmund now? I think it's Sigmund, because when the Beowulf poet wrote his poem, Sigmund was the famous dragon slayer, and then later on it's his son Sigurd. I might have that. I think that's right. But basically, they take the most famous Germanic dragon slayer and then use language from his story, and then they take language from the story of St. Michael casting Satan out of heaven, and language from his story. And they incorporate both of that into the story of Beowulf killing monsters. And so it's like, let's tie our hero, who is a hero set in pre Christian times, but it's a story being put together by a Christian. And so let's take the most famous pagan dragon slayer and the most famous Christian dragon slayer, you could say, and incorporate them both into our hero. So to me, this is what makes the Beowulf poem so interesting, is the way that it, you know, it's certainly compiled by or written by a Christian, probably a monk, probably in the early seven hundreds. At some point we'll talk more about Beowulf. But what that monk is, he's taking these older stories not just from, like, Germanic paganism, but also from the sort of biblical Apocrypha, like the apocryphal tradition. He's taking both of those stories and integrated them. So in the Beowulf poem, for instance, you get this idea of Sheaf or Shaiaf or Shaiafa, depending on how you want to say his name and where you're from back then. And this character, although this gets a little complicated because the Beowulf poet, who is our earliest witness, like earliest written witness to this character, he actually combines him with an old pagan character. So we've got this tradition of a fourth son of Noah. There's also this tradition of a guy named Scyld, which literally just means shield, who is the mythical progenitor of the Danish kings. He's the Danish equivalent of, like, King Arthur. And the Beowulf poet takes those two characters and he combines them into a single character called Shield shaving. Right. A shield son of Sheaf is what that literally means. But the Sheaf myth, or the Sheaf legend, is about this young boy who washes up on the shores of Western Europe, back far, far away, long ago, in the mists of time, washes up on the shores of Northern Europe, and he's shining, he's beautiful, his skin is literally glowing, which is, by the way, how Noah is described. When he's born in third Enoch and there's nobody with him, he just washes up on shore, and he's lying in the boat and he's got his head resting on a sheaf of wheat, which is why he's called Sheave. And the people take him and they take him back up to the hall, and their king has recently died, and they don't have a new king. And so they take this boy and they make him king. And he basically brings. He's a culture hero. He brings what is 19th century scholars refer to this kind of figure as a corn king. Right. Somebody who brings the secrets of agriculture and how to grow crops and things like that. He brings them to the Scandinavian people. So he's this weird legendary figure that's on a certain level, well attested, but at the same time not where we don't really know much about him. And what seems to be happening specifically during the time of Alfred the Great is that they take Sheev, which is probably this pre existing sort of Germanic legend, which nobody really knows when it started or where it started or how to explain it. They take Sheev. And you'll find this, for instance, in the Anglo Saxon Chronicle, which is written during Alfred's life. Alfred. For people who don't know Alfred the Great, in addition to making the Danes behave themselves, Alfred the Great oversaw a tremendous program of, you could say, literary renewal and revival in Anglo Saxon England. And he's responsible for just a tremendous amount of most of the best Anglo Saxon literature comes from, was at least preserved, written down, preserved, collected, et cetera, by scholars working for him. He also did quite a bit of translation himself. He translated St. Gregory the Great's Pastoral Care and then he also translated the Boethius, the Consolation of Philosophy. Although when I say he translated it, he translated it the way people translated things in the Middle Ages, which is as you're translating, if you think of a way to improve this, well, just go right ahead, you know, and actually, yeah, I kind of like Alfred's better. No offense to Boethius. Well, okay, so here's the thing about Alfred's Boethius is that a lot of people say, oh, well, Alfred was like, because he's this Christian and he's anti paganism, all this thing. He actually, he actually removes all of the pagan remarks and all the pagan references and things like that of Boethius. And when people say this, I just, I always assume they have not actually read it because Alfred does not remove the references to paganism, although he changes them sometimes to make them make more sense to his audience, but he actually significantly enlarges them. So for instance, there's a very brief reference and this is actually all connected. I swear. There's a brief reference in Boethius, you know, when it's talking about, you know, hubris and people who thought they were doing great and then turned out, you know, things change for them. Right. Which is one of the main focus of the consolation. Right. So he, as example, he lists the titans of old. Right. Well, Alfred says, now, some people here might refer an example to the titans of myth, but you and I know perfectly well that the titans of myth are actually the giants of Genesis. And he goes into this whole long thing about Nimrod and how Nimrod was a giant and all this stuff. So, like, he keeps the reference, but he. He's not Christianizing it in the sense of sanitizing it. He's just saying, ah, but if you really knew about Genesis and the Anglo Saxons were obsessed with Genesis and Exodus specifically, if you really knew about Genesis and you knew about this other literature, these other stories, you would know that the titans of myth are actually the giants of Genesis. Chapter six."}

And they do this because it allows them to connect their lineage. So one of the earliest places that we see this being done in writing is in the Anglo Saxon Chronicle, there is a genealogy of Alfred's father. And in the genealogy of Alfred's father, which I have, I have right here. So his father, Athelwulf, Great name, by the way. Anybody out there looking to name a son at the wolf? Very strong name.

Beow the son of Sheldois, Sheldoi of Heromod, Hemod of Itermon, Itermon of Chadra, Hadra of Hala of Bedwig, Bedwig of Shaf, that is the son of Noah who was born on Noah's Ark.

You know, but the thing that he's looking to do is really trace his lineage back to Noah and of course, ultimately back to Christ or, sorry, back to Adam. Well, and Christ, because he says, you know, who's born on Noah's Ark, who's the son of Laznak, the son of Methuselah, the son of Enoch, the son of Jared, the son of Malachiel, the son of Canaan, the son of Enos, the son of Seth, the son of Adam, the first man and our Father, that is Christ. Amen. So, and this is. I mean, that's a deliberate reference back to the gospel according to St. Luke. Right.

And that he sort of, by that, that, you know, by this recapitulation, he becomes the new Adam, he becomes the new head, and then everyone is gathered back under him again. This genealogy is deliberately echoing that. Right. It's deliberately echoing this to show where do the Anglo Saxons fit in sort of the vast scheme of everything, and ultimately where do they fit in the story of redemption? Where do they fit in the Christian household? And what's really weird is that they go this route because literally everyone else, if you look at Welsh chronicles, if you look at French chronicles, if you look at German chronicles on the continent, literally everyone else just traces themselves back to Japheth, which is what any European would do in the Middle Ages. But the Anglo Saxons, and then ultimately following them, the Scandinavians, once they convert, they, they're not converted. They haven't converted at this point, but they convert. And when they convert, they basically learn Christianity from the Anglo Saxons. So everyone else at this time just traces their lineage back to Japheth. But for the Anglo Saxons, it's really important to trace themselves back to this fourth son of Noah, very self consciously so. And they do it without. I mean, they change his name. Like, you can't get from, you know, Yonton to Sheaf. Like it can't do it, it doesn't work. They change his name. They, they ignore basically all of the, the things that you'd find in, like, Eastern traditions about him. You know, as far as, you know, there's no association with Nimrod here. Alfred, actually, really, how do I say this? The Northern Germanic people, they had their own memory, right? They had their own memory of the war of God with the giants. This is one of the major background pieces of the Beowulf poem, right? Is this. It's one of the major things that everybody kind of remembers happened. And of course it's because they had it in their own myths and legends. And then Christianity came along, Christianity had it too. So here's where I will say something really cool and then we'll just save it for next time to explain. There is every reason to believe that the Beowulf poet had access to the Book of Enoch, or at least had access to strong Enochian traditions. In fact, I'll just say this wildly and befuddle everyone, including my fellow Anglo Saxonists. There is a very strong case to be made that Grendel's name actually comesat least part of Grendel's name comes from the Book of Enoch. So I'll just throw that one out there and let people percolate on it. Actually, if you're not an Anglo Saxonist, that may not be a very big deal to you. But if I am, you're going to. If you are, you're going to be like, like, what the heck did he just say? So I'll defend."}

There's definitely paganism in there, but it's such a perfect weaving together of things that it's almost impossible to disentangle it. But I really, honestly, I believe that if you want to.

But then here's the same text in a language you do know, right? Beowulf is the Rosetta Stone for all of this stuff. It's where, especially in the Old north, all of the stuff comes together in the Beowulf poem. And if you dig around very closely, I'll just throw out kind of one little example, right? When Scyld Shaving, he's shown washing up on the shore of the Danish coast, and the Danes take him in, they make him king. After he dies, they hold a big funeral for him. There are three funerals in Beowulf. One at the beginning, one in the middle, one at the end. Very important to the story. But they hold this big funeral for Shield shaving. And when they do, they give him a ship burial. But it's not like the one in the movie where they push the ship out and, like, shoot the arrow or whatever. They put him back in the ship. They laid. They put a bunch of treasure on the ship with him, and then they push the ship out into the sea. And what it says is they send him back to those who had sent him. And earlier on, they keep saying that God sent him to the Danish people. God sent him to the Danish people because they'd had a bad king before, and then now they don't have a king at all. And so God sent him. God sent him. God sent him. But when they push the ship out, it says, send him back to those plural who had sent him. The question is, who sent Shield shaving? To the Danish people in the Beowulf poem. If you've got this kind of weird 19th century German version of Christianity where it's so rigidly monotheistic that you don't even have room to think about the saints, the divine council, angelic orders, these different things, then it doesn't make any sense. And you'd have to. And so they would look at that and they would say, aha, Christianity doesn't have a them. Yeah. And so that's got to be a piece of paganism. That's got to be like. Like the poet was just incautious. But actually, the Beowulf poet is, I think, one of the most cautious writers who's ever lived in terms of. I mean, he's very artistic. And the idea that he would just make a mistake like that is, I think, utter nonsense. It's a much better case to say that. Well, actually, this probably 8th century monk, there's a lot of debate actually about the dating of the Beowulf poem. The manuscript that we have isn't the original, it's a copy. It's from much later than when it was composed. So there's kind of this argument about when was it composed? And when I say there's an argument. There was a very famous conference held in Toronto, the University of Toronto, called the Dating of Beowulf and an actual fist fight. I've talked to people who were there. An actual fist fight broke out at the conference over this stuff."}

Based on our better understanding of certain metrical laws in Anglo Saxon literature and things like this, the consensus is kind of swinging back towards that earlier date again. Anyway, I'm an early date of Beowulf guy. If you're not, I don't care. But anyway."}

And that in some ways, you know, the fact that we could see fairies appear in. In Great Britain and, you know, that there was this whole structure there. And I thought, how do they account for that? Because it does look like the notion of the jinn or these. These neutral or ambiguous figures, at least that can sometimes be tricky because they can go either way. Like, it's not that they. They can be neutral or they can go either way. And so this is great that they actually have this actual tradition. And I think that. I mean, this. People will wonder, why does Jonathan care so much about this? And the reason why he cares so much about this is that if we talk about the notion that there are principalities or their agencies which are above the human consciousness, or that gather human consciousnesses together and gather phenomena together, let's say, then the idea that it's only either from heaven or hell, that it's only good or bad, is not the one we experience. We experience agency on us that doesn't necessarily have those two polarities. And so the problem is, if we experience that, then how do we account for it in our own symbolic structure? How can we talk about it both in technical terms, that's easier. But to talk about it with a more mythological language, I found harder to do because is. It's tricky. And I see, like, I saw CS Lewis obviously playing around with this. You see people playing around with this notion, but not. Not explicating it in a way that I found, like, gratifying."}

Exactly what you're saying. Yeah, this stuff is in St. Isaac the Syrian. He talks about, like, the old gods. And obviously he doesn't use the word fairies, but one of his homilies, he talks about this and this idea that for him there is a limit that is placed on how much certain principalities and powers are allowed to lie. Something like that. He's got some really interesting stuff on this. I will see if I can dig that homily up and send you a text."}

But, yeah, so this stuff maybe to kind of wrap it up here, because I think we're getting close to the time that we like to do these, so to kind of sum all this up, the Anglo Saxon Christians made very free use of the biblical pseudo epigrapha and of the. Or, you know, what you could call the apocrypha, as well as Syrian traditions, Right. They had access to these very important early works of universal history. And so when they attempt to write their own works of universal history, which is, by the way, that's what the Anglo Saxon Chronicle is. People only study it now for, like, you know, you know, wars and things like this. But, you know, the Anglo Saxon Chronicle starts at, you know, starts with creation. Yeah, right. You know, it starts with. Or at least it starts back at. It doesn't start with creation, it starts with the birth of Christ. Right. But it's. I mean, think about that decision alone to say, we're. We're the English people, not British, we're the English people, and we're going to start our history. This is our chronicle. And the history of the English people starts with. Before the incarnation of Christ, 60 years, Gaius Julius, the Emperor, the first of the Romans, sought the land of Britain and crushed the Britons in battle and overcame them. Nevertheless, he was unable to gain any empire there. And then Octavius reigned 56 winters, and in the 42nd year of his reign, Christ was born. That's the opening, kind of the opening entry, more or less, in the Anglo Saxon Chronicle. So it's a work of universal history, because what they're saying is our history actually begins with the birth of Christ and it begins with Rome. So what I'd like to talk about next time is why don't we just zoom in on Beowulf?"}

Well, we'll do an episode on Beowulf and I have some other crazy ideas that I came up with today regarding Beowulf and the symbolic world. So we'll talk about that later and maybe see what you think about that and see what everybody else thinks about it. And then after that, what I'd like to do is kind of pick up again after Beowulf and look at. So there are three things. So we said before in universal History that the universal history project is really. You have to tie yourself back to Noah, right, Or the. The Old Testament. You have to tie yourself back to the Christian story, and then you also tie yourself back to the Roman story, right? Well, the North Germanic pagans, as they convert, they are going to do a third thing, right, which is try to tie themselves back to Noah, tie themselves back to Rome, and then tie themselves back to all of their own, like gods, heroes, ancestors, and try to figure out where do they fit in the story."}

You know, the, the, the Britons, the Gaelic people had lost a lot of their spiritual leadership anyways by the time, like Julius Caesar brags about how many druids he slaughtered. Like, by the time that they convert to Christianity, I don't know how much was left even of their own tradition. Whereas the, the northern people had this very strong memory of their. Their own chronicles."}
