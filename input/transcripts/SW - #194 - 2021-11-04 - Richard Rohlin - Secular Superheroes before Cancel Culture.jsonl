We are back with Richard Rowland. I know everybody is excited to see. What is it that we're going to talk about today? After our trek through Ethiopia, we are now moving back to Western Europe. What we're going to do is we're going to. We've been talking a lot about sacred history and about how these religious patterns kind of manifested themselves in the way that people understood themselves and their identities. But now we're going to look a little more at the secular world and we're going to look at a tradition called the Nine Worthies, where even in secular spaces or in kind of more common spaces, there was this desire to connect their own society, through memory, through celebration, with different characters in the past, both from the pagan world and the Christian religious world, trying to kind of continue on this vision of universal history that we've been proposing since the beginning. This is Jonathan Peugeot. Welcome to the Symbolic World. And so, Richard, I know there were a few things you wanted to say. Before we start. There are a few things you wanted to kind of come back on. First of all, congratulations on the conference, on the Tolkien conference that you went to. I hear some people where my Symbolic world people were there."}

Just a bunch of really delightful people. We had a bunch of people for whom this was their first time ever stepping into an Orthodox church, which was really awesome and I think was made a really big impression on people. We had a cool time. The talks, which I think will be very resonant for your audience, will be up on the Emma School podcast whenever they get uploaded by our audio producer. We did some other really cool stuff. We got to read the Dream of the Rood, which is an Anglo Saxon devotional poem to the Lord's Cross, actually in front of a relic of the Lord's Cross and venerate that relic, which was basically. It was just sort of like peak my life. It was just sort of one of the best things that ever happened. Yeah, well, everything coming together."}

Is going to look over some few precisions we need to make maybe."}

So, Thaddeus, thanks for. Thanks for reaching out. And I have to say one of my favorite things in life is actually being graciously corrected. I say graciously, okay. But I really do try to keep a sort of beginner's mind about these things. And there's definitely stuff that I was picking up by, you know, from reading different books and different academic papers and things like that, but I don't have that same insider perspective. So Taddeos reached out to correct a few things that we said that I said in our last Ethiopia video about Ethiopian saints and hagiography. And I just wanted to go over them real quick because they're actually super cool and they actually make the overall point that we were trying to make better than the things that we said. So his first thing that he wanted to mention was the. I said something about one of the saints whose leg sort of fell off. And my impression, and this was based on an academic paper that I'd read on the subject, my impression was that the leg was not actually a big deal and it wasn't really venerated. And I mentioned this mostly because it seemed weird and very like, A, not what Christians do, but also B, very kind of non Ethiopian."}

So his legs would kind of come up and Seven years he prayed only standing on. Seven of those years he prayed only standing on one foot. And so what he had done, of course we have, like, stylites and people like this. So to stop him from seating or leaning to the side, it says that he put six, like, arrows or spears on either side of them so that if he got tired and leaned to one side, he'd be pierced by them. And Tradition describes that whenever his body got weaker and he leaned to the side, the arrows would pierce him and keep him stranding, standing straight for years, praying in this cave. And so this led to one of his legs below the knee getting broken off from his body, like you'd imagine might happen. And he said, apparently that particular bone, not only was it kept, but it actually has its own feast day on the Ethiopian calendar just for that leg, which is pretty awesome. I love stuff like this. Like we have, we have like the, like two different feasts around the head."}

And actually one of the cool things he did include a picture of an icon of this particular saint. And of course, the first thing that I noticed in the icon was just the fact that the saint has six wings. You know, he's a seraphim. Yeah. And so something about like his burning intensity, his love for God. So anyway, that was really cool. There was, there were some other corrections in here. I mean, some of these stories were. Are just like crazy. I'll read what he says about this. He said there are sub traditions within the tradition of, you know, the veneration of a saint's relic. So for instance, there's a famous monastery called St. Melchizedek, who is a saint named after the Old Testament priest. God gave him this covenant which makes everyone who is buried near the monastery, not just the saints, makes their relics be preserved as incorrupt so that they don't decay. And he says, and I'm just going to go off of what he says here. I haven't looked this up at all. This is last I've heard, some university professors tried to test the hypothesis on the hagiography and bury someone half like their body, like half in, half outside the borders of a monastery. And the portion of the body that was inside the monastery premise didn't decay and the other portion did like every other burial. And he doesn't actually include some pictures here. And there's some other really crazy stuff of like ossuaries where like the bones of saints just sort of like show up and people are like, yeah, we don't actually know who these guys are or how they Got here, they gotta be saints. So, yeah, we."}

So thanks, everybody, for correcting us when we get our details wrong. And so these nine saints will lead us, in a way, in a very strange, surprising way, into the nine worthies today. So, Richard, take it. Take it away."}
{"episode_id":"SW - #194 - 2021-11-04 - Richard Rohlin - Secular Superheroes before Cancel Culture","start":508.21,"end":741.88,"speaker":"Richard Rohlin","text":"So that was a nice transition. So actually, you could probably just do an entire video. And I know there's a whole section in, I think, Matthieu's book about the symbolism of the number nine, which is very important in the ancient world in the Middle Ages. It's very important in Dante. Like, Dante's whole metrical scheme is around the symbolism of the number nine. I mean, it's not hard to understand. It's a triad of triads. Right. And sort of a heavenly fullness. Right. And so there are, of course, very famously, there are nine ranks of angels, mention of the Scriptures described by Saint Dionysus the Areopagite, and then also in the Orthodox Church, there are nine ranks of saints. And so I don't know how many people know this, but there's. There's actually like, if you think liturgy is long, the priest actually has his own liturgy that he has to do to prepare for everyone's liturgy. Right. So it's sometimes called, like, the liturgy of preparation. And essentially what the priest does is he ends up, you know, this is when he prepares the bread and the wine for the liturgy. And on the discos or the patens, the little metal plate on which the bread is placed, there's the Lamb, which is the piece for Christ, but then there are also smaller pieces. And I know that this gets really specific. And yes, you know who you are. I know that some people are going to message me and say, well, actually, it's a slightly different commemoration in the Byzantine tradition versus the Slavic tradition. I know that. But just for simplicity's sake, there's a particle for the Mother of God, and then there are these nine smaller particles for essentially nine ranks of saints. And so. And most of the saints in the Orthodox Church fall into, like, one of those categories. And, yeah, that there's a little bit of fluidity about, like, which. Which rank is exactly what, between various traditions. But there. There just seems to be the idea that if you're going to have a group of Holy people like this, there needs to be nine of them. So what I thought we would do is take our universal history series in a direction which nobody has asked for. Right. Everybody's like, when are you going to do Ireland? What are you going to do in America? What are you going to do? Et cetera. And I thought we would just do something that nobody's asked for at all, which is to talk about the nine worthies. And the reason that I wanted to do this is because one of the questions or another way to put this would be like, one of the realizations that I've had while doing this series with you and also discussing it with other people is just the way that these patterns manifest themselves even outside of the spaces that we have kind of delineated as sacred. And we didn't start specifically in sacred places. We started with just sort of secular medieval history when we started the series. But it very quickly moved into talking, especially when we get into Ethiopia and you have to really talk about all this stuff. So in our previous episode, an idea that I think really resonated with a lot of people is we talked about this idea that the saints uphold the world, and that this is both something that we believe to be sort of literally true, but also that it's a pattern which manifests itself in the lower regions of the mountain. That. That even the. The. The people that you venerate, maybe not necessarily as. As holy, but definitely as sacred in some way, like set apart in some way, or you say iconic of a people, group or of a city, those people that you. You set aside for veneration in some way do really become the connective tissue. You could say, like love or veneration is the connective tissue by which things cohere. Yeah."}

The people that you remember through statutes, through naming things. Obviously there's a hierarchy of that, but those are the people. These kind of. They're analogous to the idea of the saints or the. Just that uphold the fabric of society through memory, through common connection, through common identification."}
{"episode_id":"SW - #194 - 2021-11-04 - Richard Rohlin - Secular Superheroes before Cancel Culture","start":766.39,"end":815.92,"speaker":"Richard Rohlin","text":"Yeah. In his book the ethics of beauty, Dr. Petitsa says, talking about the sort of American love for veneration of the American soldier, which is something you can actually do without necessarily approving of the various wars those soldiers fought in. But that. If you go to Arlington National Cemetery, for instance, I almost said Arlington National Seminary. If you go to Arlington National Cemetery, or there's also a national cemetery here for veterans in the Place where I live, not a single one of those soldiers was killed for their country. They all gave their life for their country. Right. And so this is a kind of a different distinction. That's a good example of commemoration. Right. In the United States. I don't know if you guys have something like this up in Canadian land."}

{"episode_id":"SW - #194 - 2021-11-04 - Richard Rohlin - Secular Superheroes before Cancel Culture","start":824.15,"end":977.91,"speaker":"Richard Rohlin","text":"Yeah, yeah. In the United States, when, when a veteran dies, even if, you know, they just, you know, were in the army when they were young and then they, they got out of the army, they had a normal life and they died in old age, they're at the burial, there will be like, members of the military will show up and there will be like a flag folding ceremony and everything for that person. These are all like kind of like lower levels of commemoration. So when we talk about the nine worthies, the nine worthies are this group of men. And later on, because in the Middle Ages they're always like seeking symmetry and things. Later on there becomes also a group of nine worthy women to kind of parallel the nine worthy men. But this is, this is a list of people and their, their historical scriptural, legendary men, not necessarily saints, although you know, some of them, like Joshua in the Bible is obviously, you know, a saint in basically everybody's church. But, but they were selected for this list because they were seen to personify the ideals of chivalry which, which people really wanted to inculcate. And this starts in maybe you could say the 12 and the 1300s, which is when the idea of chivalry is really starting to come into its own. We often think of chivalry and the chivalric romance as being like a medieval thing, but it's actually kind of a Renaissance thing that was projected back into the Middle Ages. And it's not to say there were not chivalrous people in the Middle Ages, but it's. This is going to sound funny to some people, but go look it up. The Renaissance was a much more violent period than the Middle Ages was. And so there was this need to figure out what to do with that. The problem of, in some sense, societal problem number one you're always trying to solve is what I do with all my violent young men. And that's really the main problem that most societies are trying to deal with in some way or other. And so this is where the ideal of chivalry. So I think the first list was compiled in like 1312. So this is really where the idea of chivalry starts to be brought forward based on older literature, of course, things like the Song of Roland and Sir Gawain and the Green Knight and all the stuff which are much older than."}
{"episode_id":"SW - #194 - 2021-11-04 - Richard Rohlin - Secular Superheroes before Cancel Culture","start":977.99,"end":990.02,"speaker":"Jonathan Pageau","text":"Yeah, and just the Arthurian cycle, the different Arthurian cycle, the French cycles were already there, and so there were different. Different cycles. And just Aquitaine and that whole world of."}
{"episode_id":"SW - #194 - 2021-11-04 - Richard Rohlin - Secular Superheroes before Cancel Culture","start":990.26,"end":1063.87,"speaker":"Richard Rohlin","text":"Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, and the great thing about Aquitaine is that you have basically these troubadour kings who are like both wandering minstrels, but also knights, but also kings. And then you've got Eleanor, whose father was one of these troubadour kings, and Eleanor of Aquitaines, you know, Richard the Lionheart's father, mother, rather, but also the mother of literally every other king in Europe at that time. And she was really into this stuff. And so it's her daughters that become the patrons for Chrisienne de Troyes and all these other. The big Arthurian writers. And so it was a very colorful time and a very colorful kind of court there in Aquitaine. So the nine worthies are three pagans. So these are Hector of Troy, Alexander the Great, and Julius Caesar. Three Hebrews. So Joshua the son of nun, or Jesus in the Greek, David the king, and then Judah Maccabee, and then three Christians. And the three Christian kings are King Arthur, Charlemagne, and Godfrey of Bouillon. Am I saying that right?"}
{"episode_id":"SW - #194 - 2021-11-04 - Richard Rohlin - Secular Superheroes before Cancel Culture","start":1063.87,"end":1065.11,"speaker":"Jonathan Pageau","text":"Yeah, you're saying it pretty well."}
{"episode_id":"SW - #194 - 2021-11-04 - Richard Rohlin - Secular Superheroes before Cancel Culture","start":1066.15,"end":1236,"speaker":"Richard Rohlin","text":"I'm really pleased. Because I'm so bad at French. Yeah. So Godfrey of Bouillon, who most people maybe have not heard of. I think that's the surprise on the list. People are like, well, I've heard of those other guys, but, like, who's this Godfrey? So the reason that we're talking about this in universal history is to kind of tie two things together, which is one, how do these patterns manifest themselves in what we would now call secular spaces? Though perhaps they would not have recognized that use of the word secular in the 1300s. But how did these things manifest in secular spaces? Because we have these kinds of manifestations, and we have these kinds of heroes even now. We've talked a lot about Lincoln and things like this, but also, I know that you're sometimes a little down on superheroes, Jonathan. I don't know if you mean to come across that way or not, but. But obviously, obviously, the whole world of, like, superhero storytelling is a super mixed bag. Yeah, it's a super mixed bag, but also, I think there is. And I think we're going to have an essay about this. In Fighting the Golden Key, there is definitely a, let's say, a longing for this kind of commemoration, which is. Which is definitely manifesting itself in that space right now. And so when we find Images of the Nine Worthies, there's a very early 13th century carving, which I think is the earliest visual representation of them all together. And it's in Cologne in Germany, but it's not in a church or in a sacred place, it's in a city hall. And so the idea is that you could say that these nine men together represent the ideal of chivalry, of kingship, of lordship, but also they show the way in which a secular order in the 14th century, that really did mean the civil powers outside of the church powers, the way that a secular order could also participate in kind of this master narrative, this story of Western civilization that everybody was very consciously trying to write themselves into. So there are also statues. There's a fountain in Nuremberg, Germany, called the Beautiful Fountain. And you can go out and look at some pictures of these things online and I'm sure we'll have them in the video for people to see, which also shows the nine worthies. But at that same fountain, there are these different groups of people. And some of the groups are like apostles, saints, martyrs, et cetera. And then over here in this group, you have the nine worthies. Yeah."}

And so basically what this lets them do is they're able to bring in all of the three strains which basically constitute Western civilization, which are paganism and specifically Greco Roman paganism that are Jewish inheritance that we have as Christians, and then the great sort of icons of the Christian ruler, which for this particular list are King Arthur, Charlemagne and Godfrey of Bouillon, which for reasons we'll talk about in a second, it's funny that there's no Constantine."}

Yeah. So for those of you who have been hankering for some more Western Europe stuff, this is your day. So I thought what we could do is very quickly talk about each. Each one of the worthies and why they're included. And I think there are a lot of people out there who will be interested in going out and reading more of these people. There's definitely something that I've heard over and over again recently has been really a Cry or a hunger. Especially from a lot of young men who are into the symbolic world and other things like that for trying to navigate. What does it look like to be a man? What's it look like to be masculine? That's a really difficult thing to do right now. It seems like we're constantly falling into one error or the other. But this is a question that they're really concerned with in the Middle Ages, too. It was one of the dominant questions of, let's say, medieval legends and fiction."}

That's a reference to. This really comes. Comes from a Shakespeare play, but it's a. It's a reference to. It's a reference to the nine worthies, in other words.

Or like, you know, in armor. Yeah, in armor and things like this. And he would, like, walk around like this to, like, kind of consciously associate himself with the nine worthies. Actually, most of our. Most of our illustrations of the nine worthies come from a kind of book called an armorial, which is a book of heraldry. And it's A. It's a book intended to, like, teach you heraldry and, like, keep track of who in the kingdom has these different signs. So if you see this heraldic device, you'll be able to recognize that this is an important part of your education as a nobleman. And. But the first several pages, usually the first ten pages of an armorial, these are custom made books for very wealthy people. So the first ten pages of an armorial would be the nine worthies, and then the tenth page would be whoever commissioned the book. Okay. You know, and dressed up also like the nine worthies. And so the. Yeah."}

There was something that people, when they saw it, they said, yes, of course, these are the nine worthies. If it hadn't been. If it hadn't been something that people could recognize, then it wouldn't have lasted and it wouldn't have been perpetuated."}

One is, it's one of the most irritating things in the world to me when somebody says something like, oh, well, the title Theotokos was not approved until the Council of Ephesus, and therefore the veneration of the Mother of God began, like, on that date. Like, that's not how things work. That is not how anything. That's not how anything works. Like. So just a good rule of thumb, if you come across something and it says, like the first mention in a text that we have of this particular thing is this date, what you need to do is back up one to 200 years at a minimum before that date, and just assume this has been in the air long enough for somebody to write this down. So the most recent. So if this list was first coined in the early 1300s, the most recent person on the list is Godfrey Bouillon, who died in 1100. So he's not quite a contemporary, but he's really close. So obviously there Couldn't have been a list like this before he died. But this concept, we could just say this is the ultimate. The crystallization of this concept, which had been a part of Western Europe for a long, long time."}

And so what they had to go off of was mostly things like Virgil and other authors who were basically retelling the story in Latin or in some."}

So the thing about the Iliad is that it's actually so balanced. There are no. There's no good guys or bad guys in the Iliad. I mean, into their individual people, but the two sides, they're not. You know, it is a truly great work of art in that it is written with just deep sympathy for the human beings on both sides of this conflict. It's very complex work."}

Yeah, he's the best dude in the Iliad as well. So in. In the. In the legend that they had received and that gets told, retold in the stories of the nine worthies and all the way up to the time of Shakespeare, okay. When Shakespeare writes about the. His poem, his play about the fall of Troy in Troilus and Cressida, Hector is. He's so great. Achilles can't kill him in A fair fight. And so there are different variations of this. But for instance, in this particular work on the nine worthies, of course, they're all knights, so they're all jousting, right? So take that image that you have of hoplites and armor or Brad Pitt or whatever, and put that out of your head. And imagine just like full on heraldic devices, guys on horses jousting in front of the gates of Troy. That's how they portrayed it. And so there are several times during the conflict that Hector unseats Achilles but is not willing to kill him because it's not fair. He's not going to. He's not going to kill a downed opponent. And so then finally, in this particular telling, when Achilles finally decides, like the Greek leaders tell Achilles, okay, you have to kill Hector, you have to go out and kill him. Achilles comes out, and at a particular time, we're told that Hector is actually bearing up the body of one of the Greek princes who had died to bury him in honor. So Hector is just like, here's a worthy opponent. I'm going to carry his body and have it buried in state. And at that point, Achilles runs up and kills him when his back is turned."}

And actually a lot of the. All three of the pagan worthies in this telling die due to treason. Right. Julius Caesar is stabbed. Alexander is poisoned by his generals. And so Hector, the thing that makes Hector a worthy is, is his great valor in combat, which is this is gonna. Some people are gonna be like, yeah, great valor in combat. And some other people listening to this are gonna be like, oh, I don't know about, you know, and, you know, and there is death, definitely, one could say a strong pacifist inclination within traditional Christianity. Things that Christ says, the example that we have of many saints. There is also, however, a strong, say, vindication of the proper uses of violence within the tradition. Yeah."}

And it basically becomes what the peace of God in the Middle Ages was on a national level. Chivalry becomes on a personal level. So the idea of the peace of God is that there would be rules governing warfare. You could only do things in certain ways. You could only fight on certain days, you know, certain holy days and things like that were not days that was appropriate to campaign on. And for the Most part, during the Middle Ages, people kept to this, you know, and this is in Western Europe. And for the most part, people. People really stuck to this. And so you have a lot of wars in the Middle Ages, but the wars, by modern standards would just be, like, very small border skirmishes. It's not until the rise of secularism that we're able to just really kill each other in efficient ways and just, like, en masse. So there's definitely a. Let's say on a personal level, chivalry is a certain thing. So part of the code of chivalry, this comes up in Chretien's Percival. Part of the code of chivalry is there are certain days on which one does not bear arms. For instance, on Holy Friday, it just would not be appropriate to wear armor, to carry a sword, et cetera, and things like this. So the things that make Hector one of the worthies and really the first worthy, because everything kind of begins at Troy. The Trojan War is definitely where the west was born. Yeah. And Hector is sort of the great hero of that war from a medieval perspective. And so Hector is. He's really good at fighting, but he also shows mercy and love towards his opponents, and he's not willing to kind of take advantage of somebody in an unfair way. Yeah."}
{"episode_id":"SW - #194 - 2021-11-04 - Richard Rohlin - Secular Superheroes before Cancel Culture","start":2006.2,"end":2020.82,"speaker":"Jonathan Pageau","text":"And you can see that in the story, in the original story, the idea of Achilles misusing the body of Hector after he died is kind of a counterexample to the way in which the medievals would perceive the knight.

And so I think that actually that there's like an exact twist there. Right. From the way that Hector dies in the story, which is he dies because he's honoring the body of his foe. Yeah, exactly. Versus the way that Achilles treats his body in the Iliad. So that's kind of nice. So, yeah. So Hector is great. And by the way, Hector is. I mean, like, I'm just a massive Hector fanboy. Like, I should just, like, put that out now is one of my favorite. I don't know what you could say. Legendary figures, historical figures, whatever. People go back and forth on whether the Trojan War was actually historical. And I think actually the current thing is that actually it is historical, but people have been going back and forth on whether it was historical since the time of Thucydides. But what everybody has agreed on is that whether or not it was a historical thing, it's super important. And it's kind of the first. The first story in the West. So the second worthy, which will be no surprise to you, is Alexander the Great. Of course, Alexander the Great is, I think nowadays he would definitely be. Hashtag canceled. He's got a lot of, shall we say, problematic things about his life. The way that he, we're told. I mean, there's a ton of wild stuff in this particular retelling of Alexander. And definitely his sexual mores are not Christian. Not even the way like Hector's were. Like, Hector, despite not being a Christian, is, you know, faithful to his, to."}

{"episode_id":"SW - #194 - 2021-11-04 - Richard Rohlin - Secular Superheroes before Cancel Culture","start":2137.24,"end":2328.09,"speaker":"Richard Rohlin","text":"Yeah, yeah, yeah, this is the retelling. And so this is the thing, like when there are faults in these guys lives, they don't shy away from, from telling those things. Right. And this is, I mean, this is a thing like we're so, I, we're just such babies now, Jonathan. Like, we're, we're. I mean, we really are though. Like we're just giant babies. Like if there is, if there's a person whose life is worthy and, and worthy of emulation in a lot of different ways, but then they have like one thing wrong with them. Yeah, we're like, well, sorry, that person's problematic. And, and like, I don't care if it's the right or the left. Like, yeah, this is just in the air right now. We're just like we're, we're so fragile. Yeah. And so they're setting up Alexander as kind of the, in the medieval perspective, you could say he's the, you know, if Hector is the first knight, Alexander is the first emperor. Right? And of course everyone agrees that you should have an emperor, and everyone agrees that whoever the emperor is should be kind of the best and most worthy person. And so even though Alexander has a lot of, he has a lot of faults, he's portrayed in this retelling as being he loses his temper and kills somebody who's really close to him, but then after that he shows so much remorse that he starves himself and they eventually have to force him to start eating again. So it's kind of like. It's not saying it's okay that he did that thing, but also he did demonstrate repentance and love afterwards. And the way that it's sort of portrayed is that. Is that Alexander is this. I mean, he's like this really dynamic young genius, which he was. But that he had sort of the wrong people around him, which is not saying it wasn't his fault, but we're told he had this influence from this particular Greek philosopher, not Aristotle in this case, but one of the people who was one of Aristotle's students, who basically told him, well, you should be. Look at all your achievements. You should be worshipped as a God. And Alexander, being very young, having this mentor tell him you should be worshipped as a God, said, oh, I guess I should be worshipped as a God. But then we're told, but the Macedonian soldiers would have none of it and just continued to salute him as their general. And he was also fine with that. And so there's some fun stuff in here. One thing that's in here is when he conquers India, he's seduced by the Indian queen, whose name was Cleophas, not Cleopatra. Cleophas, but she does a very Cleopatra thing, which is she basically buys her kingdom back by seducing Alexander and then has a son from him whom she names Alexander. And of course, eventually Cleopatra seduces Julius Caesar and then they have a son that they name Julius Caesar. But, I mean, this is a real symbolism happens moment because Cleophas is a. I mean, she's a real historical figure. Like, there's no ambiguity about. About it. The ambiguity would be around, like, who her son. Who her son's father actually was."}

And the way that, like, the Greco Roman chroniclers would write about it is they would say. They would say that, oh, she had a son named Alexander. Whoever her father. Whoever his father might have been. Might have been. Yeah. Wink, wink, wink, wink. But of course, it's significant. She's the. She's the queen of India in this particular telling, which is we've talked about the overlap between India and Ethiopia, and as the stealer of the heart and all that. So you have all those things going on in the story. What makes Alexander great? Lots and lots of things. I mean, he. He defeats his enemies, but he's really fair to everyone. He conquers that. That comes out over and over again. And he. So he has. He has a bunch of faults, but also he's at the end of the day, like, he's. He's great because of. Because of his accomplishments and because. Because of his, let's say, the just way that he treated the people that. Whom he defeated. Right. So that in. So you have this idea that you should be in victory. You should be. You should be moderate and subdued in the way that you. Again, unlike us, like, we're such. Like, we're like, just little toddlers. Even, like on the Internet, as soon as somebody scores a point against somebody else, you know, they just, like, they're ready to dance on the grave, you know? And the medieval ideal of chivalry is that you really. You should. You should be able to win your fights, but also, when you win, you've got to be gracious. And I will just say one last thing, which is they were not inattentive to the fact that Alexander died at the age of 33, which is, of course, also the age that Christ died at. And a lot of people seem to have noticed this and commented on it in various ways. There's a lot of stuff in this particular retelling that is missing. There's no gates of Alexander. There's no griffin chariot, anything. And for the most part, all of these tellings are very grounded. You could say there is not a whole lot of what we consider to be, like, mythical material that's actually in them. They're pretty grounded. All right, so third guy on the list is, of course, Julius Caesar. I don't think I need to introduce Caesar to anyone. And basically, everything you know or have heard about Caesar is in this retelling. Why is Caesar included? He's included because he becomes this sort of this model of kingship. And nowadays we're conditioned to think of Caesar as kind of a bad guy."}

But the answer is Dante sees. And Dante's not the reason, but Dante just as part of his whole world, they saw Julius Caesar as being sort of the first manifestation, you could say, of the ideal Roman man or the ideal Roman emperor. Well, Scipio Africanus is the first ideal Roman man, but then Caesar's the first ideal Roman emperor. And so the idea was that Caesar was setting up a. He was setting up, like, a perfect Reign, and basically, he had subdued the world. He was going to bring peace to the world. And again, Caesar shows great clemency to his enemies, who aren't Gauls."}

No, but when he defeats Pompey's army and people like this, he shows great clemency to them, but also, like, he doesn't put up with traitors. He doesn't put up with, you know, people trying to go behind him and things like this, ironically, I guess, because that's how he dies. But. But in the. In the end. In the end. So in. In the lowest region of hell in the Inferno, right, One of the three people who's imprisoned there, you know, you have three famous traitors, and one of them is Brutus. Brutus, right. And so for Dante, the worst possible sin that you could commit would be not just treachery, but treachery against your Lord. And so in the structure of hell, you have, like, hell is all these nested descending circles. But then the final tier in hell of circles is a city. Right? And so the point is that these are the crimes that caused, like, these other things are like, animal passions, but these are the crimes that cause human civilization to cease to cohere. Dante saw happening in Florence and he saw happening in Italy around him at that particular time. And so what's the thing at the end of the day that most does that? Well, it's assassinating your. What they would have considered to be, like, your lawful ruler. Right. That. That's the thing that's going to cause society to cease to cohere. Yeah, yeah. So Julius Caesar is on here. And I'll just say each one of these begins with, like, a little poem. And so we're told, great Julius Caesar next attained the name of the third worthy, whose immortal fame remains still fresh in records of time. He to the empire of the world did climb, and what he conquered by his sword in fight, he with his pen did elegantly write. This is not great poetry. But at length, through many wounds, his soul hence fled. And he who ne' er before was conquered in war, he who with slaughter strewed so many lands with his own blood and brood the seat of wronged justice and fell down a sacrifice to appease the incensed gown. So there's definitely this idea of Caesar being a, let's say, a precursor of Christ and that he was a sacrifice that was necessary for the public peace. Right. And so in, like, The Gospel of St. John, it says, you know, they say it is necessary that one man should die for his nation. Right. And that's how they sort of saw what happened to Caesar, as. It's sort of like, it's regrettable that Caesar had to be killed. It's regrettable that he kind of grasped for power too quickly. But at the end of the day, he becomes sort of a martyr to the peace of the Roman Empire. And it's because of that. I mean, it makes a note in here to say not a single one of the people who assassinated Caesar outlived him by more than two years. All of those people. And it's really the death of Caesar, at least in this particular telling, it's the death of Caesar that galvanizes the Roman people and makes the rise of Augustus a thing that's actually possible. Basically, from that point forward, the people at large can't conceive of going back to the older way of doing things. Okay, so that's Caesar. We'll move on to Joshua. Everything in the. In the story about Joshua is just exactly what's in the Bible. So I'm going to assume people either have a familiarity with that. If they don't, there are lots of Bibles out there. So go buy one. Just go buy one. I don't know what to say. Like, the book of Joshua is super, super awesome. But I will say this. This is how his story begins. It says, who can see the sun and not remember Joshua and the great commerce that this valorous captain had with the king of stars, which is just. I mean, that's. The king of stars is God in this case, right? You know, making the sun stand still. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And the host, you know, the starry host, the host of heavens, kind of like fighting on the side of Joshua. All the world lift their eyes up to it. That is the sun, but none he hath lifted up his voice so far as it to make himself be heard and obeyed. The stars knew Joshua or Jesus because he bore the name of him that formed them. It is he that gave us the foretaste of the name Jesus, at which the heaven, the earth and hell do bend the knee. So, and I. And it goes on to talk. There's a really lengthy and actually quite beautiful digression at the beginning of this, talking about. So I think sometimes, like, especially if you came from, like, an evangelical background, we read Joshua as sort of like the. The kind of lesser sequel to Moses. Like, Moses is really great. And then Joshua is kind of. And then after Joshua dies, everything just Goes to hell."}

But Joshua was not seen that way in the early Christian communities and even, even now in the orthodox church or in these medieval stories. So you have this sort of play on words in the Gospel according to St. John in chapter one says the law came by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ. Right. So that's a play in words because of course, Jesus in Greek is Joshua. Right. That's the name of Moses successor. Right. So Joshua was the one who's actually able to enter the promised land. He's the one that's able to perform everything that God set before him and conquer the enemies of God, et cetera. Right."}

So you've got Joshua, who's great, we're told, because he's so much worthier than the three before him because they worship false gods. But he worshiped the true God by whose power he caused the sun and moon to stand still. So pretty cool stuff. Number five on the list and the exact middle point in the list is David. And again, there's nothing surprising in, in the David thing. Like, it's just all the stuff that's in the Bible. People should read the life of David like a lot, I think, because."}

You guys said we could do this kind of a thing. And, I mean, that's a historical fact, but it's also in this legend. Again, the Christians who put this list together still had Maccabees in their Bible. So everything that's in the legend. Again, there's nothing surprising. If you've read first and second Maccabees, you already know all this stuff. Why is he in the list? Okay, Joshua. That's easy. David. Super easy to figure out why David is enlist. David is also a great example of somebody who would be just totally hashtag canceled. He's just. I mean, David is just like. He's literally all over the place. He's so crazy. And there's very frank discussion in his legend here about the whole Bathsheba thing and what goes on there and the way that all of the bad stuff that eventually happens to David's family kind of goes back to that. And in spite of all of that. Okay, I will say one thing. So this is cool. Do you know, I'm sure you remember when David gets the idea that he. He wants to build the temple, and he says it's shameful that the Ark of God should dwell in tents while I live in a palace. Right. So something that his legend kind of points out, which I'd never noticed before, but it's totally just in the Bible. Okay. Is that. That is an exact, almost word for word, parallel to what Uriah says when David tells him to come home, When David orders him home to, like, cover up the fact that Bathsheba is pregnant. Yeah. Uriah says it would be shameful for me to dwell in a house while Joab and the Ark of God are dwelling in tents. Really, it's the same thing. And I don't know what to do with that."}

And I mean, again, like, that's. That's just in the Bible. But the. The guy that was Putting these legends together. Notice. Kind of noticed the parallels there. So that's okay. That's cool. So Judah Maccabees, why is he included? He's included mainly because he was a very successful military commander. His big thing, the big thing that the Maccabees are kind of known for is that they were willing to die to defend God's truth and the law of God. And of course, the whole story of the Maccabees is very important to us. It's an early exemplar of the idea of the veneration of the saints in Second Temple Judaism and all this different stuff. And, of course, Judah dies the way that a knight should die, which is in battle. Right. So he kind of goes out fighting, and we're told, what are the things that make him great? The people wept and made great lamentation for the death of a commander so valiant. For whatsoever virtue hath of great, whatsoever valor hath of generous, met in the person of Judah Maccabees to make a marvel of his life and give immortal memory to his name. In the space of six years, he sustained the great and prodigious forces of three kings of Asia, as you have heard, opposing himself with a little flying camp, in other words, like a little guerrilla force against armies of 40, 60 and 100,000 men, which he put into disorder and confusion. He defeated nine generals of the infidels in ranged battles and combats, killing some with his own hands, carrying away their spoils, so that all of his great qualities, valor, always held the upper rank and worthily entitled him to the name of worthy. So in the list, he's actually the one who's most known for valor. So he's the third Jew in the list. And then we get to the three Christians. The first one is Arthur.

They ask questions like, well, did X really happen? Or whatever he's introduced with saying, the British writers have related such strange and miraculous actions and adventures of this worthy prince that many intelligent men have been apt to think that all which hath been written of his heroic deeds is mere fiction and invention. Yea, some are of the opinion that there never was any such person. But though historians disagree about times and places, some writing carelessly and others superstitiously, all those superstitious historians out there, yet they all agree upon the predecessors and successors of this noble king. But as it is most awful infidelity to doubt that there was a Joshua, it is a wicked atheism to question if there were a David, and totally unreasonable to deny the being of Judah Maccabees. It may be judged folly to affirm that there was never any Alexander. Julius Caesar. Caesar Godfrey, Julius Caesar. That's a bad Julius Caesar joke. Or Charlemagne. So we may be thought guilty of incredulity and ingratitude to deny or doubt the honorable acts of our victorious Arthur. And this is premise in vindication of our hero and his immortal name and fame, whereby he justly gained the title of the seventh worthy of the world. And now onto his history.

You know, like he has his knights at the round table. And if Arthur wasn't so great, then surely one of those guys would be in this list. But Arthur eclipses all of them for his acts of chivalry, which is actually also. I mean, that's in the more popular Arthur in material as well. The thing that makes Arthur great, I think, is the fact that A, he is just like the perfect embodiment of all the chivalric legends. Right. And all of the other knights had these different Fatal flaws to some degree or other. But it's not until much later that Arthur is also given one of those.

He retook Jerusalem and then died a year or two after retaking Jerusalem. And he was the ruler of Jerusalem after it was retaken, but he refused the title of the King of Jerusalem. And I think he's on this list for a few reasons. One is within 10 or 20 years of his death, there are already legends about him, you know, like fighting bears and decapitating camels with a single stroke of a sword. And actually a bunch of the same kind of legends that get attributed to Richard the Lionheart, who's another famous crusader. Obviously I was a big Richard the Lionheart fan as a kid for obvious reasons. But almost immediately after his death, you could say that he became. People considered him to be the apex of the Christian knight. All of these things had been setting up to that. And then he was the perfect example of what it looked like in practice. So he was somebody that was within kind of living memory when these lists started being put together as somebody that you could look at and very consciously say he's one of the. He was the greatest knight of his day when he conquered Jerusalem and he was set up to rule it. He was presented with a crown that's really richly adorned with pearls and all these different things, and he refused it. And he said, why would I bear the name of a king in a place where my savior was crowned with reproaches? Why would I take a scepter in my hand where he took the cross upon his shoulders? Why would I suffer a crown of gold upon my head where he received a crown of thorns? So he refused the title of king. And I think this is the thing at the end of the day that makes him worthy of inclusion on this list was not just his valor in battle, but at the end of the day, his, His. His unwillingness to seize power."}

Where else would this happen? So he, He. He only rules Jerusalem for a couple of years, and he dies in the year 1100 and a couple of years later, and then his brother Baldwin takes. But Baldwin takes the title King of Jerusalem. Like he, he, he accepts the crown, but. But Godfrey didn't. And Godfrey's on this list and Baldwin isn't. So there you go."}

So it's like we celebrate all this civil power, but we end with something which recognizes that it's obviously in a certain manner. There's a vanity to it. And the one we recognize the most is the one that kind of gave it up to God, let's say."}
{"episode_id":"SW - #194 - 2021-11-04 - Richard Rohlin - Secular Superheroes before Cancel Culture","start":4002.13,"end":4107.43,"speaker":"Richard Rohlin","text":"And so I think, yeah, he's sort of the plenitude of the whole list. Right. At the end of the day, this list is not to say, hey, you, secular ruler, you should be Charlemagne. You should be like Charlemagne in certain respects. You should defend the Church, and you should. This, that, and the other thing. It's not saying you should be Judah Maccabees, though. You should be like him in certain respects. But the very last person in the list is Godfrey. And Godfrey does all of these things, but then he refuses the crown. He says Christ is the only real king of Jerusalem. And the, the worthies are. They're all over monuments, civic buildings, fountains, things like that, in these public, secular spaces. They're also a major genre of, let's say, of drama in the Middle Ages and even into the Renaissance like this is. There are, you know, plays within plays and Shakespeare's plays that are masques, you know, M A, S, Q E, Q U, E. There are masks or plays about the lives of the various nine worthies. So these guys were in some sense like sort of superheroes. Yeah, right. That they were like historical, kind of a little contemporary. You know, Hector's On a night on a. On a horse with a lance, you know, so they're historical, they're kind of contemporary, but they're also a little bit legendary. But they sort of like caught up the whole ideal of. Into themselves, of what did it look like in Western Europe to be a noble, to be chivalrous, to be worthy, in other words, to have. What does it look like when the virtues manifest themselves in a person who is maybe not exactly a saint, but is still worthy of."}

And it's interesting because indifferent from hagiography, where in hagiography there would just be this kind of celebration of the saint almost without reserve. In these texts and in these celebrations, you find the reserve as part of the way that they're remembered, that exactly here they are remembered for these virtues, but we also acknowledge these problems that they had and these faults. So it's a balanced tradition."}

Why did it have to be nine? Because you need, like, for this picture of chivalry to be something that really has legs and is really part of this coherent picture in this vision of the world that they possessed in the Middle Ages. You've got to have all three pieces. You've got to have your Greeks, Romans, you've got to have the Jewish inheritance, and you've got to have the Christians, culminating in this example of this Christian who actually kind of goes all the way back to the start. He goes east."}

I don't know if this is something that happened historically or not, but it mentions that he was at one point on his way to Constantinople. So he goes east and he goes back to Jerusalem and the circle sort."}

So it's a cool way to see how something like popular literature, drama, veneration, all these things in the Middle Ages were able to tie into and down to just like ornamentation and architecture. We're able to tie into the universal history in this way. Yeah."}
{"episode_id":"SW - #194 - 2021-11-04 - Richard Rohlin - Secular Superheroes before Cancel Culture","start":4211.94,"end":4252.6,"speaker":"Jonathan Pageau","text":"All right. So this has just been great. Just one more example and a very kind of thoughtful example of universal history and also an understanding of how we have a sad version of the Middle Ages or of that period of time where it was all propaganda. It was all just, you know, that there wasn't the subtlety of understanding that we moderns have. But in this tradition, we do actually find a kind of powerful subtlety in recognizing the strength and the weaknesses of our ancestors and celebrating them nonetheless, and not wanting to cancel and destroy their memory because they're not perfect and they're not Christ incarnate, you know, all of them."}
{"episode_id":"SW - #194 - 2021-11-04 - Richard Rohlin - Secular Superheroes before Cancel Culture","start":4252.76,"end":4393.02,"speaker":"Richard Rohlin","text":"Yeah, these takes are wonderfully complex in lots of ways. And, yeah, there's definitely a. You can think about the situation that somebody might have found themselves in the 1300s, looking at this list and being like, oh, yeah, these are great. This is. You know, and this is. I mean, this is popular literature, right? This is like, common people were really into these stories and really into these figures. And for that person to find themselves under the rule of a local lord or a king who was maybe not perfect in every respect, but also, a knight is still a knight. I once read this medieval account, I can't remember where it is now, about this man who walked 100 miles in a week to go because he heard that a certain princess was going to be passing through the city, and he just wanted to have the experience of seeing a princess. And it was just like a common man. And this is a sort of. We can't conceive now of something like that. I mean, I guess people will go to see celebrities, things like that, but we also sort of, like. They would have thought of, like, a princess as being, like, in some ways, like, ontologically different. Like, seeing a princess is really different from seeing a woman. Right. They're not totally the same thing. And so if you find yourself, like, under one of these. These guys who's not the best, but then you can still see that he participates in these certain aspects of the chivalrous king, the chivalrous man, the perfect knight, and participates in them to some greater or lesser degree, you can kind of celebrate and give your attention to those parts of his life, not these other parts. I'll just close with this, talking about Godfrey. It says, and this is the end of the book, says he was a prince in whom all virtues, Christian, civil and military. So those are the three kinds of virtues that each of these guys represent to some degree, Christian virtues, civil virtues, military virtues, met in the highest point of humane perfection, without mixture of any default, so that it will remain difficult to find another like to him whom without flattery the same praises may be given, and which induced future ages to bestow upon him the honorable title of one of the worthies of the world. That's great."}
