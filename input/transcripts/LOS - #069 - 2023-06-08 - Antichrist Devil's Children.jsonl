The modern world doesn't acknowledge, but is nevertheless haunted by spirits, angels, demons and saints. In our time, many yearn to break free of the prison of a flat secular materialism, to see and to know reality as it truly is. What is this spiritual reality like? How do we engage with it? Well, how do we permeate everyday life with spiritual presence? Orthodox Christian priests, Father Andrew Stephen Damick and Fr.

You guessed it, folks. It is the start of our new series on eschatology. This evening's eschatological marvel is the Antichrist. Is it Antichrist time again already? Is he alive right now? How would we spot the signs? I don't know about you, but when I'm looking around for the Antichrist, I always ask for myself. Is Lenny Bruce not afraid? What do you think, Father?

If you just had a like really evil sounding name. But yeah. So we, of course, as always, are going way back into the long ago time to talk about the Antichrist. So the Antichrist, the way it's presented, at least the way most people are probably familiar with it from like movies and TV shows. Other than Good Omens, which Good Omens is, I think, just a documentary about eschatology. Spoilers. You could just watch Omens or read the book. Better than watching it. Read the book and not listen to the show. But if you're going to still listen to the show anyway, the idea of the Antichrist as sort of popularly presented would. And even the term Antichrist would sort of firmly make you think this is a Christian thing. Right. This is, this is some kind of novum that this is. And there are other things here we'll be taking apart as we go forward in this series. Right. But there are, there are a whole series of assumptions that, for example, before Christ's ascension into heaven, everybody had thought that the Messiah was only going to come once, and then that once he came that would be the end and that's it. And so when he didn't, this is, it's often presented this way, even. Yeah. Scholar. We'll have more to say about them later. But scholars will say, oh, well, the, the, you know, the, the apostles were intending, they firmly believed Christ was going to return within their lifetimes. And so then when he didn't, they had to, you know, figure out, oh, no, what, what do we do? We need institutional structures."}

Yeah. So that, of course is a silly assumption that we'll be taking apart that more later. But so because of that sort of assumption, everybody assumes that any detailed element of Christian eschatology, including the Antichrist, must be something that sort of showed up somewhere in the 2nd 3rd century at the earliest. At the earliest. Some of our listeners may have the impression that this is something that showed up with dispensationalism or something like in the 18th or 19th century. Not. So the idea of an anti Messiah. Because remember, Christos is just the Greek word for messiah."}

But that's not the passage where really this, this stuff is crystallized. And in the place where it's most crystallized, the term Antichrist does not actually occur. Right, Yep. There are other terms that are used to describe this figure, but it is this figure. So the place where this really gets laid out and broken down is actually in the second chapter of Second Thessalonians by St. Paul. And this is the other two texts that really speak directly. I mean, substantive texts that speak directly in the New Testament of the Antichrist are written by St. John and are written later than second Thessalonians. So this is the first canonical Christian text that talks about the Antichrist. That's one of the reasons why it's important. It's important because it's kind of a systematic drawing together of the pre existing Jewish traditions by St. Paul. And it seems to be, I mean, we can't prove this, but it seems to be referred back to by St. John. So beside the book of Revelation in second Thessalonians, the other text that really talks about the Antichrist that actually uses that term is first John. Yeah. St. John's first epistle. And in that at one point he says, you have heard that an Antichrist will come. So he's saying this, you know, they've already heard this. Right?"}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #069 - 2023-06-08 - Antichrist Devil's Children","start":894.55,"end":901.27,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Yeah. So he's referring to something might be this might be from St. Paul, but might also just be, you know."}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #069 - 2023-06-08 - Antichrist Devil's Children","start":904.37,"end":1059.23,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"But the reason why I think there's good reason to believe it might be from Saint Paul is that number one, Saint John doesn't say, you remember I told you this, or as I have taught you. Right. He just says you've heard meaning, implying it's from someone else. And number two, if you think about where St. John was active in and around Ephesus in western Asia Minor, these are churches that were planted by St. Paul. Right. So I think there's good reason to believe that the teaching St. John is referring back to is St. Paul's teaching. How likely it is that any of those churches had the text of Second Thessalonians is open to question. Yeah, right. We're talking about very early. Right. But it's not impossible that they did. And even if they didn't have access to the text, of course, if they had St. Paul saying the same thing directly to them. Right. They're receiving the same tradition, the same teaching that we find recorded in writing in 2nd Thessalonians 2. So it's reasonable to believe that St. John is referring to what is outlined by St. Paul in 2nd Thessalonians. So as with 1st Thessalonians and 2nd Thessalonians, one of the major themes that St. Paul is after is Christ's quote, unquote, second coming or return. He uses language here of his appearing. The term parousia is used that usually gets translated as return. I'm sure I've said this before here on the show. I'm not super partial to the translation of Return for Parousia because, number one, it's not a great translation, but number two, it's very misleading because it kind of implies that when Christ ascended, he went away somewhere, and then he's going to come back. And, you know, lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age. Right. Like, right before he ascends. So that kind of implies he didn't, like, depart for parts unknown where the ultimate warrior came from, by the way, anyway. And then, you know, someday he's going to come back. So parousia literally means, like, presence. So you could say, well, if someone isn't present and they become present, that's where the return translation comes from. Right?"}

Again. Yeah. And so in First Thessalonians, St. Paul was really trying just to get at the idea of, like, this is a thing that's going to happen, and people are going to rise from the dead when it happens. And the reason for that is we have to remember he's writing these letters to Thessalonica. So this is a Greek city."}

And even in Jewish circles, this was a controversial idea at this time. Right. So the Pharisees very much believed in the body resurrection, but like, the Sadducees and some other Jewish sects did not. Right. So there's that famous episode where St. Paul is in front of a bunch of Jewish leaders in Acts. And so he says he's there because of the resurrection and gets them fighting amongst themselves over the theological issue. Right. But so the idea that sort of the nascent Christian community that has this converted Jewish core and then a bunch of Gentiles, this Jewish core, they're a bunch of Gentiles. The idea that he would have to reinforce the idea of the resurrection in first Thessalonians makes perfect sense. Right. Like. Yeah, no, this is. This is the teaching. I know some of the Jewish Christians there may not have subscribed to this in the past, and I know you pagans are clueless about this. Former pagans. But right, here it is. And so in Second Thessalonians, he's sort of digging a little deeper into that, beyond just the fact of it, beyond just the fact of Christ appearing and the resurrection of the dead and the judgment. Right now he's going a little deeper. And so he's going to talk about this Antichrist figure. And so in the first couple verses of chapter two, he sort of calls them back to the topic, right, of Christ's imminent appearing of the. The parresia. And then in verse three, he talks about an event that is going to happen first."}

The other common mode today would be that this is something that's going to have a particular event that's going to happen in the future. So this is this sort of particular great apostasy. But it's not something that's just happened here in our lifetime, but it's something that's going to happen. And Luther, Joseph Smith et al just misidentified it. Right. And that view is just that at some point in the future, most of the church will fall away. And that's sometimes very vague and ambiguous as to exactly what that means. People will appeal to Christ saying, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith upon the earth? Right. Just to say it's going to dwindle down a lot. Right.

They left their stand. And that's going to become very important here as we go forward in this passage. And what St. Paul is talking about, the fact that that had a military use. But when you get to the end of chapter two of Second Thessalonians, where St. Paul sort of gives his exhortation to the Christians in Thessalonica, he uses stikhita, which means. Which is the.

I know we've mentioned before on the show that biblical authors like to use because it can have two different shades of meaning. And so they can use the word imply both.

You could make that all day long. But those comparisons are kind of irrelevant to everyone else. Whereas what St. Paul is very clearly doing in Romans 5 is talking about how these two men, Adam and Christ, are archetypal men. Right. These are men whose decisions and actions affect more than just an individual person. Yeah, right. That affects humanity. Affects what we would call, using a little later terminology, human nature itself. Right. Humanity itself is affected by the actions of these two men. Right. And so, in a unique way, St. Paul is setting out Adam and Christ as not just individual instances of human nature, but as embodying and hypostatizing. Right. The human nature in a very particular and special way, beyond the way like I do. Right. And so Adam. Right. By virtue of that, what he does brings death to all of humanity.

So what we're talking about is not just someone who breaks rules. Right. They're breaking the law. Right. But this is someone who has sort of thrown off it, especially in the context that St. Paul is using it. Right. Where the nomos, when St. Paul talks about it, is talking about the Torah. This is someone who has thrown off like that way of life is opposed to that way of life. Right. The way of life taught by God they have rejected. And so we have to account for. Why does St. Paul choose this word here? Because he could have just use the word sin. You could just call this the man of sin. Right. And sin and lawlessness do in other authors, other Jewish authors get used as synonyms. A good example is in first John 3, 4, St John says all sin is lawlessness."}

But there's good evidence here that this is a place where St. Paul is using the word lawlessness because he's bringing in some of these traditions, these second Temple traditions about the anti Messiah to bear. And that's chiefly in the figure of, when you look at, if you do just a broad survey, as is my want of second Temple Jewish literature on something like this, when they give a name to. We've talked before on the show how there are all these different names of different, like devil or Satan figures in second Temple literature and stuff that we've talked about."}

Yeah. But you know, obviously the devil, Satan, but also Azazel, Samuel, Mastema in Jubilees. But the one of those that most commonly gets used in reference to the anti Messiah, to the Messiah's eschatological opponent is actually Belial or Belial. It's pronounced different ways by different folks. I think the accepted English translation or pronunciation is Belial."}

And so there's some debate as to the etymology of Belial. It's not Belial. It's not somebody talking about bail in the Deep South. It's. But so there are different, there are different ideas. But I think the strongest case is that it comes from Belly Oliver in Aramaic because of the time at which we start seeing this Name used in this context, we start seeing it used in this context in Aramaic literature. It is a term that gets used before that, but that's where we start to see it. And if it is from Belial, it literally means yokeless, Right. Not having a yoke. And that yoke is a common metaphor for nomos or Torah. Right. All the way up through Ben Sirach uses it. And then Christ basically quotes Ben Sirach, it looks like when he famously says, take my yoke upon you, for my yoke is easy and my burden is light. Right. So the idea that this is the yokeless one. Right. Sort of would establish lawlessness as his defining. His defining character. Right. And so in second, just to give Some examples from Second Temple Jewish literature, Jubilees 15, verse 32 describes uncircumcised Gentiles as the sons of Belial, which, I."}

But the Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs is the most important Second Temple Jewish text for Christians to read, especially if you want to understand St. Paul and most of the rest of the New Testament. But in the Testament of Twelve Patriarchs, the term sons of Belial is used to refer to idolaters and the sexually immoral, who also are probably uncircumcised Gentiles for the most part, from the perspective of that book, at least in the ascension of Isaiah 2, verse 4, in the Ascension of Isaiah, Belial is kind of the devil figure in general in opposition to Isaiah, but he is described as the angel of lawlessness, who is the ruler of this world, Belial. And St. Paul actually references. Actually uses the name Belial, transliterates it in one place."}

And so Christ being again, the Greek word for Messiah. Right. Messiah and Belial obviously are opposed. Right. Definitionally by this time in terms of the tradition. But so the thing that really clinches the deal that man of Lawlessness is talking about man of Belial is that in Proverbs 6:12, 15, it talks about Adam Belial. The man of Belial."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #069 - 2023-06-08 - Antichrist Devil's Children","start":3151.54,"end":3174.42,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Yeah. So here's what that says. The man of Belial, a wicked man, goes about with crooked speech, winks with his eyes, signals with his feet, points with his finger, with perverted heart, devises evil continually sewing discord. Therefore calamity will come upon him. Suddenly, in a moment, he will be broken beyond healing. Yeah, he's like flashing gang signs or."}

Yes, Gesticulations are the deepest form of sin. No, these are actually referring to ideas of seduction, of ideas of scoffing and mockery, of plotting secretly and conspiring. But you can see in the language there in Proverbs, the man of Belial, he here is being referred to in this archetypal. These archetypal terms. Right. That's why it's Adam Belial. Right. That Adam here is being used for the same kind of general sense. And so when St. Paul applies this to this particular person, who's going to emerge eschatologically again, he's using it archetypically to say this is going to be sort of the ultimate instance of this type. Right. But not the only instance of this type, but this is going to be sort of the ultimate embodiment, the ultimate encapsulation of. Of this type. And so then. So man of lawlessness, which I'm saying is he's. He's applying these man of Belial traditions is the first title by which St. Paul refers to this figure. The second one then is the Son of Destruction in the translation you read sometimes. Son of Perdition is how it's translated in English that Fr. This phrase occurs one other time in. In Scripture, in St. John's Gospel 17, verse 12, to describe. Christ uses it to describe Judas when he says in his prayer that he hasn't lost anyone except the Son of Perdition. The Son of."}

The Nephilim. Who are these mighty men? Who are these God kings. Right. Or so they claim. And so this title calls us back to that idea. Right. In terms of referring to the Antichrist.

In a lot of English translations because of that. Right. But that's not what it says. So in this case also. Right. He opposes and exalts himself against everything called a God or object of piety. Right. And why is that phrasing. That particular phrasing is important because in that first clause there, St. Paul is not referring to God himself, yet the second clause, he refers to God, capital G. Yeah.

You made him for a little while lower than the angels. You have crowned him with glory and honor, putting everything in subjection under his feet. Now, in putting everything in subjection to him, he left nothing outside his control. At present, we do not yet see everything in subjection to him, but we see him who for a little while was made lower than the angels, namely Jesus, crowned with glory and honor because of the suffering of death, so that by the grace of God, he, He might taste death for everyone."}

He puts himself underneath all that and then is crowned with glory and honor, is exalted by God the Father. Right. So look again at how St. Paul describes the Antichrist. The Antichrist opposes and exalts himself against all of those things. Right. So this is an inversion of what Christ does. Right. Same things would be true of the second clause. So that says that he takes his seat in the temple of God is how it's usually pronounced. And this is God, capital G. The article is used. Right. This is one of the signals in Greek when you're. Especially with Jewish authors, obviously, about whether we're talking about. When you have O Theos. In this case, it's a genitive. It's too the oo."}

So he takes his seat in the temple of God, capital G. So a lot of our dispensationalist friends want to take this very literally. Right.

This is a practice of the Orthodox Church that, you know, if a bunch of people are sitting and the bishop walks into the room, everybody stands up. Right. Or they're supposed to."}

And then usually he, you Know, gives you a blessing and tells you to sit back down. And he goes, it's that. But this is a. This is a sign of. Of honor and respect still. So to remain seated mean if you. Or if you walk into someone's presence and you sit down first, that's saying, either I am in authority over you or I'm at least your equal. I'm at least your peer, right? And one of the ways in which you see in the Talmud, We've talked before on the show about the. The idea of two powers in heaven in the Second Temple period and how that relates to the later Christian doctrine of the Trinity. But one of the ways in which later Rabbinic Judaism sort of got rid of that idea, said that idea was wrong, is in a story that's recounted in the Talmud about a particular rabbi who has this vision where he's taken up to heaven and he sees this figure, this angelic figure who is sitting. And since he's sitting in heaven, in the presence of God, this rabbi believes, oh, this is the second. This is the second power in heaven. And then finds out he was horribly wrong. And the angel who had the gall to sit down gets taken and whipped, Right? So, but that gives you an idea, right? That gives you an idea of what it means to sit. So the word here that's translated as temple is naon, which is used in the Greek Old Testament tradition to translate buy it or bait in Hebrew, which can mean temple or can mean house. And so the idea here is that this is a person who would dare to sit in the presence of God, capital G. Yeah. I. E. He makes himself equal to God, capital G. Right? So this is sort of the height of hubris and pride and arrogance. Right? Again, contrast from St. Paul. Compare this to Philippians 2, verses 6 through 11, sometimes called the Carmen Christie. Right? We're talking about Christ. He did not consider equality with God something to be grasped, right, to be held onto, but humbled himself, taking on the form of a servant, right? So again, each of these clauses is an example, when we compare it to the example of Christ, an inversion of who Christ is. The Antichrist is not someone who humbles himself and then is exalted, but someone who exalts himself as highly as anyone could ever exalt themselves, Right? With the most hubris possible is what we're getting at here. He doesn't have to go and sit on a particular spot in Jerusalem to do that, right? So then St. Paul continues, right? And he sort of comes back to this idea we saw at the beginning of verse three of the apostasia."}

Because of course, language, gender. Right. And so, yeah, that translation had restraining or restraint or restrainer. If we're going to make it more. Something more with agency. Others have like an impediment. Other English translations. And the word there that's getting translated as a restrainer or restraint or an impediment. Right. Is actually the Greek word katakon, which again, kind of means to hold, from which, again, that doesn't help you. But this is also a term that has a military usage. Katakone is used to refer to like an occupying force or a garrison of troops. Right. A stationed set of troops. And this, of course fits very much with the term apostasia, with the stihita at the end. Right. The stand. Right. So there is this occupying force. There is this. Right. Garrison that is there right now, and that then is going to. Right. In some way treat defect, at which time he'll be revealed. Now, most of the translations, as we already mentioned, have something like restraint or impediment or restrainer. When you read the Church fathers on this, they also use that kind of language when they elaborate on it. Of a restrainer or of an impediment. Right. But this is another case where. Right. Those two ideas are not, like, opposed to each other. Right. That, that. What is a. What is a garrison of troops? Do, like, why would you garrison troops in a city?"}

Yeah, one of the two. Right. Or both. Yep. Right. To keep the peace. Right. You have. You have a garrison troops there to restrain, impede certain Things from happening to block certain things from happening. Yeah, Right. So those ideas are not at odds with each other, right? So then we have this idea. So we have this imagery that St. Paul's using. We have this sort of garrison, whatever it is, that is taking this stand, right. That it has not been so that the man of lawlessness has not been revealed already. But notice he says that the mystery of lawlessness is already at work. The mystery of lawlessness is at work. This force is sort of impeding it from taking effect, but eventually it will retreat and then sort of the mystery of lawlessness will have its way and this figure will emerge."}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #069 - 2023-06-08 - Antichrist Devil's Children","start":5008.47,"end":5093.8,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Once that. That impediment is gone. Once they're gone, right. So imagine if you have this garrison of troops in a city. Someone wants to invade the city, they can't invade the city because there's this garrison of troops. But then the troops withdraw. Now they can have. At the city, right? And so this. This language of the mystery of lawlessness already being at work in the world is very much in keeping with what St. Paul says elsewhere, right? About the power of evil in the world, right? So just as a couple examples, right? Second Corinthians 4, verse 4, St. Paul refers to the God of this age, right. Doing evil. It's a way of referring to the devil as. Right. Having some kind of rulership being operational in this world. Ephesians 2, verse 2. He refers to Satan is the prince and power of the air. And of course, the language ruler of this world gets used repeatedly in St. John's Gospel in John 12:31, 14, verse 30, 16, verse 11. And that's Christ."}

Not the age to come. And so that's very much sort of the idea that St. Paul is getting at when he talks about this mystery of lawlessness already being operational. Right. But it can't sort of come to a head until this apostasia, this retreat, this breaking of camp, right. Happens, right. Literally, katakon means to. I mean, if you want to take a really literal thing of it, it's depart from the middle, right? To leave the midst. But that's this idea to break camp, to pick up and move. And you pointed out that removed, right?"}

Some translations have it, as, you know, this restrainer is removed. And the problem with that is that in 21st century English, remove is almost always used in a transitive way. And so people take it that way. Like it means that something is going to get moved out of the way by something else. But, but there's this older use, this intransitive use of remove, like I shall now remove myself to my bed, you know, that you can. Or I shall now remove, you know, meaning I'm leaving, you know, it doesn't necessarily mean someone removed me. I can remove myself, I can just leave. Yeah."}

Genesis 34, the.

Yeah. And so then when we get later into the tribe of Levi, and we've talked about this on the show before, but the tribe of Levi receives the priesthood in Exodus 32, after, in verses 26 through 29, after the episode with the golden calf, they go and slaughter 3,000 elders of the people who had been serving as priests before them, who had worshiped the golden calf. This, the golden calf episode is, of course, at the time that Moses received the Torah, received the law, making this the first Pentecost.

Yeah. As for the rest of it, I much prefer the music of Eric Zahn to anything from Brian's on. And we move on to Phineas, who we've talked about before, or penias in Numbers 25, Verses 1 through 13. He and his descendants. He's a grandson of Aaron. He and his descendants are given the high priesthood because he's the one who goes and puts the spear through the fornicating people at BAAL Paor and puts an end to the rebellion There. And a very important, though, beyond just these sort of massacres, a very important military image for these purposes, for what we're talking about here in terms of what St. Paul is doing is actually relates to Aaron, right. The original high priest, the originator of the Levitical priesthood. And this is in Numbers 16, Verses 46 through 48. Yes. Two references to the Book of Numbers in one half of the show. And this is where after the rebellion of Korah, which we've talked about before at some length. Right. Cora, remember, is the guy who shows up and says, why are Aaron and these other priests putting themselves over us? Aren't we all priests? Understand that? As you will. And then the ground swallows them up. Aaron. A plague breaks out. And Aaron is called to stand in the midst, to stand between the dying and the dead and the living with his sensor, with his incense being offered to God. And so he stands in the midst, in the middle point between life and death, to ward off and put an end to the plague. And when this is interpreted in the Book of Wisdom, which was written later in Greek, now a whole bunch of people are going to freak out because I'm saying it wasn't written by Solomon. Solomon wasn't alive in the first century AD and he didn't write in Greek. And the church fathers, the first ones who mention it, say that the Book of Wisdom was part of the New Testament. New Testament, because it was written in Greek in the first century anyway."}

For a blameless man was quick to act as their champion. He brought forward the shield of his ministry, prayer and propitiation. By incense he withstood the anger and put an end to the disaster. Showing that he was thy servant. He conquered the wrath not by strength of body and not by force of arms, but by his word. He subdued the punisher, appealing to the oaths and covenants given to our fathers. For when the dead had already fallen on one another in heaps, he intervened and held back the wrath and cut off its way to the living. For upon his long robe the whole world was depicted, and the glories of the fathers were engraved in the four rows of stones. And thy majesty on the diadem upon his head. To these the destroyer yielded. These he feared, for merely to test the wrath was enough. It's interesting the, the, you know, plague is here Depicted not as a kind of impersonal force, but as the destroyer."}

That. That wards off and. And protects. And we can see how this is integrated particularly into these traditions with the Messiah and Belial in 1 Q. Melchizedek, which is one of the Dead Sea scrolls, the number is the cave it was found in. So it's found in cave 1Q for Qumran. That lets you know it's a Dead Sea scroll. And then Melchizedek, because that's who it's about. Just to give you the References Real quick, two verses 1 through 3, 15 verses 4 through 7, and 16 verses 13 and 14, if you want to look those up. But describe Melchizedek coming as the Messiah. So Melchizedek is the messianic figure. We talked about this scroll a little bit back in the Melchizedek episode, but Melchizedek coming as the Messiah figure, and he leads an army of priests of his priest. Because Melchizedek, of course, is a priest against Belial and his armies. Right. So all of this element of the Priesthood is for St. Paul and the tradition he's received, bound up in. Right. The idea of this conflict between the Messiah and Belial, between Christ and Antichrist. Right. And so the impediment here, or the restrainer is priestly sacrifice. It's Christian worship. Put a fine point on it. It's the Eucharist. It's the offering of incense, just like it was with Aaron. Right. And you can see, as you read through second Thessalonians 2, through the whole chapter, there is this backdrop of worship. Right. Being talked about who is worshiped, what is worshiped, what is the object of piety. Right. He. St. Paul does not speak of the Antichrist here in political terms primarily. Right. It's, of course, there was no separation between politics and religion at this time. But from our perspective. Right."}

And he talks about toward the end of the Chapter how those who were not willing to accept the truth, that is the religious truth, to accept the yoke, to accept the Torah right, to accept the teaching, the, the. The. The way of being in the world that Christianity represents, that they were in rejecting, that were handed over to delusion. Right? What is that delusion? That's the mystery of lawlessness that's out there in the world. Right. What protects from it? Right. What is keeping the world going, keeping the world alive, keeping the end from coming. Right now someone may point out, if they're not on the line to do it already. Doesn't sound like it, that a number of the Church Fathers, St. John Chrysostom prominent among them, when they talk about this impediment or restrainer, they talk about the Christian monarchy that started with St. Constantine. And so some people will again come to say, oh, the fathers say that it's the Christian monarchy. And there are a lot of folks in the 20th century who took a very literal, direct interpretation of that. They said, well, the last Tsar is gone. There's no more Christian monarch. Therefore, this is the end times now the Antichrist is going to be revealed. Some of them took it very literally. That was Lenin or Stalin."}

I have another one. But my main basic question was in terms of the Antichrist and son of Belial, in the archetypal terms that you've been discussing as representing evil in its forms in the world, does that mean that when we see those forms of evil in the world, such as violence or coercive power that's abused, or, you know, manipulation, lying and so on and so forth, lawlessness, as you say, does that mean that we should understand that as the Antichrist at work in the world, and also do our scriptures tell us to expect that these things will get worse as sort of time goes on? And then I was also got interested in that you were speaking about the military, military terms. You made me think about the word legion used for the man who was occupied by a legion of demons. And in Greek, of course, you hear military terms used for angels, like taxiarchus for archangel. So I was wondering how those things are linked as well. Those are my two questions."}

I don't know, Father. Like the. Like Legion. I mean, it's. It is actually interpreted like. Like Legion says, you know, for we are many. Right. There's this explanation of why this is the name, like, this guy or two guys, depending on which gospel you're reading, possessed by a big pile of demons. But, I mean, is there a kind of inverted.

That passage we read from Wisdom is getting at that sort of the weapons of Aaron's warfare, right, against the plague, which is sort of embodied and described as this evil power, right. Is his sensor, is that incense that he's offering to God is worship. Right. And so, yeah, so there's. There's there's not a disconnect there. Right. And the. The.

You know, another thing that occurred to me when, when she mentioned possession. Right. See, I am going to use a little throw in a little old English. Yeah. Right. So. So a couple of military terms from Old English, helden, which is the ancestor of our word hold, which we still use to refer to military action of like holding the battlefield."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #069 - 2023-06-08 - Antichrist Devil's Children","start":6379.37,"end":6380.57,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Yeah. Or a building."}

It still has that sense of like occupation, but then you've also got the word weldon, which is the ancestor of our word wield, and you literally, like a king literally wields his kingdom in Old English. And. And a triumphant general wields the battlefield as well. So there's not, not just a sense of possession, but also like making use of, you know, at the same time. So, yeah, it's interesting, like how, how much deeper that sense is than, as you said, our modern notion of possession. But if you, if you again, sort of re. Literalize it back to possessing, having, holding, wielding, commanding, it all works. It all works."}

Right. So there are people who took that very literally in the early 20th century, right. That, that the last Tsar has been murdered. Lenin or Stalin. Right. Is the Antichrist now, now revealed. Now, obviously that is not panned out right. To be the case. Not that those figures weren't Antichrist. More on that in the third half. But in terms of being the right, the final, the ultimate. Right. And so, and I, I think that's from a. A slight misinterpretation of the fathers, or misinterpretation might be the wrong word. It might just be an overly literal read because I think what the fathers were getting at and the reason I think this gets read overly literally is again, a context issue. Right. So for most of the Fathers, we're talking about, even like St. John Chrysostom. St. John Chrysostom is in Constantinople, like 20 years after Christianity became the official religion of the empire. Less than 20 years, actually, when he starts, when he first goes to Constantinople, when we're talking about the saints of the 4th century, a lot of them had been alive during the period of persecution, during the final great persecutions. And so what St. Constantine's conversion to Christianity represented to them, what Theodosius represented to them is a little different than what the emperor in the 11th or 14th century or the Russian czar represented. A little different in that the. The conversion of St. Constantine and the subsequent early Christian emperors who the Fathers were dealing with represented a. A transformation and an establishment of the Christian religion as religion, meaning Christian practices, Christian worship right, in the world in a way that it had not been before, right? So already St. Constantine puts an end to pagan sacrifices in the military and puts an end to pagan sacrifices as a public work, which is what liturgy means, by the way. Public work, not the work of the people, public work done by the government, by a ministry of the government, and makes the Eucharist a public work. He makes the Eucharist liturgy by making it a public work. He. He establishes it within the military, he establishes it within the civil order. That, of course, then gets furthered by subsequent Christian emperors, Right? And so this to them is what the Christian monarchy represents to them vis a vis Christian worship. Right? The Christian mark is the guarantor that the Eucharist will continue to be served, that sacrifices will continue to be offered, incense will continue to be offered with prayers at every place, Right? Because we have this Christian monarch who is there to ensure it."}

Right? This is again, a porque no los dose. If we understand the Fathers who say this in their context, right? They're saying if the Christian monarchy goes away and persecution begins again, right. Then that persecution will begin to put a stop to the Eucharist. And if this worship of God ceases right in the world, that will bring about the time of the end, Right? That will bring about the time of the end. And especially with, as we said, and we're going to develop that a little more in the third half, also with St Paul appealing to this image of the Nephilim of these ancient God kings, right? As the image of who the Antichrist is going to be. Right. That becomes sort of the image. There is this contrast because, of course, again, those who are alive before St. Constantine's conversion saw a God king."}

And this is in living memory that there were these God kings. Right. And so if this is your image of The Antichrist. Right. St. Constantine represents a departure from that because not only did he put an end to those pagan sacrifices, he was, as the Roman emperor when he became emperor, the Pontifex Maximus, he was the high priest of the Roman religion. But not only does he not practice the pagan sacrifices himself, as would have been his duty as emperor, but he does not take any Christian ecclesiastical office for himself."}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #069 - 2023-06-08 - Antichrist Devil's Children","start":6848.06,"end":6918.67,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"He doesn't try to make himself a bishop. He never tried to serve the Eucharist. He never tried to offer incense. Right. He never even tried. Right. He separates those things from himself, even as a Christian. And so again, someone like St. John Chrysostom living at the time he lived. Right. If this Christian monarchy goes away, meaning this gets replaced by a pagan monarch. Right. We're going to be right back into this God King territory. Antichrist territory. Right. And so this makes sense, Right. In that original context. And this is why Julian the Apostate becomes the image of the Antichrist for almost all of the Church fathers. When you see the Church fathers, I mean, St. John of Damascus is a perfect example. When you read his precise exposition of the Orthodox faith and you read everything he says about the Antichrist and that the Antichrist is going to do, it's all stuff that Julian the Apostate did and tried to do."}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #069 - 2023-06-08 - Antichrist Devil's Children","start":6923.07,"end":7116.35,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"But what is Julian the Apostate? He's the pagan emperor who came along and tried to reverse what the Christian emperor had done. Yeah, Right. And so that's why they're connecting the. The Christian monarchy with the impediment. Right. So the liturgy, as anyone who's ever been to an orthodox liturgy knows, is about asking for God's mercy. Right. Because we've talked many times on the show about how justice works and injustice. Right. Justice is everything being in its place and operating correctly. Injustice is when that order gets broken, and then judgment is when that order gets restored. And sometimes it's a violent correction, right? And that for God, there is always this. You can see it like a balance scale, right? On one hand, there are the victims of evil in the world who are crying out for justice, starting with the blood of Abel, right? And the widows and the orphans in the. The souls of the martyrs crying out, how long, O Lord? Right? And then on the other hand, on the other side is God's mercy and his patience to allow people time to repent. And different language gets used for this. In the Scriptures, one of the most common is, you know, the cup of the iniquity of this people is not full yet. And then it gets full, and that scale tips, and it tips away from mercy, and it tips toward judgment, toward these things being corrected. And so nations fall, cities get destroyed by flaming meteors. Like, things happen and things are corrected. And this is true on the macro scale also. This is what St. Peter says, right? He says christ is not delaying his coming. God has not forgotten about you and all the things you're suffering in this world, but he is patient, he is merciful. He is allowing people time to repent. But the day will come for the whole world when that scale tips, and that's when the final judgment will happen. And so the reason in liturgy, we're asking for God to have mercy so much, right, Is that we're offering the liturgy, we're offering the sacrifice of the Eucharist for the life of the world and for its salvation, right? That is what is keeping this world going, right? The prayers and worship of God's people, asking him for mercy for more time to repent, for more time to make things right before the end and the judgment comes, right? And so ultimately, what St. Paul's getting at here with this idea of the impediment or the restrainer is that the end of liturgy will be the end of the world, right? That when the worship of God ceases, this is what Christ is referring to. He says, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on the earth? Right?"}

Luke 10, verse 42. Mary's choice to receive life giving words at Jesus feet hints at Martha's real need. When one's material needs consume all one's attention, nothing more will be sought after. The demands of physical life can totally colonize the mind. Jesus desired to redirect Martha's concerns toward spiritual things. She had prioritized food over him, although a bare morsel of bread in his hands could turn into lamb. Spiritual life has its own logic. And that logic tells you that if you are in need of many things and there is one who is the source of all things, you must seek that one, and the many will be provided to you. In Christ we find the mystery of sufficiency and of surplus. So if sufficiency in everything is what you desire and surplus too is, then."}

So the other New Testament author who talks about the Antichrist, this final antichrist figure, is St. John, as we just mentioned in his Apocalypse and in his first Epistle. And so I felt the need, not for speed, but wow. First Top Gun reference, to separate this out a little bit and to talk about Saint Paul first and then talk about Saint John, even though little bits of Saint John crept into Saint Paul and little bits of Saint Paul are now going to creep into Saint John. Primarily because I was educated in the Western system. No, because there is predominant now in biblical scholarship, this idea, thanks to our 19th century German friends, that there are theologies plural in the New Testament, that different, at at minimum, different authors within the New Testament. And of course, then you get into the whole issue of modern scholarship not thinking anybody wrote anything, and everything's written by different people. And even the stuff we're attributing to St. John was written by a bunch of different people, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. But at the very bare minimum, any given author, you know, St. John has this theology and St. Mark has this other theology and St. Paul has this other theology. And they're separate and they're not really commensurate. And so there's piles of presuppositions that go into this. One of them being that, you know, in the ancient world within nascent Christianity, like, no one talked to each other, but there were just all these completely independent Christian communities that did not communicate. One wonders how they became Christian in the first place, who were practicing potentially radically different things than each other. Like during the first century, I know, not like later, not like second century, third century, where you have Gnostics showing up and radical."}

I've only begun to enumerate the stupid presuppositions behind this. I'll give some dumb examples. Here's a dumb example. St. Mark's gospel does not describe Jesus birth. St. Mark's gospel begins with Christ's baptism. And so you will hear otherwise intelligent people say, well, whoever wrote Mark's gospel. Because of course, it can't be somebody named Mark. Right? As if St. Mark was famous for anything else that you would put his name on this. Anyway, you know, all the fathers go to this trouble to say, well, really, this is St. Peter's account. Right. So if St. Mark is fictional, why didn't they just call it St. Peter's gospel? But anyway, so whoever wrote Mark's gospel must have had an adoptionist Christology, must have believed that Jesus became the Messiah at his baptism, not at his birth.

There is no logical reason to think that someone could take one text written by an author or two texts, Luke, Acts, right? Let's call it two texts, Luke and Act, and say, okay, I could exhaustively determine the religious way of life of the author of this from this text. Right? We would never say that otherwise. You'd never say that about any text. I know everything this person thinks about everything, how they live their life, the whole shot based on the fact that I read this one book they wrote. And that book they wrote is probably much longer than any of the New Testament texts. So that doesn't make any sense. Right. You add to this the way in which the New Testament canon came together. Right. Which is not, as we've talked on the show before, that some guy somewhere sort of forced these books altogether into a collection, even though they disagree with each other. It's the opposite. The canon came together organically. By 151, 50 AD 150, every Christian church in every major city of the Roman Empire was using the four Gospels and only the four Gospels. There was no Christian emperor compelling them. No one was out there burning other books. Nobody was forcing it. It happened organically. And guess what? They could read. They weren't stupid.

Just doesn't happen. So what accounts for these sometimes differences or different ways of using words or different terms being used, like the term Antichrist being used by St. John in one place, not in another and not by St. Paul. What we have to realize is that not just the text of the New Testament. I've hammered on this with the text of the New Testament, but all writing, everything that any human has ever written is occasional. It is written at a point in time for a purpose with an intended readership. Right. When I write a grocery list, right. Which I don't. My wife does. But were I to be the one to write the grocery list, it would be shorter, more boring, and the food would not be nutritious. But also. Right. I would. I would be writing it in response to a certain need. I need food to eat for the next week, right? And therefore I would try to put together a list of food that should I eat that food over the next week, I would be nourished, satisfied, what have you. Right. I would list foods that were to my taste and leave out ones that weren't. I would write it in a way, right? And Father Andrew could attest to this because he has seen like show outlines I've written in a way that would probably be intelligible only to me, right? Like just weird words and phrases that were evocative, but that would remind me of something, Right. Because my intended audience is not someone else to read my grocery list and understand it. It's just me, right? So all that would be true, my grocery list. All of that is also true of St. Paul's Epistle to the Romans. He wrote it in a particular time with particular things happening in the world to the Christian community in the city of Rome to answer certain questions and deal with certain problems they were having. Yet an intended audience used language that he believed they would understand in their time and place to convey to them the things that he wanted to communicate to them. It's true of every other text in the New Testament. Every other text in the New Testament. So St. John is writing to a different community in a different place at a different time, dealing with different issues than the issues that St. Paul was writing to Thessalonica to address. So they can refer to the same traditions, the same ideas, right? The same teachings regarding the Antichrist figure. But because they have different audiences at different times, at different places, right? They can use different language and emphasize different parts and elements of that tradition and different ways of coming at that tradition. And they're not disagreeing with each other. They're not presenting two different theologies. They're presenting the same thing, right? And so this is the extra step of interpretation that's required in interpreting anything, any writing, right? Is the first step of interpretation is contextual, getting at, as best we can, that original ear, the original recipients, what they were dealing with, how this addressed it, right? And then there's this other step where we take it and we apply it for our purposes, right? This is what you see the Fathers doing with Scripture, right? They take something that St. Paul wrote to one community for a particular purpose. And then St. John Chrysostom looks at what St. Paul did, right? And what he communicated to the community he was writing to. And St. John goes and he says the same thing, homiletics, tries to convey the same thing, the same Christ, right, Ultimately to the people he's preaching to in Antioch or in Constantinople, and does a fabulous job of it because he's St. John Chrysostom, right? But we can no more go and just quote St. John than we could just go and quote St. Paul, right? When we interpret St. John Chrysostom, we have to do the same thing. We have to say, what is he conveying? How is he conveying Christ, ultimately, who Christ is to the people he's preaching to? And how can I communicate that same thing to the person I'm talking to in, you know, southern Louisiana in the 21st century? And the language I use is probably going to be. It's not going to be Greek, right? Like which I use is going to be different than St. John's and St. Paul's right? But if I'm doing it right, I'm not going to be contradicting them. I'm not going to be doing something different. Right. And so this is how we have to understand these things. So all of this is me taking a bunch of shots at modern biblical studies. And. But also to say that St. John and St. Paul are not teaching something different on this. Right. But they are writing in different circumstances, different genres, even in the case of the Book of Revelation. And so they're focusing on and conveying different elements of the tradition that they're, that they're referring to and that they're sort of synthesizing in a Christian way and then teaching. So, okay, that. That clears mud, but it covers the ground tribute."}

Okay. Specifically the beast out of the sea in Revelation 13. But what St. John is doing there in his vision, Right. Is that there is a sort of. I mean, this is a vision St. John receives. But again, St. John is a person who is steeped in Old Testament prophecy and prophetic imagery. So when he has his vision, God communicates through that vision with him using the imagery of Old Testament prophecy that's familiar to him. Right. And so we have to take a look at the beasts in Daniel briefly before we get to the beast. Right, the beast of beasts, the super beast in. In Revelation 13. Okay. And Daniel's beasts, of course, he sees this succession of beasts in Daniel 7. This is actually the story of the beast surrounds the story of the enthronement of the Son of Man that we've talked about a bunch before on the show. So we're not going to get back into that here. We'll talk about the beast part briefly. And what you have there is this succession of beasts that are these sort of amalgamations of animal forms that represent a succession of empires. Babylon, Persia, Greece and Rome. And it's sort of parallel to the vision of the statue that Daniel interprets for Nebuchadnezzar with the statue made of the different metals. Right. Same kind of idea. You can especially see some of this symbolism with Greece and the horns and Alexander. Alexander on coins has rams horns, which was a way of portraying him as divine.

And Interestingly, in Daniel 7, even though they're defeated when the Son of Man is enthroned, they're only finally sort of destroyed and punished after a time.

These are almost every title that's ascribed to Christ in the New Testament. Was a title of Caesar. So blasphemous names. But the blasphemous name thing really started with all the way back with the Selucids, who, you know, we're. We're familiar with maybe Antiochus IV Epiphanes. Right. Who did the abomination of desolation. But Epiphanies there was that he was the manifestation of a God. Right. And Savior Soter was another common title. His. I think it was his father might have been his grandfather who had so terre. One of the Ptolemies had so terr. Right. This. This was a common thing. And Caesar had just kind of balled all of those up and taken them all for him. Right. From all of those previous rulers. So clearly St. John is talking about Rome, but again, he's talking about more than just Rome. Right. Rome is sort of a prime example of what he's talking about. Rome was the current. The contemporary example at the time. St. John has this vision of what he's talking about.

So folks may be familiar with, if they've dipped their toes in the biblical studies stuff a little bit, that the earliest manuscripts we have of Revelation, which are not that early, by the way, but the earliest ones we have actually have 616 or 616 instead of 666. And, you know, people get worked up about it because they like to find things to get worked up about. But what's going on here is that this is what's called Gematria. This is using numbers to represent letters, right. Which comes about as a reverse of what was normally done. As we talked about on the show before, normally they didn't have numerals. So they use letters to represent numbers. Right. And so this is the way of using those letter numbers to represent other letters. It's a way of encoding something. And the fact that he's encoding something, St. John kind of telegraphs because he's like, let the reader understand, you know, it is the number of a man. Right, Wink, Right. So it's kind of obvious to everyone, anyone reading it, that this is something encoded. So Saints Irenaeus and Saint Hippolytus say that this is encoded. Teitan or Titan or Typhon in both cases. And for both figures, both of these fathers, this is clearly like trying to draw it back to the Nephilim story, right? Because of course, the Titans are taken to be, if we see the story of the Titans as pro devil propaganda, they're taken to be the angels who sinned, right. As being the equivalent of like the watchers in the Book of Enoch. Who. And who takes it that way? Well, St. Peter takes it that way, right. St. Peter talks about the angels imprisoned in Tartarus, which is the place where the Titans were imprisoned. He's the only author who uses the word Tartarus in the New Testament. So that's who the Titans were. Typhon is probably a little less well known. Typhon is. So after the imprisonment of the Titans, the defeat imprisonment of the Titans by the Olympians, Gaia, who's technically one of the sort of an Ur Titan, the Earth. Gaia gets mad. And first she brings forth the giants to attack to get revenge for the Titans on the Olympians, leading to the Greek Gigantomachy. And then sort of her final step after the defeat of the giants is to bring forth Typhon, who is this giant monster beast who's an amalgamation of all these different animal forms that comes up out of the Mediterranean Sea to kill Zeus to get revenge. Right. So either Typhon or Titan, we're connecting this back to Greek versions of the Nephilim story, right. And you can see how Typhon would connect to a beast out of the sea too. Yeah, right. And so we're associating in this case Rome and Rome's king, right? Caesar, with, you know, who presented himself as a God and add these blasphemous names with the Nephilim, right. In the Old Testament. So those fathers are not wrong. That is an association that's happening here. Right. But I think you could make a very good case that the gematria is way more specific than that. And to me, the clincher for this is the fact that this makes sense of both numbers. This works for 666 and616. Right. So the. The Greek form of the name for Nero Caesar, Right. In. In Hebrew or Aramaic, is. These are transliterated into English is N, R, O, N, Q, S, R. That's the standard English transliteration of the Hebrew consonants. And the one long vowel, which is."}

Right. That gives you the gematri on that is 666. If you drop that extra nun so that it matches the Latin consonants in Hebrew and aramaic, you get 616. So that works for both. So the idea here is that St. John is not just using Rome as the contemporary image for what he's talking about, but he's using a particular Caesar, Nero, the Caesar who killed saints Peter and Paul and lots of other Christians, is using him as, again, an emblematic person."}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #069 - 2023-06-08 - Antichrist Devil's Children","start":9660.48,"end":9875.66,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Around 80, 88. So not long before this vision. Dio Chrysostom. Chrysostom was a title that was given to St. John. It was given to other people too. Dio Chrysostom is a pagan, pagan, Roman. But in his Discourse 21, he refers to this. The Sibylline Oracles 4 and 5 refer to this. Tacitus refers to this in Histories 2, 8. Suetonius refers to this in Section 57. Right. So this is attested. This was a belief, and it's only attested by this. But historically there were phony Neros who showed up and tried to claim the imperial throne in Rome in this period. And thereafter, people showed up claiming to be Nero. Right. Coming back. And this tradition was so pervasive and so entrenched in Roman thought that it was still around in St. Augustine's Day. St. Augustine in City of God 20193 says that as the Western empire was collapsing in the early 5th century, there were a lot of barely converted pagans who said, oh, Christianity was a mistake. That's why the Western empire is falling and Nero is going to come back and rescue us and make the empire pagan again and turn all this around. Right. So again, in the same way that Julian the apostate ended up being sort of the image or the icon or the emblematic figure of the Antichrist for a lot of the Fathers in late antiquity, Nero here is presented by St. John and becomes for generations of Christians thereafter, especially in the west, the image of the Antichrist. Right. In the same kind of way. Right. And again, the way St. John describes it and the way these people up to St. Augustine describe it is Nero is going to reappear, Right. And you can compare that to the language St. Paul uses in second Thessalonians 2, where both Christ appears, right? What we would call a second Advent, second coming, and the man of lawlessness appears, right. And Nero appears is going to reappear, Right. And so this idea that the Antichrist is going to have be someone who does a counterfeit resurrection, right? He's going to be this God King figure who does a fake, a phony resurrection, sort of a parody of Christ's actual resurrection. Right. You can see how that becomes an archetypal image. But of course, St. John is not saying, oh, Nero's the final Antichrist, and then that, you know, that's it. Either this is going to happen soon or he's going to come back as the Antichrist at some point in the future. He's not identifying him as the, the final Antichrist. And how do we know that? Well, we know that because of how St. John talks about the, the Antichrist in First John where he actually uses the Word, Right, yeah, Yep, yep. And what he says there is very consonant with what St. Paul talks about, with the mystery of lawlessness. Right. That is already at work in the world. Right. And already impinging."}

The idea being they're actually the works of the devil. Right. And he is doing them. He is bringing them into reality in the world. He is cooperating with Satan. Right. Rather than cooperating with God. And this is the perspective that St. John has in First John, in First John 3, verses 8 through 12, from Cain on, uses Cain as the archetypal sinner from Canaan. These Antichrist figures, they do the works of the devil in the world. And Christ comes to destroy those works. Right. Christ comes to destroy those works.

But he was the king of Israel. One could make positive typology between him and Christ at certain points in his life and in certain stories about his life, fathers do the whole thing about going and finding his father's donkeys and stuff. Right. So. Right. Someone can at times and places be an image of Christ and even, dare I say, it can even be a Christian. Right. And unfortunately apostatized to bring this back full circle. Right. So typology and the person's salvation or the person's relationship as person with God are not one to one. So you can have a saint like Adam where there's a negative typology, a negative comparison between him and Christ in certain ways, but is still a saint, ends up being a saint. And you can have other figures who I won't name because there's been enough of that on the Internet. That's who, in some ways might have served as a positive type of Christ. I mentioned Saul. I guess we'll do that one. But who do not end up being saints themselves. Right. Even though at times in certain elements of their story may have this positive typology related to Christ. Right, but this is, this is at the core of something we've talked about, we talked about early on in the show actually, of seeing myth and religious practice, right, outside of ancient Israel, outside of Second Temple Judaism, outside of Christianity, seeing these as pro devil propaganda, right, that these are not just random, unrelated stories that are piffles and can be dismissed, right, as silly fables, but nor are they the truth, right, that we have within that tradition throughout history that I just described, right. They feature inversions of the truth, distortions of the truth, bendings of the truth. Right? And this is how, when you take a nuanced view of how the Fathers read Homer or Plato or whomever, right, this is what you actually see, right? They're saying this emerges from the actual world, which includes the spiritual world, right? And is a description of it and is a description of events in it, but it's one that's warped. It's one that sometimes outright inverted, flipped 180 degrees, flipped in like photo negative. But even from those images, if you understand them and how to work with them, you can show how they represent and connect back to and can help illuminate the truth. And so they're neither discarded nor embraced, right. Nor just sort of cherry picked. Well, here are the nice parts and we'll put out the expurgated bowdlerized version without all the naughty bits. And that'll be the Christian version, right. But a much more nuanced way of interacting, right, with it."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #069 - 2023-06-08 - Antichrist Devil's Children","start":10623.51,"end":11198.95,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Yeah, yeah. So to sum up some of my final thoughts, you know, I was raised as a conservative evangelical Protestant. And especially in the period of, you know, 1970s and 80s and 90s, that means a lot of dispensationalism. You know, you really can't get away from it. We don't need to go into exactly what dispensationalism is. I mean, you can look it up on the interwebs, but a major piece of it is this idea that, you know, the end of the world is at hand. And I remember books like late Great Planet Earth from Hal Lindsay in the 70s, and I think he didn't, didn't that book predict that the end of the world would be like 1988? I think that's what it was. It did not end in 1988. But I mean, there's been millenarian fervor like this in many periods in history. You know, the one in the 19th century that ended up being called the Great Disappointment by the Millerites. And one of the things that you often see happen when people have millenarian fervor, like the sense that the world is ending. And I think a lot of people these days do have this sense. I mean, there's all kinds of just nutty stuff happening and, and not just nutty stuff. There's a lot of dangerous, violent stuff happening, right? And, and a lot of folks, they put all these things together and they'll say, this is. This is it, this is it. You know, and they may even attempt to identify particular figures as being the Antichrist. You know, the signs are all lining up, you know, and all this kind of thing. I think my favorite millenarianist I've seen on the. Or millenarian I've seen on. On the interwebs lately is a guy who calls himself the third eagle of the Apocalypse. His. His music is really catchy. And with this idea that the world is ending, a lot of times people get this sense that the rules change as a result. I mean, if you think that the world is ending, it's true. You. You tend to lose some of your inhibitions. You tend to. Everything's hyped up, you know, your feelings are stronger about things. You become more fervent or more depressed or whatever. And I mean, this works both on the. The macro level where you think the world is ending and also just the level where your world is ending. Like if your life is falling apart, there's this sense that the rules don't really apply or that the rules change. You know, like, look, we're all. Everything's about to lose everything. So therefore we've got to really focus on X, Y and Z and the normal restraints, you know, don't apply. And I've even seen this to our shame within some orthodox circles these days, right? There's this idea out there. We live in the time of Antichrist, and so therefore we don't have to be obedient to bishops. So here's the thing about all that, that is just utterly ignorant of Scripture. As we saw what St. John said, you know, Antichrists have come. Spirit of Antichrist is at work in the world. And he wrote this almost 2,000 years ago, right? And even this idea that's out there, you know, we don't really have to be obedient to bishops because the time of the Antichrist is here. Like I read one person saying this when someone, for instance, was mentioning the ecclesiology of Saint Ignatius of Antioch, which he talks very clearly about obedience to bishops. I mean, there's one point where he even says, you know, if someone is Works apart from the bishop. He worships the devil. Like, it's really strong language. And, you know, they'll say, well, Ignatian Ecclesia, ecclesiology doesn't really apply anymore because we're in the time of Antichrist. But St. Ignatius was a disciple of the Apostle John, who said those things about Antichrists already coming and the spirit of Antichrist already in the world. So in other words, he talked about his ecclesiology during a time that his own teacher said was a time of Antichrist. Right. So it wasn't like, well, everything is great, you know, and, and Christians are free and everything. Like, it was a really bad time for Christianity. Nations himself wrote this as he was on his way to be martyred. Right, but, but, you know, even aside from just this question of whether we should obey bishops or not in the time of Antichrist, obviously the, the general answer to that is yes, if a bishop tells you to do something sinful, you don't do it. That's always been true. But they don't lose all their authority because it's a time of Antichrist. Because here's the thing, Episcopal authority is set up within the time of Antichrist, which has been the case for 2,000 years now. But the broader question, the broader issue of, you know, should I behave differently because this is the time of Antichrist? The answer is no, or yes. But here's what way. Yes, if we really understand what it means that we're in the time of Antichrist, understanding that that's been the case for 2000 years now or more, depending on how you, you know, whether you're applying it even to Old Testament stuff, which clearly is a thing, then that being at work in the world, the way that you fight back against that is by the life of faithfulness, by the life of prayer and worship and kindness and love and almsgiving and fasting and all of these things that we know are the weapons of the spiritual war. Right. Sometimes people feel like a time of Antichrist means it's time to get crazy. It's a time to. To be extreme, a time to. To. To be nasty to other people. Right. You know, because, because when you have a feeling that the world is ending, people can get very agitated. But the call is the same. You know, even if, like, the final Antichrist is alive in the world today and at work in the world today, and like, this is the, the truly the last generation, the call to Christians is the same as it was when the New Testament was written. It's the same it has not changed. There is no called. Like. Like, different rules apply now, or the old rules don't apply anymore. That is not true. That is not true. The call to faithfulness is the same. We still have to love. We still have to give alms. We still have to be faithful in prayer and worship, fasting and all these things. Like, this is still the norm. It's been the norm. I think, you know, one of the things that we talked about was the idea that the liturgy in. In a sense, holds back the end of the world. That's. That really summarizes a lot of what I'm trying to say here, is that. That what is the task? It's to enter into worship. It's to enter and. And then all the things that flow from worship and realize that our task as a church is to try to rescue our fellow humans, to bring them into the church. Not to say, well, it's the time of Antichrist, and so you're all my enemies, so it's okay for me to blast you and be nasty to you and not care about the salvation of your soul or think that being nasty is caring about the salvation of someone's soul. It's not, you know, if we're going to be like the saints, then we need to be like the saints. We need to behave the way that they behaved and don't just pick out the parts that appeal to us. Like, oh, I love it when they're polemical. Like, no, that's. Actually, they only entered into that when they really felt that they needed to, and they were defending actual undermining of the body of the Church. The rules are still the same. The life of faithfulness is still the same because it was formulated in the time of Antichrist. So, yeah, we're in the time of Antichrist. I'm not saying it's not going to end tomorrow. The world's not going to end tomorrow. I don't know, it might. But the rules today are still the same as they were 2,000 years ago. And if the world doesn't end tomorrow, this will be the same next week. It's still the same. So we don't need to get agitated because Christ said, be of good cheer, for I have overcome the world. That's peace. That's. That's joy. And Christians should be known for their peace, their joy, their genuine love for each other, for other people. So rules are the same. Keep living the right way. Become more faithful. Father, your final thoughts?"}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #069 - 2023-06-08 - Antichrist Devil's Children","start":11201.27,"end":11446.43,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Yeah, so I never had to dispense with dispensationalism because I never really. And I wasn't surrounded by a lot of people playing pin the tail on the Antichrist, though I was aware of it right out there in evangelical culture. For the record, all those people who have picked Antichrist throughout history, almost all of them were right. Yeah, sure, not about which one was the final one, but most of the people they picked, you know, Hitler, Stalin, Lenin, Napoleon, Ronald Wilson Reagan, who had six letters in each of his three names. Think about it. But most, most of them, most of them were actually right. And this is because, right, as St. Paul said, the mystery of lawlessness, as St. John said, the mystery or the spirit of Antichrist is out there in the world and is active. And unfortunately, the reaction most of us take to this, at least in the contemporary period, at least in the United States, which is where I happen to live, so I can only speak from my own experience, is not to stand. Not to stand as a garrison or a bulwark in any sense, but to hunker down, to go and hide. Past generations of Christians have interacted with a culture that was full of sin and corruption brought about by the same spirit of Antichrist, by producing works of beauty, poetry, art, works of fiction and nonfiction, learning by interacting critically with their culture and society, exposing falsehoods, teaching and promoting the truth in ways that have transformed cultures in various places. And the closest we can get, especially in the US is fighting a lame culture war, which is, hey, let's have a boycott so that this cheap Belgian beer stops putting gay people in their ads and goes back to women in bikinis. Christian values, right? That. That's our idea of, oh, yeah, we're gonna. We're gonna fix the culture. We need the dog on the boogie board again in the beer commercial. Then, then everything will be great. Or maybe, you know, big horses and a big American flag. We think we're, you know, fighting some kind of culture war when we buy our chicken sandwich at one restaurant rather than another. And it's frankly pathetic. We've surrendered. We've given up on teaching or putting out or producing anything of value or anything of worth to anyone, but maybe our own, our own communities. And that's not what our forebears in the faith did. Even in much more hostile environments, when faced with a paganism that had dominated the world, the worship of demons, sexual immorality, pederasty as a cultural institution in the Roman Empire, right, Christians went and took those pagans own works, reinterpreted them and showed them the lies, taught them the truth."}

They didn't hunker down, they didn't hide, right? And so I think as Father Andrew said, we are now as we have in every other age, been living in the spirit age of the spirit of Antichrist, where the mystery of lawlessness is at work in the world. But we've been called to be this garrison. We've been called to stand and to fight to ward that off, not to ward that off from our small insular community, not to cover our kids eyes so they don't see it, to ward it off from the world, the earth, the world. That's what we're called to do. And we saw tonight from scripture what the weapons of our warfare are. Their worship, they are prayer, their kindness in the world. But they're also teaching, they're also interacting with things critically and publicly and seriously, seriously, not just again picking sides in the dum dum culture war, but seriously interacting, right, and doing this in public with real actual people in the world who we can meet and talk to and break bread with. Because you're not, you as a person are not called to do this for the whole world. We as a church spread throughout the world are called to do this for the whole world. You're called to do this in your world, your corner of it. Those people who you can see not on the Internet, not on social media, where you virtue signal or piety signal or whatever, the actual humans who are available to you to sit down and break bread with, to have a discussion with, to talk about the ideas they've imbibed from the world around them. Maybe where some of those are wrong, maybe where some of them are 180 degrees wrong, inverted from the truth, maybe where some of them are just a little bent and we can straighten them out, right, and bring them to come to know Christ. Because as, as beleaguered, and this is frankly kind of pathetic to American Christians thinking they're so beleaguered and persecuted compared to our brothers and sisters in other parts of the world. But as believers, you may feel we don't actually want the end to come. I still need time to repent, a lot more of it than I'll probably get because I would need, I'd need to live to be 180, but to even make a good start. But we need more time to repent. There are people out there who are still lost, who need to come to know Christ. And so I don't want the end to come yet. But to do that, we're going to have to stand in the midst, not off in a corner, not hiding. And we're going to have to intervene and we're going to have to take a stand and we're going to have to do the messy business of getting to know our fellow human beings in the little world that God has placed us in to bring it to him in Christ. So those are my thoughts."}
