The modern world doesn't acknowledge, but is nevertheless haunted by spirits, angels, demons and saints. In our time, many yearn to break free of the of a flat secular materialism, to see and to know reality as it truly is. What is this spiritual reality like? How do we engage with it? Well, how do we permeate everyday life with spiritual presence? Orthodox Christian priests Father Andrew Stephen Damick and Fr. Stephen DeYoung host.

My question is about the third fall, the third angelic fall. So obviously the first fall, the devil fell through envy. That's pretty easy to kind of understand. And the second fall with the Watchers, that's also parsable. Like, I can kind of draw sort of a clear narrative of what the watchers were told to do and then what they did and how they fell into error in the third fall having to do with the angels that fell at the Tower of Babel. I find that really interesting, really curious. But the thing about it that I find hard to understand is how they fell into error. Like, I guess I don't understand exactly what caused them to do the opposite of what their job was as compared to the other two. And then as a sort of corollary to this second part is, since they fell at that point in time, why don't angels fall in that way now? If it's. If it's simply that they were given a job and then they failed to do that job, what causes them to not fall now? Thank you very much. Love the show. Bye."}

I think that. Why did they fall? It's interesting to me because, like, on the one hand, you could just say, well, we don't know what it's like to be an angel, which is probably kind of the short answer. But on the other hand, I don't know. And I wish we had Aaron to further interrogate about this question. Why would the first two."}

Well, yeah, I mean, in terms of that, that's what the Devil wanted. Right. As we've talked about, this is the goal, as I've said before a few times. Right. Like, you're going to make God not be God anymore, and you're going to be God. What's step one? That's not a thing. That's not remotely possible. You're a creature, just like the Devil is. So when we talk about the devil trying to exalt himself above God and this kind of thing we're talking about in the hearts of humans, that's his strategy for destroying humans. So what the devil wanted to do were saying these that are now demonic powers were essentially offered."}

Like when we say that those three points are when those angels fell, what we really mean is that's when their fall entered into the realm of human experience."}

My name is Christian and I'm a Roman Catholic friend from Utah with a question regarding the knowledge of the saints as persons. I have strong devotions to particular saints and I've tried to make their spirits, the guiding spirits in my family's life and my own, over and against demonic spirits, as you have encouraged. When learning about some saints lives or reading their works, I sometimes think to myself, I totally understand this fire and intensity she has in her letters to these people. Other times, I pick up personality traits from a saint's life that I don't readily understand. For example, one may quickly be drawn to the intensity of St. John Chrysostom sermons, but not the humor of St. Philip Neri, a 16th century saint in the Catholic tradition. Father Stephen examined the difference between the experience of an actual person and the concept of that person in earlier episodes. He also said many of the ills of today's world come from the lack of incarnational relationships. In light of this, can we truly come to know the saints as actual persons, or do we merely know them as concepts? I have affection for all saints, but some more than others. Kind of like Father Andrew with his kids. Why is this? Is what I'm describing like a man getting to know a love interest over text messaging for six months and coming to find out she's nothing like what he believed her to be when he finally meets her? Or do the spirits of the saints work in a fundamentally different way than that? Do relics bridge these gaps? Or do my questions about personality just come bearing too many modern presuppositions? Thank you, fathers, and God bless you."}

So, yeah, limerence is when you interact and focus on your concept of a person far more than or sometimes often to the exclusion of the actual person. Right. So a great example, I mean, Christian gave the example of a guy getting into a relationship with a girl over text messages and then meeting her. Right. This is a classic kind of example, although text messaging is still an actual interaction, but it leaves so much space to fill in that someone creates a limerent image of somebody, a kind of similar chrome in their minds. And this happens a lot in personal relationships, particularly close ones, particularly like romantic relationships or friendships, whatever. Like you're not the person I thought you were. Right. And often a lot of friction relationships comes when the person doesn't behave according to the limerent image that we have of them in our heads. Right. And I think that this is another way of describing what a number of the neptic fathers of the monastic tradition mean when they say not to have images of God in our heads when we're praying, you know, because it means then that you're just interacting with who you think God is and not with God. You have, in all these cases, like when you interact with a limerent image, you are trying to limit the freedom of the other person. Right. This is who I think you are. Now, on some level we can't escape that. Right. Like when you have an encounter with someone you already know, you come in with a concept of that person based on your previous experience with them. But it's not all based on your previous experience. A lot of it is based on what you think about them and what you want them to be. Right. You know, and it's a kind of a straw manning of the person. And so you can't completely escape it. You're going to come in with some of that. The question is how much of that is actual knowledge based on real experience and how much of it is this image you've created in your head. And so I think that this does apply to the way that we interact with saints. I don't think that the fact that we have concepts of saints is bad in and of itself, but I think that if we don't interact with them in the way that the church gives, then we're allowing that concept to get in the way and it could be bad. You know, like you could, like, for instance, some people quote, unquote, use saints for certain purposes. Right. Like, oh, well, this saint is the patron of this. This saint is the patron of that. And so therefore, that's my interaction with them. I'll pull this lever that does this thing, you know, never mind actually venerating them as persons or getting to know their life or anything like that. They're the saint that's for this. You know, like there's an app for that. There's a saint for that. Right. That is definitely a kind of limerent approach to the saints. Absolutely. And now maybe someone's introduced to saints through that kind of thing. Okay, but let's get beyond that. And just like when you have a limerent image of your spouse or friends or whatever. Okay, but get beyond that. Have some humility, be ready for them to surprise you and be okay with that. Right. God certainly acts in surprising ways sometimes, and so do his saints, and all humans do. So that's my way of parsing through that question."}

So when you're dealing with a saint from late antiquity, like St. John Chrysostom, the image of St. John Chrysostom, and by that I mean both literally, like the literal icon of St. John Chrysostom and the image from the writings that are preserved by the church, which is not all of them, is pretty close to St. John Chrysostom and the Resurrection, because the guidance of the Holy Spirit over time through history has been kind of a filter, revealing to U.S. st. John Chrysostom in the Resurrection. But with more recent saints, human history has preserved a lot more of their life and so is a less reliable guide, meaning modern saints, we tend to have somewhat unfiltered. We have in some cases a huge volume of things that they said."}

And so there is what is at least not the orthodox view of authority, which is the idea that because this person is a saint, everything they ever said, everything they ever wrote, everything they ever did is, like, directly inspired by God and equally valuable. Right. And from an orthodox perspective, of course, we can't believe that because that would require every saint to be infallible and perfect, which we don't believe is the case. Right. And those saints, if you went back in time and talked to them, would have been the first ones to tell you they weren't infallible or perfect. So that's not how that works. Right. Even with saints, they're saints because there's a lot more gold than the other. But there's still the other. You know, I've said talking about St. Paul, because people ask about St. Paul, it's all, well, hey, if we found like, the letter to the Laodiceans or something, would we add it to the Bible? And I'm like, no, like, St. Paul's shopping list was not inspired once he wrote it down. Right. Like, this isn't something that affixes to the person. This is something that remains with the Holy Spirit. So in a certain way, it's because we have more information about more modern saints, it could be harder to form a relationship with them."}

I've listened to every episode and it has had a profound positive effect on me. And yes, I am reading something that I wrote out. I'm having questions about Fr. Stephen's vision of 21st century Jews converting en masse and of them creating Torah keeping Orthodox Christian communities, which, if I understand Fr. Stephen correctly, would have been the most appropriate things for Jewish Christians to have done in the first century and indeed maintained. One of the first things that drew me to orthodoxy 35 years ago was the seamless integration of Old and New Testament in our lives. I've always seen Orthodoxy as a single unbroken religion that began with Adam and Eve. Leaving aside the issue of Father Stephen convincingly making the case that the conversion of the Gentiles is the gathering up of the lost ten tribes of Israel who were certainly commanded to keep the Torah. I have seen studies showing that ancient Christian communities in Palestine appear to be descendants of the first Jewish converts to Christianity, kept socially and genetically isolated. And yet the liturgical and ascetical lives of those ancient Christian families do not appear to differ from those of other ancient Christian communities. Did their Jewish Christian forebears get it wrong somewhere along the way? I'd appreciate your thoughts."}

Would you tell them to stop keeping the other commandments that were directed toward Israel if they had been keeping them all their lives? Right?

But from my perspective, right, I don't see anything in Scripture or in our tradition that says that we would tell those people to stop doing those things, right? Because that's something very clearly. St. Paul of the other apostles did not tell Jewish Christians. They did not tell them to stop doing those things. That's what St. Paul was accused of over and over again, but he vehemently, over and over and over again, denied it. So unless you want to call St. Paul a liar, right, which when I have discussions about this with Jewish people, they do, by the way, they say, no, St. Paul was a liar. St. Paul was telling Jews not to do those things anymore. And then when he got called on the COVID about it, he lied. That's not my perspective of St. Paul.

Because who knows, maybe en masse, there's, they would say, you know, we're ready to eat pork on Pasca. Right. I don't know. I mean, I, I always am, but I, I don't know what it's like to be, you know, a kosher keeping Jew. So, you know. Yeah. And you know, it's, it's just interesting. I mean, this issue of, of Palestinian genetics, I know that's been brought up by a lot of people and has a lot of kind of political implications for the modern moment, but the reality is that it's not like Jews and Palestinians, whether they are Christians or Muslims living in Israel, have some concept that, okay, we're actually all really the same thing. They definitely see each other as different communities. And so it's interesting how much that demonstrates what you've talked about, which is that, like, genetically, there is no concept of genetics in the scriptures in the ancient world, even though genetically, the populations that live in Israel are apparently pretty similar to each other, but they clearly have different religious communities that don't just define, like, you know, whether they go to a church, temple or synagogue or mosque, but really are their community. You know, the people that they're with, they're the people that they marry, the languages that they speak, all of that stuff, you know, it's. It's all together. The way they dress. I mean, it's all together kind of in one ball. So I think it's actually a great example, you know, of how that really, really works. So. Good question. All right, well, we've got one from Gillian who wonders about, frankly, different translations. She's heard of the Nicene Creed."}

My name is Gillian, and I'm phoning from Romania. I used to be a Catholic, and when I was a Catholic, I was in the uk, and we used to say the Creed. And the priest added a word to the creed. No, not that one. He added another word to the Creed, so that the Creed said, and was crucified under Pontius Pilate, suffered, died, and was buried. Now, I can't unhear that. So whenever I hear the Creed in English now, I hear the word died. Luckily, I don't get that in Romania because I hear it in Romanian and it's fine. But it got me thinking. Why is the death of Christ left out of the Creed? There must be some very good reasons for it, but I can't think of any. So if you could enlighten me about that, I'd be very grateful. Thank you."}

So you can be, you know, precise about this. I actually looked. Looked this up because I was. I kind of wondered, is this a difference between the Latin and the Greek? And it's not. Actually. The passage in Latin and the passage in Greek are exactly parallel. Suffered and was buried. Now, there are translations of the Latin version that get translated as suffered death and was buried. But literally, what it says in the Latin is simply suffered, passus et sepultus est, just as in the Greek, it is que pathonda che taffenda, and suffered and was buried. Right. I think that. I don't think of it as an omission. I think it's simply referencing the story as it's Told in the Scriptures. Right. That the whole event of his suffering and death is called his passion. His suffering. Right. What do you think? I mean, obviously, Gillian is just noticing that there are these translations out there, but they're not literal, Gillian. They're not literal of at least whatever they're translating from. Very likely. I don't know. Do you know of a father. Do you know of a variant that actually includes died in. In the. The Creed?"}

Right. That's not the original meaning of that word. And it's not the original meaning of pathi. Right. Pathi is related to passive passions. Right. We talk about the passion of Christ. Right. And so the idea is Christ suffered a whole series of things. He suffered exclusion, alienation. He suffered false accusations. He suffered beatings and scourgings. He suffered crucifixion, and then he suffered death. Right. These are all things that were inflicted upon him which he voluntarily accepted. Right. So his death is included in suffered. Right. That is the culmination of the things that he suffered. And it's just that the meaning of suffering has shifted a little bit over time, just like the meaning of passion has shifted. Oh, yeah, right. The way it's commonly used in English now to refer to desire, often sexual desire, you know, whereas, like in the movie title, the Passion of the Christ, it very clearly is not referring to that. Right. It's referring to his suffering. Right. So these. Some of these words have shifted and suffering has just grown sort of more precise. Right. But think about older turns of phrase in English, like that person doesn't suffer fools gladly."}

My name is Joachim. I live in Utah. And I just wanted to thank you for truly opening our eyes to see the unseen world, to recognize that there is no veil or separation between the spiritual and physical world, that we can see God and live, and that we don't need things like species 8000, 472 or wormhole aliens to experience a fuller world, but that the world truly is filled with spirits, angels, demons, and saints. My question to both of you is in regards to Four Kingdoms, chapter 13, verse 21. When a dead man falls on the bones of the prophet Elisha, then is resurrected. Are Elisha's relics performing miracles because Elisha himself is experiencing the resurrection at that point? If so, does that mean. And does that really prove what you've been saying all along, that time and space isn't really a thing since Elisha experienced the resurrection spiritually, even though the events of the New Testament happen until hundreds of years later?

Bringing someone back from the dead? Is this related to Elisha experiencing the resurrection? I mean, short answer, yes. Right. That's why relics, I don't want to use this word, but it's the only word I can come up with work is they are the resurrection. You know, people who have experienced the resurrection of the soul, that, that is having an effect on the, on their, their bodies, their material bodies that still remain. Although it's just partial, you know, from our point of view. I think, for instance, I mean the, the most vivid experience of that I've ever had is venerating the, the hand of St. Mary Magdalene, which is not only incorrupt, but such that it's even flexible, but is actually still warm, which is a little unnerving to experience. But you know, there you are. Right. That, that is a thing. So yeah, I mean at that, from our point of view, right. At that point in human history, Elisha is still in Hades and yet God is the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, who are very much alive.

My name is Andrew. I'm currently listening to your Idolatry and iconography pair of episodes. Great stuff. And I couldn't Help but think about. There was a time I was at a relative's home, I'm Lebanese, in the Antiochian Archdiocese, and there was a figurine of BAAL on the mantelpiece that didn't sit right with me even before, even before I started listening to you guys, because this is, this is a, a demon. This is a pagan God. Why do we have him on the mantle? So I took him down and, you know, they said, well, you know, it's, it's our culture, it's our heritage. And it got me thinking, we're putting these figurines on the mantelpiece, or there's the little Phoenician statues of El. Or in the Greek archdiocese, I know some people whose mom's name is Athena. This, this pagan context that is so still part of our culture. And it seems like it's, it's no longer affiliated with worship, but it still doesn't sit too well with me. I really wanted to know what you guys thought about it. And while we're at it, same thing with ya', ain, the, the evil eye, the mati, these, these things that we're elevating to, you know, we're incorporating them into the faith. And I don't think the fathers really talk about that. So I'd like to know what you guys think, and I hope you have a wonderful day. Thank you so much, and I'll catch you later."}

Like a sculpture or a statue or Something like that that people put on their shelf as a kind of decoration, which I think is what Andrew's talking about. That to me, seems more questionable than, like. Although, I don't know, maybe. Maybe it's not. We could talk about this.

In the Middle east, that was the. Took the form of Arab nationalism. Because when the colonial powers drew all the lines, redrew all the lines, right. All these places included a lot of different religions, often that had a history of not liking each other. And so a new identity had to be formed. Right. We'll just take Iraq.

I have a question about how to interpret the numbers at the start of numbers, which is to say the census of Israel at the start of the Book of Numbers. You've mentioned before that one shouldn't take a modernist approach of numbers in scriptures. At the same time, one shouldn't just say they're merely symbolic or try to rationalize them away somehow. So I'm curious how the fathers and how the church have interpreted, applied, and what they've learned and taken from the census at the start of numbers, which is weirdly specific in many points. I mean, the numbers are quite exact. And I also don't know of all those numbers matching to something else in later church history, like the number of fathers at a certain ecumenical councils just matched 18,000 or something like that. Any insight you have on this would be appreciated. I myself work for the census of Canada. So this is pretty close to home stuff. Thank you very much. God give a blessing."}

So the answer is probably yes, but exactly what we don't know. Right. And of course, if you're reading the Greek or the Hebrew, the numbers don't match up, as is typical. They don't match up exactly. There is probably the reason we think there are, is that there are places and ancient Near Eastern texts that are similar. We've talked about this before on the show that where we've figured it out, we've sort of cracked mathematically what they're doing. And I have not seen at least."}

Not to just dismiss them, meaning that in the Asian world, they dealt with a lot of round numbers. You get like so many thousands or so many hundreds. Right. And when you have X number of thousands or X number of hundreds, not all of those Hundreds had exactly 100."}

Incorporate into your system of doctrine. Right. Like that's not how the text functions. I'm not an expert on the Ethiopian Orthodox Church by any means, but I know enough to know that's not how the text functions in the Ethiopian Orthodox Church where they feel the need to square it into a system of doctrine. And I'm mentioning that because he asked if there was something from them that would help us do that, incorporate it. And I'm like, They're not really about doing that. It's ambiguous as to what was being said in the first case. Whoever compiled, we could say at the very least, whoever compiled the Book of Enoch into the Book of Enoch, because of course it was separate documents before that were deliberately trying to. This is pre Christian, so it's not trying to set up something as a rival to Christianity, but was trying to set up Enoch as a rival to Moses as a central figure within Judaism. Very clear. I mean, it becomes very clear in like the animal apocalypse, for example. And so it's sort of a different mode of Judaism that has Enoch as a mediatorial figure. So it's very possible that the original intent was to present Enoch as the Son of Man figure in the Book of Daniel. That is very possible because of the overall tenor of the whole book and the way it was used in the Qumran community and other anakic Jewish communities. But 4q Melchizedek presents Melchizedek as the Messiah. Right. The value of it is not that it got everything about Jesus right before Jesus was born. There is no Second Temple Jewish literature that did that. Yeah, right. But we see the ideas and then what happens in the New Testament, even when they're quoting, like there are places in the New Testament that reference and quote the Book of Enoch, they're not saying, see this book prophesied everything. Exactly. Da da da da da. They're picking up those ideas and then sort of nuancing them and then showing how do how Christ fulfills them, how Christ is the reality behind them. Right. Not trying to subject the person of Jesus Christ to the Book of Enoch, but trying to subject the Book of Enoch to the person of Jesus Christ. There you go."}

So I'm calling to try to straighten out some tension I've got with the knowledge I get from your show and your work and etrustic knowledge and my embodied experience of studying scripture within the church and all that. So, so real specific Psalm 81, Father Stephen assures us, like beyond A doubt could only interpret Psalm 81, 82 in the Hebrew, 81 in the Greek as gods of the nations being judged. But then like you'll read in John Damascus, Gregory, a theologian, Augustine, a different interpretation, like it's humans, it's saints. So my reason tells me, through your reasoning, that it's got to be God to the nations. Because it reads that way, like the context makes total sense. But then I see a application from the saints that seems virtuous enough, helpful. You know, they used it to make a virtuous point that they were making. So how do I reconcile these sorts of knowledge? So, thanks."}

And that is defended by saying some version of, well, St. Paul has apostolic authority to reinterpret or reimagine or sort of redo the Old Testament because he's writing Scripture too. And so he can take it and make it mean something totally different. Right. I've often criticized this as St. Paul having the authority to read the Old Testament badly. There's a problem with that argument, but that's been carried over by the Church Fathers to the point that. And no one comes out and says this. I'm not saying anyone comes out and says this, but this is the presupposition underlying the way that a lot of orthodox people, I've found laypeople, right, not scholars, but lay people read the Church Fathers and that they assume that the Bible is just sort of this weird magical riddle box, like that's unintelligible and we can't possibly understand it. That kind of an overreaction against Sola Scriptura. So in Sola Scriptura, you have this related idea of the perspicuity of Scripture where the average person can pick it up and understand it completely, at least at its main thrust. And so people coming out of that background especially react against that and say, no, you can. No one can understand it. The only way to understand it is to see what the Church Fathers said about it, because the Church Fathers are the only ones who can understand it. And so even if the way you think the Church Father is interpreting the Bible makes no sense, right. That's considered a feature, not a bug, Right? Like, yeah, that makes no sense. But see, that's why I can't just read the Scriptures by myself, right? Because I never would have gotten that out of it. So the Church Father has this sort of magical power to understand what it really means, even though that's completely not apparent from reading it. Right? So again, I say that's a bad way of reading the Church Fathers, right? I think the Church Fathers, when the Church Father says a passage is connected to an idea, he's inviting us to come in and understand how he's interpreting the passage to get there, right? So obviously the saints, those who have experienced theosis, do not practice injustice and wickedness and do not die like men, right? That's sort of the whole point of theosis is that eternal life, right?"}

The one commentary that's immediately available as I just looked this stuff up about this. There's St. Augustine, and obviously we're out of step with him on some things. He's still a saint of the Orthodox Church. And if you look at what he says about this, I don't know which text this is from. Anyway, this is on the Catena website, which is useful for some things. He definitely. He definitely says, you know, you should not understand this, to be the gods of the nations, that this is not. These are not the idols, whatever this is. But he kind of skips over a lot of the bits in the middle about, you know, the things that. The bad things that they've done wrong. And he kind of says. He says, God stands in the congregation of men invisibly. He fills heaven and earth and so forth. So it's interesting that even though he is saying, like, you should not understand it in this way, but in this other way, the target that he's aiming at the whole time is the relationship of God to human beings. Right. And that it's not. It's not saints, and it's not. He doesn't even say that it's the judges of Israel. At one point he says, yeah, at the end it says, God therefore stood in the congregation of gods. That is he who said of himself, I am not sent, but to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. The cause too is mentioned, but in the midst to judge of the gods. So he's. He puts it in the point of view of this kind of soteriological thing and. And doesn't quote. Now, I don't know if this. There's some ellipses in here. So maybe he does reference it in some of these ellipses, who knows? But he doesn't sort of deal with the whole of the psalm all at once."}

When professional house restorer Kelly Mc Mason inherits a historic bungalow from an unknown benefactor, she plans to fix up the house and donate it to the community. But when she visits the place, she feels an unexpected emotional pull and decides to move in. As she works to restore the house, Kelly senses a ghostly presence guiding her to some startling discoveries about her own past. Her co workers, the McCarthys, and especially their enigmatically appealing friend Nathaniel encourage her to unlock her history and find the home and family she's never known.

This is Father James in British Columbia, Canada, and I have a question about monsters at Theophany. In the Gospel of Luke and the Gospel of Mark, John the Baptist calls people a brood of vipers. And this term is in Matthew as well. But I've noticed that the word he uses for vipers is echidna, which, other than once in Acts, doesn't show up anywhere else in the Bible, Old Testament or New Testament. But echidna is the name of a famous Greek monster who is the mother of, like, all the monsters, including Cerberus and Scylla and some even say the Harpies. And so I'm wondering if John is calling his audience monsters, if he's calling them the children, the offspring of echidna of this Greek monster, or if he's just saying you guys are like snakes. I'm very interested to hear your response. Thank you. Or if he's just saying you are like spiny anteaters, but which is. You know how that word is nothing."}

That's. We. We call it that because that's what we mean by it, you know, I mean, that's. That's the sense that I would have of it. I mean, I'm sure there's probably more that you could say, but, you know, like, the idea of rain falling from the sky, it does have that sense of coming down and. And being infused into the earth. Right. And. And of course, the earth being associated with the feminine is. Is a deeply mythic association, you know, whether it's the waters of the earth or of the. The. The ground itself. Right. There's always been that sense of feminine. And I. I suspect that that connection of the sort of the.

When the masculine feminine come together, that's going to signal the end of the world, right?

I'm an orthodox Christian in Portland, Oregon. In church, I am laity in the outside world. I'm a licensed professional counselor working in a very clinical context. And I have a question about exorcism as I'm working with people in their addiction and their trauma and working in their inner lives as they get to know the parts of their system. Sometimes we come upon parts that are, you know, very recognized by both me and the client as not from their system and having a lot of malevolent intent. Intent and just tormenting the person. And clinicians call these unattached burdens. I think they're demonstrating, they seem to have the features of dark spirits. And my question is, as laity in a non sacramental context, what do we do with this? I know what Protestants would do with this, but I never really felt comfortable with that. And I still don't feel overjoyed at the idea of interacting with these spirits. But I also know things are. I don't. I don't know what to think. But these people need help and their only access to the church is me. But again, I am not clergy. I'm not in a sacramental context. So what do I do?

I like to say that all the Christian life is exorcistic because it's all about driving out the works of the devil and bringing in the works of God in their place. So, yeah, I don't, you know, even though, you know Moses, you don't have. It's so funny to me to say that Moses, you don't have this authority. I'm like, wait, Moses did have that authority. Although you don't really see exorcisms exactly. Too much in the Old Testament, Moses does have that authority. Now, it doesn't mean that you can't do something to fight against the demonic presence in these people's lives. So that's what I think."}

And the way St. Paul understands it, and you can see this in the way he talks about certain things in Philippians, Saint Paul understands this, and Saint Luke is presenting it as Saint Paul by going and preaching the Gospel to all these nations, is calling these people away from idolatry to worship the true God.

I'm calling from Fort McMurray, Alberta. The question I have is regarding election. I am an Orthodox Christian, but my journey in faith began when I was a teenager growing up Baptist. I used to be a big fan. I still kind of am a bit of a fan of John Piper, but I, I'm just wondering, like, what. There was a knowledge of Christ. I was raised as a Christian, but when I became. When I came to faith, like, actually believed. Like there was a moment where I did not believe and then I did. It wasn't because I read a book. It wasn't because I. It wasn't because that, like, it was an event that happened. I felt like a little bit like C.S. lewis when he, he said he got on the bus and when he walked off the bus, he was a Christian. And there was no, There was nothing there. Like an intellectual assent. I didn't believe. And then I did. And from that point on, my life was changed. I'm wondering, in Orthodoxy, is there an explanation of that? Because it does seem like when it comes to free will and that I'm not struggling with it so much. But I am wondering, is there something in Orthodoxy that it kind of explains this? Maybe you can help me out with it. I would love to have a longer discussion, but it's only 9/90 seconds.

I mean, people do have experiences like this, right, where one. At one moment or one day, they. They don't believe, they don't acknowledge that Jesus is Christ. They don't want to follow him. And then another moment or another day, they do. Whereas a lot of. A lot of people, their whole life there, you know, like, their parents raised them to be faithful to Christ, and there was never a point where they didn't want to do that, that. Where they weren't set on that other people. It's kind of a gradual. A much more gradual thing where there's not like a before and after. So Rob is asking, like, is this is. I don't know if he means, like, is this something that everyone has to have or whatever? If that's the question, Rob, I don't think that everyone has to have that. Is it a thing that some people have? Oh, absolutely, clearly. But I don't think it's, like, required that there be this sudden before and after that there be a quote, unquote, conversion experience that people have. I think that that comes from, frankly, Protestant revivalism, that there's this emphasis on having had this conscious experience, you know, before and after. And I've. I mean, even before I was orthodox, I had a problem with that idea because I, you know, I was raised to be a Christian. I was raised. And so even though, like, I remember a point when I was 7 years old and I. I did the thing that all evangelical kids eventually do, which is, you know, you ask Jesus into your heart. Right. It's not as though, now, mind you, it's hard for me to remember this because this is now over 40 years later, but it's not as though I had any sense that before that, like, that, oh, I reject all that. And now suddenly I embrace all of that. No, I mean, I was raised to go to church. I. I always did that. I had no sense of. I don't. I shouldn't be doing this, you know. So. Yeah, my. My take is that it's a thing for some people, and it's great, but it's. It's not. Not a thing that's for everybody, you know, doesn't need to be. What do you think?"}

And isn't that more like that Calvinist version where something was changed in him without his sort of direct. Right. But so I mean, the reason people are Calvinists, right? The reason there are any Calvinists out there, right? Because obviously, no secret, I don't believe Calvinism is correct, right? But the reason why people believe it, and there's a variety of them, but I think the major one is that in some way something about it corresponds to their own experience of the world, right? And probably it's different parts of it for different people, right? So some people have a real experience of their own sin and so the idea of total depravity clicks with their own experience, right?

They have a profound experience of that. And, and so they, they accept Calvinism and there's probably other things, but what you're presenting could be one of them, right?

Someone has the experience of coming to Christ where they feel like it's not like I, you know, looked at all the available options and made this sort of informed choice. But, you know, I felt kind of compelled by something. But let me suggest that we have a similar phenomenological experience in other areas that we don't chalk up to God did this to me, right? We don't chalk this up to. This must have been sort of divine initiative. Because when, when we talk about having free will and a person being free, that doesn't mean they're conscious of all the factors that go into the decisions they make, right? So my experience of falling in love with my wife, right? There's some point in time where it went from, this is a person I know, this is a person I like to falling in love with her, right?

I've done the pros and cons, and I think I'm going to fall in love with this person. Yeah, right. A much more trivial version of this. When I go and order food off a menu, most of the time, right. I just see something on the menu and it's like, oh, that's what I want. Right. Like there's an inner movement. Right. Of that's the thing I need to order, or I go to a store and see something, I'm like, oh, I need to buy that. That's amazing. Right. That's not that I'm not choosing. I am choosing in all of those cases at some level. It's just I'm not fully aware of all of the dynamics that go into that choice, Right. Because I don't fully know myself. I don't fully know everything that's going on in my mind, right. Why I like one color shirt over another color shirt. There probably are reasons, Right. All kinds of associations from my past and nostalgia, things with my parents and growing up. Right. That caused me to be attracted to some things and not others. Right. But I'm not always aware of them all when I'm making the choice. Right. Certainly God is involved and is acting in all of our lives before, during, after. You know, as any given point we want to talk about in our spiritual lives. So whether we want to talk about baptism, whether we want to talk about the decision to join the church, the decision to be a Christian, the decision. Right. Any of those decisions, God is involved. God is acting before, during, after, and that is inseparable from us making the choice. We don't do any of these things independently of God."}

That's the best laugh I've had today. Here's my sense of this. I mean, it's this ancient sense that technology and magic are kind of one thing, right? That there's not sort of just blacksmiths, right. I mean, why is it that anytime, for instance, in, in Germanic poetry, Christian or. Well, we don't have any pagan. Actually. Hardly that I'm aware of. Actually. It's all, it's all written by Christians, although occasionally about pagans when really great weapons show up, or almost always there's some reference to them being made by Wayland, the sort of demi divine smith figure, right? And of course, like in Greek mythology, like if there's a really great weapon or piece of armor, like, oh, yeah, he's made that for my uncle or whatever, you know, there's always that. That sense. And it doesn't just mean that they're really good at the forge. There's this magical sense going on. These are divine figures, right? So a prayer against blacksmiths is not a prayer against people who happen to work iron. It's. Or whatever, you know, it's. It's really about this, right? That this, this. And we've talked about like technology and metallurgy, particularly on the show before. So you've been listening for a while, Patrick, then you know what we're talking about.

My question is about nationalism in the Orthodox Church. It seems like there's a lot of emphasis put on the different, like, ethnicities with regards to the various churches. It seems kind of strange to me as an American, like, what one's ethnicity would have to do with being a part of the one holy catholic and apostolic church. But it seems like for converts or people coming to the church, you kind of have to adopt either, you know, like Greek or Russian or Arab, some sort of other identity which you might not already have in order to. In order to do. To become a part of the church. So I'm just wondering, like, your thoughts on that, if you think it's a good thing, there's something to be gained from. From it. Yeah, thanks."}

So, okay, first, first I'll say, Rachel, that not every parish is like that. Like my parish is not. We have a little plurality of, like, Syrian Americans. But no one would go to our parish and say, oh, I need to become Syrian in order to be put part of this parish. No, because everyone in our parish speaks English. Our services are all in English. You would hardly know unless you started really looking around at people instead of maybe asking questions and checking their last names. You'd hardly know that we had this plurality of Syrian Americans in our parish. So not every parish is like that. And there's plenty of other parishes that are similarly situated. And you're right, you shouldn't have to become some other culture in order to be an Orthodox Christian. That said, I will say that different parishes, usually because of an immigrant experience here in America, they have these cultural connections in the parish, and in some cases, the parish is completely that. Right. And, you know, the services might be in another language. And even the language used at coffee hour is another language, you know, than. Than one that you speak. And these communities come out of a real experience of people immigrating and wanting to do church together. And it's completely understandable that it would arise that way. Right. So then the question is, okay, as an American who does not identify with that culture, what do I do with that? In some cases, the easiest thing to do might be to find another parish that you can connect with with. Now, in some places, that's not possible. Right. They might be too far away or whatever it might be. And of course, parishes can have other problems that might lead you not to want to be part of it, too. But let's say, you know, let's say you have the case of one community in your area or only one that's convenient to maybe, or something like that, and you can't move somewhere else else, Right. Then what do you do with that? Well, these are these people and this is who they are. Do I want to become part of their community? And what is the best way for me to become part of their community? You know, this would be true no matter what kind of church community you were joining. Right. Like there have been people, for instance, who. And this is maybe not as extreme of an example, but it's still an example because it can feel weird and foreign to people like who joined an evangelical church. And then they heard people saying things like, God laid this on my heart. Well, if you're not used to that language, you have no idea what that means. And it sounds like some weird foreign way of speaking. I know people who. That was their experience in encountering evangelicalism, you know, or they'll say. They'll hear people say things like, I felt the spirit move. Like what? You felt what? How did that feel? How do you know that that was the spirit? Like what? Right. So no matter what kind of community you join, there's going to be some kind of adaptation required. No matter what it is, even if it's just, let's say it's an orthodox church full of American converts who only speak English and everything is in English. If you're not used to orthodoxy, there's still going to be some adaptations that you're going to have to do. No matter what, it might still feel weird and foreign. I have known of people who, who have come into all English parishes in the United States and said, this is way too foreign. I don't fit in with this culture. And some people will say things like, I'm Western and this is Eastern, which I don't understand exactly what that means. But in any event, people do have that experience, and they will say things like that. So no matter what, there's going to be some adaptation required. Now, if you are part of the parish and you're asking the question of how do we welcome in visitors? That's a different. That's a different conversation, right? From that point of view, you have to ask yourself, okay, number one, are we the only Orthodox option in town? If the answer to that is yes, then you do have a duty to be welcoming to visitors. Now, if there are other options and you can talk with the people at those other parishes and they feel like, no, you know, we got this, fine, fine. I don't have a problem. I don't personally have a problem with parishes that exist as immigrant pockets. I don't have a problem with that, especially if there are other options for converts in the area. But if a parish is ready to open up and welcome other people, then they probably need to think about using the language that is the normal language throughout the whole country. You know, it's interesting to me, like, let's say you lived. Let's say you lived in Greece. Now, I do happen to know that there are parishes in Greece that do not use Greek. Like, I know of an Arabic parish, actually, near Athens. I don't know if there's any that use English. I don't know. But if you're living in Greece, would you ask yourself the question, do I have to become Greek to become part of the Orthodox Church? And. And the answer, obviously, in that case would be no. But you do have to deal with Greeks, right? They're the people there. So, yeah, to me, the question is, okay, I want to join this community. What do I need to do to join this community? And while some people might say things like, well, you need to become Russian or Serbian or Ukrainian or, you know, Syrian or Lebanese or whatever you know, it might be, that's not true. You can't become that if you're not that. But you can find ways of getting along with and living with those people. So that's. That's, to me, is what it. What it comes down to. So, Father Stephen, since this is the final boss of this episode, what do you have to say?"}

So the fact that we have. Well, there have been attempts, but the fact that the Orthodox Church has not tried to bootstrap an American Orthodoxy is a very good thing. Right. Because the thing that would be produced by that would be a nightmare. It would be American in all the worst ways. Right.

But this idea that just anybody should be able to be totally comfortable. Right, of course they shouldn't be comfortable. The church demands that every single one of us repent and change and be transformed. Right. The only way to craft a church such that anyone walking in would be comfortable would be for it to make zero demands of them whatsoever, accept them exactly the way they are and tell them they're perfectly fine."}

That's a good thing. That's one of the things that's protected Orthodox Christianity in this country from the way that American culture colonizes everything and corrupts it, frankly, with consumerism and these other traits. Right. These other negative traits. It's not just consumerism either, it's pornification. It's all kinds of things in American culture. I'm not a fan of American culture, if you haven't noticed, but those immigrant ties have protected the Orthodox Church from that."}

So my concern is less with how do we make the Orthodox Church more American. My concern is how do we stop it from becoming too American too fast and becoming some weird chimera. Right. Our goal has to be preserving what's been handed down to us. Preserving it intact, preserving it free from corruption and then presenting it to people because it will bring about their salvation. But it's going to challenge them. It's going to be difficult. It's difficult and takes time to understand how the Divine Liturgy is structured because it's structured very counterintuitively to the average non Orthodox person, let alone great compline, which is like the return of the King of Orthodox services. It ends like three times."}

These are all things that don't feel natural to people outside the Orthodox church. And that's a feature, not a bug. Church doesn't conform itself to the people it comes to. It conforms those people to the church. And Americans being conformed to the church is what will eventually produce an identifiable American Orthodoxy. And who knows, someday, 500 years from now, the American Orthodox Church may be sending missionaries somewhere to establish churches, say in China or Mongolia or something. And the Chinese people and the Mongolians will be like, well, how do I enter into this church without becoming American? Yeah, right. The way the Greeks who had to adapt to what was fundamentally a Jewish religion, now have people asking, well, how do I join this church without becoming Greek?"}
