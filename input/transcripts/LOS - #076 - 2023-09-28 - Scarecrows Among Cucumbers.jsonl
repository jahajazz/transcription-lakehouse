And he will be the light of the nations and the hope of those whose hearts are troubled. All who dwell on the earth will fall down and worship him. And they will praise and bless and celebrate with song the lord of spirits. First Enoch, chapter 48, verses 4 through 5. The modern world doesn't acknowledge, but is nevertheless haunted by spirits and angels, demons and saints. In our time, many yearn to break free of the prison of a flat secular materialism, to see and to know reality as it truly is. What is this spiritual reality like? How do we engage with it? Well, how do we permeate everyday life with spiritual presence? Orthodox Christian priests Father Andrew Stephen Damick and Fr. Stephen DeYoung host this live call in show focused on enchantment in creation. This the union of the seen and unseen as made by God and experienced by mankind throughout history.

My co Host, Father Stephen DeYoung is with me from Lafayette, Louisiana, thousands of miles away. And I'm Father Andrew Stephen Damick in Emmaus, Pennsylvania. And we are live. So if you're listening to us live and not via Memorex, you can call us at 855-237-2346 and you can talk to us and we're going to get to your calls in the second half of the show. And our own beloved Matuska Trudy will be taking your calls. If you've ever had a chat with one of our Calvinist friends about how he or she feels about other churches or theologies aside from Calvinism, you may have heard that person use the word idolatry. Not just Roman Catholics or us Orthodox either. Idolatry is a big category for Calvinists. It includes a lot. So what is idolatry? And do the Orthodox with their love and veneration for iconography, have an idolatry problem? I mean, if you venerate just a little too much. Did you do an idolatry?"}

And I hear even very intelligent people I know from that background make these kind of comments, like, you know, Saint Athanasius here. We'll see.

And that's sort of like saying, well, this church father condemned the pagan Roman emperor and didn't mention bishops, so he must be an anarchist. Right. Like Those don't follow. Right. You know, a bishop and a pagan emperor who declares himself to be a God. They're both authority figures. Okay?"}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #076 - 2023-09-28 - Scarecrows Among Cucumbers","start":375.26,"end":377.22,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Right, they're religious authority figures."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #076 - 2023-09-28 - Scarecrows Among Cucumbers","start":377.3,"end":410.65,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Yes, they're both religious authority because the emperor was the Pontifex Maximus of the Roman cult. Right. He was the high priest of the Roman culture. Right. So there are some superficial similarities. Right. But there are also much more major differences in how these roles are completely conceived of. And the same is true when you actually get into it about idolatry and iconography, because there's also pagan iconography as we'll talk about next time."}

And so what we're going to be doing is the next two episodes tonight we're doing idolatry. In a couple of weeks, we'll be doing iconography, and we're going to sort of explain what each of these things are historically in their religious use."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #076 - 2023-09-28 - Scarecrows Among Cucumbers","start":483.47,"end":483.87,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Right."}

And so, you know, as. As you mentioned, your rhetorical question, it's not like someone's going to walk into my parish and venerate the icon at the entrance too hard and accidentally do an idolatry, like, oh, no, wait, back off."}

So these are two fundamentally different things, even though they both involve imagery and both of all. And I will say here, because, you know, you mentioned it, this sort of weird colonial idea that, you know, the world is just full of these simpletons who don't have the kind of advanced religious sensibility I do. Right. And, you know, so, like, if they watch a movie with someone playing Jesus in it, they're just going to start worshiping the movie screen."}

Or if I've seen it, take the stat. Right. If you have a cross at the front of your church, they're just going to start worshiping the wooden cross. Like they're just too, too dumb to make the distinction in their mind between a wooden representation of the cross of Christ and God. Just too subtle for them. And this is, this is preposterous. And by the end of tonight, we're going to talk about just how idolatrous many of our smartest and savviest folks are without their knowledge."}

You know, if not help, I could just go full Pharisee if I need to. So, yeah, so we're going to start talking about idolatry where it arises. And of course, idolatry arises all over the world simultaneously within paganism. And this is another one of those things where someone recently online said in commenting on one of our old episodes that, where, where we had talked about how just sort of everyone in the world offers, offered sacrifices and offered incense and therefore that's sort of the natural way humanity worshiped. They, they acted like that was ridiculous."}

And we try to have reality based discussions here at Lord of Spirits rather than ideology based discussions. So. And this is just true. Right. And this is going back into the. Probably everyone has seen at some point, you know, going back to the Neolithic era, one of the earliest human crafted sculptures we have is that earth goddess."}

So as we've talked about some of this right here at the beginning, we're going to be reviewing, we're going to be pulling together some things we've said in different episodes in the past. So pagan worship, as we've talked about in the past, starts with certain essentially natural places, meaning before people start building temples, before people start constructing shrines, the naturally occurring features of the world become identified and become the locations for sacrificial worship, the offering of incense. Right. And another religious ritual. And as we've Talked about before. These are generally places where someone has had some kind of contact with a spirit."}

That as this begins to evolve, you start getting low fences, low rock walls, just circles of stones, ways of delimiting that particular space, marking out that particular space. This is the space where the spirit that they hold to be divine was encountered."}

And so this is the place where we return to interact with, participate in that spiritual reality. And before you start getting what we would call idols proper, you start out with, again, sort of unworked natural features. So you get a tree, a large tree that's at the center of one of these spaces. You get a pole. You get some kind of standing stone. Many of these were deliberately. The first shaping that happens to them is not carving them into human or animal forms, but generally shaping them into phalluses if they didn't already look like them."}

Of course, we talked about previously when we were talking about the story of the Tower of Babel, that part of the story of the Tower of Babel is them trying to Draw God down. Right.

There's even fun traditions, I mean, not mentioned in the Bible, but, like, from Second Temple Jewish stuff, that talk about Nimrod, you know, building the tower. And number one, this is my favorite part, if we build it high enough, then when God floods the place again, we'll escape this time. And then also, like, the idea of, you know, and also while we're up there, we can make war on heaven and, you know, bring him down. So it's just another way of that same. Using the same kind of imagery of trying to defeat God, you know?"}

Right. Idolatry coming into being and a depiction of it. And so, of course, it's after that, as God, true God, sort of withdraws from humanity to protect humanity from his own holiness, so he won't destroy the world again as he did with the flood, that angelic beings are assigned to the nations of the world. And it's from there that, as we've talked about before, that pagan worship and idolatry evolves, as we see in the archaeological and anthropological record. So how does."}

You have to. You have to have a place to meet with him. And so the idol serve to localize, to bring the deity to that place. And this becomes so true that there are particular hypostasis. And if me using that word freaks you out, listen to some old episodes. I'm not going to go through it again. Now, of past pagan gods get named after these places."}

It was a craft. It was a. They actually did engage in priestcraft. It was based on having certain knowledge. And that knowledge was practical knowledge, not esoteric knowledge about the origin or nature of the universe or the names of the gods or something, but a very practical kind of knowledge. So we mentioned before, I know that in Exodus, you know, the quote unquote magicians, traditionally Jannes and Jambres who confront Moses, Pharaoh's quote unquote magicians are actually what are called by historians now lector priests. Not related to Hannibal Lecter, but lector is in reader. Right. And that's because the cast of priests at that time in Egypt, their primary job was being able to read. Hieratic has a lot of symbols. It's not an alphabetic language. And so they were able to read the already ancient documents, the ancient ritual texts, to find out the procedures needed, the procedures for burial, the spells needed to enter into the afterlife. When something would befall Egypt, Pharaoh would call them in and say, hey, there was a comet. Hey, there's a famine. Hey what, there's plagues from this Moses guy. What do we need to do to fix this?"}

What do we need to do to make this situation right? And it was then the job of those Egyptian priests to go consult those ancient texts and say, okay, here's what we need to do. And tell them you can think about other. Right, the haruspex, his whole job. And even though that's the Latin term they used in Rome, this is a priestly class all through the ancient near east, being able to read the entrails of sacrifices, it was their job to learn how to do that. These are the signs, right? When we cut open the. When we're butchering the sacrifice, one of the primary ways they saw whether the sacrifice was being Accepted or not, was to look for certain signs on different organs. Oh, there's a black spot here. Or in some weird cases, this organ is missing or right. These were all different omens and signs. And those priests needed to know how to identify those and then what needed to be done in response? Rome famously had the Sibylline books which were hidden under one of the hills and under Temple of Jupiter, cast of priests who was allowed to read from these books. And so something went wrong in Rome. They consulted the books which supposedly recorded the whole history and future of the world and said, okay, this is what we need to do to take care of that comet. This is what we need to do to take care of this ill omen, this failure in war. Here's what we need to do. And that would include with those books, like we need to bury a couple of slaves alive in the marketplace. Okay, that's what we're doing. But it was this technique and having access based on practical knowledge, being able to read, being able to consult, being able to interpret."}

They taught him how to carve a statue to look like a person or to look like a dog person. Like what? That's not what was being taught. It's the whole technique, right, that we've been talking about in outlining here, of trying to control and manipulate the divine realm that it's saying was taught by demons. Right? So again, idolatry is not just making a piece of imagery. Idolatry is everything else we've been talking about, right? The ritual elements, the control, the manipulation, right? That's what idolatry is about. And so when you read in the Old Testament, the Hebrew Bible, other extra biblical Jewish anti idolatry texts, they talk about those who worship them become like them."}

Oh, but all of this archaeological evidence, all this other stuff shows that they weren't. That they were actually polytheistic and worshiping all these pagan gods. Now some of these people who say this have PhDs in Old Testament or Hebrew Bible and. Or Hebrew Bible. And this confuses me because it implies to me that they've never read it. Because as we're about to go through. You can't swing a dead cat without hitting idolatry in the Old Testament. In fact, I will go so far as to say you're hard pressed to find any period in Israel's history where according to the Bible, they were even monolatrous, let alone monotheistic."}

And then folks who watch these documentaries who maybe haven't read the Old Testament or haven't read much of it, buy it, just believe what they're saying. But let's. We're going to go through and. And Israel's idolatry can kind of be divided into two categories. That's how we're going to approach it here. First category is places where. And we're going to get. We're only giving examples. Right. We'd be here all night, like trying to go through every place the Bible talks about Israel being idolatrous."}

So the first category is where they're using idolatry directed toward Yahweh, the God of Israel. And then the second category is when the scriptures talk about Israel engaging in idolatrous worship of other gods alongside Yahweh, the God of Israel. So those are sort of the two broad categories. Both of these are bad and these are related to the first two commandments. So the second commandment is about not making graven images and bowing down to them and serving them. This is talking about idolatry, period. So this is saying, don't try to worship Yahweh, your God via idolatry. Why? Because what are you doing? You're trying to do what they did at the Tower of Babel. You're trying to limit the God who created the universe. You're trying to limit the God of Israel, trying to draw him down, limit it, get control of him and get him to do what you want. So second commandment says you don't do that. First commandment is you'll have no other gods in my presence. So that's our other category, right? You're not to worship these other gods alongside, right?"}

And that was one verse I was thinking about where John gets this, you know, vision, things like that, from the angel, and he bows down to worship him. Sounds like he's doing a prostration or something like that that uses the word worship at least twice in that. In that. That passage. And then the angel tells him not to worship him because he's just a servant of God, like St. John is. And so I'm thinking, you know, if making a prostration to something is worship, is that what we're doing when we prostrate for, like, the holy cross and things like that? Or is that just veneration? If that makes sense, yes."}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #076 - 2023-09-28 - Scarecrows Among Cucumbers","start":4489.79,"end":4551.14,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Well, it's a bit. It works, right? I mean, if I recall. I think we've talked about this before. But if I recall correctly, the point that the angel is making there is to say to St. John, I'm not the angel of the Lord, so you should not be treating me as though I'm God himself. It's not that bowing or prostrating is in and of itself bad, because we see that happening between righteous people, for instance, that bow down to the ground to each other, and no one. And the other one doesn't say, whoa, whoa, whoa, stop it, Idolater. You know, so, I mean, you know, as we said, right. Idolatry involves setting up an image, feeding, and clothing it. Understanding is controlling elemental forces and spirits, Right? That's a whole big ball of action. And understanding that is not simply bowing or prostrating. I don't know. Father, is there anything you wanted to add or correct or subtract?"}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #076 - 2023-09-28 - Scarecrows Among Cucumbers","start":4551.46,"end":4565.38,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Well, I think the key thing that's going on there in context in Revelation is that that angel is differentiating himself from the figure of the glorified Christ who had been talking to St. John before that."}

We're saying worship is a veneration is B. Right. But that doesn't mean that anytime you see a hymn from 15 centuries ago that uses the word worship."}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #076 - 2023-09-28 - Scarecrows Among Cucumbers","start":4652.88,"end":4755.6,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Yeah, like even in English, the word worship. The word worship in English for most of its history has meant veneration. You know, it hasn't meant sacrificing to a God. Now, I mean, now we do use it in that way, but mostly because it's, you know, connected to the word worth. So it's just showing the worthiness of the other. So if you said, you know, good day, sir, which is language of respect. Right. And honor, that is literally worshiping that other person according to that older sense of the word worship. And it's why, like, British judges are called your worship. No one thinks that they're being sacrificed to his gods. It's just a form of respect. So. So, yeah, I mean, as Father said, the words are not always used in these tight, technical ways. So the key. This is the important thing. What is the action being done and what is the context of that action? And is it part of a larger set of actions? Right, okay. Like you can. You can put food in front of somebody. Let's say you wait table at a restaurant, you can put food in front of someone and say, there you go, sir. So you've not only put food in front of a being, which is a spiritual being, because it's human, but, you know, also said words of respect, does that make you an idolater? You know, obviously not. Even though putting food in front of an image of a spiritual being and saying words of respect is part of idolatry, you know, there's a lot more going on in idolatry. Does that make sense?"}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #076 - 2023-09-28 - Scarecrows Among Cucumbers","start":4756.88,"end":4774.04,"speaker":"Daniel","text":"Yeah. So just to clarify, that prostration or whatever was happening, there was St. John bowing down to the angel. That's not necessarily worship. I mean, he didn't offer a sacrifice or anything to the angel. He just basically venerated from what it seems like. Is that correct?"}

So Latin speaking people did not think that every time you bent your knee and bowed to someone, you were worshiping them in some idolatrous sense. Right.

And I know we've talked about it at least a little on the show before that. Right. If. If we had a photo of it or if we had the thing, which of course we don't because it got melted down, it would probably look like an APIs bull from Egypt, seeing as folks had just come from Egypt and an odd preponderance of Levites have Egyptian names, so they were probably connected to Egyptian religion in some way before the exodus. So it was likely would have looked like an APIs bull. But it wasn't purely an Egyptian phenomenon because, of course, the APIs bull and everything else, this draws on the whole bull of heaven, behemoth, behemoth traditions that we've talked about on the show several times before. So this is kind of an assimilation of Egyptian and Canaanite idolatry and even earlier forms of idolatry. But after Aaron makes the calf, what does he say?

And so that's a good segue. Moving to the northern kingdom, when Israel is split to the northern kingdom of Israel in The southern kingdom of Judah. First king of the northern kingdom is Jeroboam, the son of Nebat. And God sends a prophet to Jeroboam, son of Nebat. He says, if you keep all of my commandments and are righteous before me as David was, then I will also give you a dynasty that will have no end."}

David kept all the commandments, but we did that on another show, talking about repentance. And of course, Jeroboam does not do likewise. And so his dynasty lasts for two generations, counting him himself. His son becomes king, and then assassination, it's over. But Jeroboam, when he becomes king of the northern tribes, has this issue of, you know, David's son or David's grandson. Rehoboam is the king down there in Judah, and they have the temple in Jerusalem, and that's where all the worship is supposed to be going on. And a lot of the feasts of the Torah, right, say the Day of atonement, obviously centered around the temple sanctuary, right? So he doesn't want his people having to travel to this other kingdom to worship, etc. Etc. So he famously constructs the golden calves because the first one went so well. But the golden calves at Bethel and Dan, Dan being at the extreme north, Bethel at the south of the northern kingdom of Israel. And that way, no matter where you live in his kingdom, there is one of his golden calf shrines that is closer to you than the temple in Jerusalem is, so you can go there instead. And so we can see there that setting up these calves there has this deliberate goal of localization. Yeah, yep, Right. He is very much trying to localize the God of Israel."}

He has his own feasts like the one we were just talking about with Jephthah. It's a different cycle of feasts. This is a whole different set of ritual observances. Right. That are borrowed, that are not. Sort of like the Samaritans did, where the Samaritans later took the Torah and tweaked things. Right. So we could do them at Mount Gerizim. And so we could. Right.

Right. The BAAL of Peor, which is a localization of BAAL Baalpaor, is a classic example also of a high place. So you'll see throughout the Old Testament, the Hebrew Bible references to high places. It'll talk about good kings tearing down the high places and bad kings building back up the high places. Right. And these high places are a type of pagan shrine that is less than a fully constructed temple, but a little more than the grove. It's that in between category where you have an area that's delineated by a fence or a wall surrounding various natural features. And it's a place, it's a sort of a zone there then on a hill, hence high place, where ritual worship of. Of various gods takes place. And so in this example, Baalpaor being one of them, there is this mixture which hopefully, if not before, people will kind of be ready for now, given what we've already talked about in this half of these foreign pagan women drawing the men of Israel astray and references to the pagan worship of baal, Right. And that's because these are the same things. This is the same kind of orgiastic worship from the Golden Calf. It's just now being done with these quote unquote priestesses or temple prostitutes as they're sometimes called, who are there to facilitate that kind of worship. Because baal storm God, this is a fertility Right. Shrine. And so the. This orgasic worship begins to take place. And this escalates in the story to the point where a man takes one of these women into the camp to continue these activities, walks past Moses and Aaron and the others. So not only are they going out of the Israelite camp, which is to be kept holy. Right. Going out of it and performing these acts of idolatry and sexual immorality, but now this escalates with this man now bringing that into the camp, into the presence of God. And that's why Phineas has to go and mega shish kebab. And."}

Get excited, folks. I'm about to talk about Samson, but only briefly as we keep going in Judges, Right? Not going to talk extensively about Samson, but notice that when the angel comes to announce the birth of Samson, we're told that his family lives near Beth Shemesh, Beit Shemesh, which literally means the temple of Shemesh, the sun God. So apparently Dan is cool with there being a temple to the pagan sun God Shemesh. There doesn't have a problem with it. And if you say, well, that probably didn't include Samson's family, I would point out that they named him after Shemesh. That's where the name Samson comes from. So again, you see this kind of pagan syncretism going on. It's not that they don't acknowledge and worship Yahweh, it's just they've got these other God, pagan gods too. And then in the last part, with the Israelite civil war and everything at the end of Judges that we don't read as much because it gets really gory and messed up. We read about a Levite who gets hired to come and serve an idol in Dan. So this is the kind of thing that's happening not hidden by the Bible. The Bible is how we know about it. It tells us about it. Now, lest you think from what we said about Jeroboam son of Nebat, and the northern kingdom, that the southern kingdom was doing it. Right. We know that from the story of Solomon.

So keep this in mind, the first temple, from the time Solomon built it to the time of its destruction by the Babylonians, minus this little window where. Where King Josiah tried to clean things up. Right. Was full of idolatrous shrines. According to the Bible, there was no sort of pure golden age period here with the first Temple."}

It wasn't for doing things right and worshiping in purity. Right. That's not how you end up in exile. And further, we also know, because Josiah briefly put an end to this as well, that Molech worship was going on mostly the Valley of Hinnom. People want to argue about that now, but, hey, if you believe the Bible's true, I'm sure it was going on other places in the northern and southern kingdoms too. But Molech worship was what we're talking about. And this was very popular in certain Phoenician sectors was the sacrifice of your firstborn infant. And this was as a burnt offering.

But so now, of course, that's right. The Southern kingdom, the Northern Kingdom, in addition to the sort of paganized religion that Jeroboam of Son of Nebat starts, as I mentioned, when you get to the Omride dynasty, started by Omri, his son Ahab. Omri marries his son Ahab to Jezebel the bell in her name is baal. If you didn't know who was a daughter of the king of Sidon, one of the primary Phoenician cities. And so she came and brought Baal worship in alongside of it and seems to have maybe even wanted to displace Jeroboam's religion with more of her family religion. And Ahab seems to have been especially weak. But this is why it's this, this religious imposition, we might say, from a modern perspective and the kind of idolatrous worship that we've been discussing that she brings into the Northern kingdom that causes the entire Omride dynasty to get wiped out over the course of the end of 1 Kings, beginning of 2 Kings, because they're the ones sort of deliberately responsible for it. From the Bible, Ahab seems like a more prominent figure than Omri. So some folks may be wondering why I keep calling it the Omrid Dynasty. From the perspective of ancient history and the ancient near east and all the inscriptions we have from other countries, Omri is the most important king of Israel period, northern kingdom, southern kingdom combined. They refer to the northern kingdom of Israel as the house of Omri. For a long time until its destruction. We have inscriptions of this. He gets six verses in the Bible that basically just say he was wicked, he bought the hill where they built Samaria, he died. And as for the other stuff, he did read the official annals of the king, who cares? And then they move on to get to the story of Elijah, not even the story of Ahab his son, but the story of Elijah. And so just a note here, because this is something obviously that comes up in scholarship, this whole idea. You will see a lot of things in Old Testament scholarship referring to Israelite priests. Israelite priests do all kinds of things pre exilic, post exilic. There's the P source or so P sources and the whole JEDP thing with the Torah, with other, the priestly source and other books of the Old Testament. Much is made of the Israelite priests and how they were trying to enforce, you know, only the worship of the one God, only from the temple in Jerusalem all along. And they were the ones really enforcing this. When you look at the actual picture, Israelite priests becomes really problematic because if you follow what we just went through and you follow what the Old Testament scriptures, the Hebrew Bible says, most of the priests, most of the Levites who are serving priestly functions in Israel, again, especially once it's divided. But even with Solomon, even during the period of the Judges, are pagans, the vast majority of them."}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #076 - 2023-09-28 - Scarecrows Among Cucumbers","start":7575.77,"end":7737.19,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Idolatry is planet forbidden. And the perspective from which, beyond what we've already talked about, idolatry is critiqued within a Christian framework. So we have to start with sort of prohibitions of literal idolatry. And what I mean by that is obviously Christianity proper, we're talking about the first century A.D. the apostles. There is very literal pagan idolatry going on all around them. And especially when the apostles go out into the Greek and Roman world and beyond it, they are Going to communities that are steeped in idolatry. That's whole, the whole self identification of those communities, those cities, those people groups, is based around idolatrous worship and festivals and these things. So within the pages of the New Testament and in the early centuries, pre Constantine, in the Roman Empire, we find very literal prohibitions of the idolatry we described in the first half and really the second half. Right. So in fact, not only was. Was paganism still very much around in the Roman Empire in the first century, but it was sort of ascendant and had been deliberately revitalized in the wake of philosophical schools in the Greek and in the Roman world. A lot of what anthropologists now would label traditional folk religion, which seems to be the origin of the word paganism, for example, had kind of faded off. There were still certain civic festivals, there were still offerings made to the gods, but sort of active participation in these things, the number of sacrifices that were being made, especially government participation right from the Senate. Right. And these kind of things, sacrifices were still being done in this kind of thing, but they were done in this very rudimentary way. Right. Sort of. This is what we do, this is what we have to do. There was even a certain amount. There are certain quotes you could find from Roman generals and senators and this kind of thing and thinkers that sound pretty jaded as far as the gods go."}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #076 - 2023-09-28 - Scarecrows Among Cucumbers","start":7740.07,"end":8105.58,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"There of course were no atheists, but. Right. These were looked at in a, in a certain way. You find Greeks joking about referring to the, the sacrifices being offered as the burning of the bones, because as they pointed out, like all the useful parts of the animal people were keeping for themselves. And then they're just burning the parts they didn't want, giving those to the gods. You find this attitude prevailing when Augustus becomes Augustus, when Octavian becomes Augustus and becomes Caesar, becomes the emperor, he embarks on a massive project to solidify the empire. You get the Aeneid, the new history of the Roman people. You get Ovid in his metamorphoses, collecting a lot of the folk traditions, religious traditions of the people throughout the empire. And you get Augustus himself really embracing his role as Pontifex Maximus. We have at least one very significant intact statue of Augustus in which he is wearing the head covering of a Roman priest to convey this role as Pontifex Maximus. He begins to publicly offer sacrifices and lead these festivals again. And this is tied to him wanting to re. Embrace the Roman tradition. So there's very much an emphasis on this coming top down on religious observance. Pagan religious observance from the empire during, for example, St. Paul's missionary journeys. And that's part of what exacerbates the tensions that he faces in coming to some of these cities and is what is going to later in future bouts of this traditionalism, what's going to bring about a lot of the persecution of Christians. The persecution of Christians is sporadic through the later history of the Roman Empire until St. Constantine. But usually when it erupts, it's during a push to re. Embrace traditional religion. Those pushes are often motivated by some calamity or other or problem or other within the empire that they are returning to their gods to try to solve. And of course, the Christians weren't going to join in with that. And so it became a problem to be eradicated. But so when you read especially St. Paul's letters to the church at Corinth, right. Corinth is an ancient Greek city. Now, technically, the one St. Paul writes to, isn't that ancient because the Romans destroyed it and rebuilt it. But it has this legacy come back. Corinth, yes. There's a reason they did that. They did that because Corinth had been the head of Corinthian League. Corinth had been the city that gathered up the Greek city states when they were for common defense and this kind of thing. So when the Romans came to take Greece and wanted to make a statement, they made that statement by leveling Corinth, then rebuilding it to say, don't get any ideas. But it has this legacy and is very much a part of this idolatrous revitalization. And so a lot of what St. Paul talks about, there's a reason St. Paul keeps vacillating in those epistles between don't participate in idolatry and don't participate in sexual immorality. Right. Sometimes within a few verses, right? Because as we've talked about in the first two hours, these are deeply linked. And there are these festivals in Corinth where mysteries are celebrated. And we get this kind of orgiastic worship, this breaking of social bounds and boundaries. This is why in the epistles to Corinth, St. Paul keeps talking about everything being done decently in good order within Christian worship, about maintaining traditional hierarchies within Christian worship, because this is over against a paganism that saw the transgressive breaking of these things as the means to spiritual ecstasy. And he's trying to pull these former pagans, now Corinthian Christians, into being more former pagans. Right? To separating that and delineating what Christian worship is about from what pagan worship was about. And you see the same thing with St. John. There's this emphasis on idolatry in especially first John, second and third are pretty short, but gets touched on a little there. But first John, you see this emphasis on idolatry because he's writing to Christian communities in and around Ephesus, hub of idolatry place where there is the temple of Artemis, one of the seven wonders of the ancient world, the main source of the local economy. And so he also. Right. There has to be this delineation. Right. Because what saints Paul and John and the apostles in general are doing is they're not only. It's not only a question of, no, you need Christian worship to be like our Jewish worship, which is pure, not like that pagan worship, which is evil. But there's an introspective nature of it in terms of how St. Paul thinks about the history of Israel."}

Neither of those are acceptable options. Neither the gods alongside the God of Israel nor the worship the true God in this pagan, idolatrous way. Neither of those are acceptable. Neither of those are acceptable. And a bunch of former pagans coming in to join Jewish Christians has the potentiality to go in one of those two directions. And especially in a place like Corinth, where it seems that it was mainly former pagans and fewer Jewish Christians."}

So in the Roman Empire at least, paganism really ends in the fourth century. And it doesn't end because Constantine and his successors go and murder all the pagans. That silly nonsense. It didn't happen. St. John, Chrysostom's mentor, his teacher of rhetoric, was one of the last generation of pagans, lived a healthy life, remained a pagan, but the pagans of that era were very much no longer practicing the kind of things we've just been talking about already. Christianity had had an effect, to use very modern terms, both paganism and various philosophical schools that were themselves, as we talked about, embedded in paganism still had to compete with Christianity in the marketplace of ideas."}

And so as they saw the world shifting around them toward Christianity, they had to take the Christian, many of them inherited Jewish critiques of idolatry, of their mode of worship.

And that mode of thinking and talking about idolatry and warning against idolatry is just as pertinent as it ever was. And this isn't just sort of, okay, well, all the pagans went away, so the 5th century church fathers decided to come up with another allegorical thing and call it idolatry. So that those commandments still had relevance. Right. Because of course, they saw, as we'll talk about more next time, that they had no relevance to iconography. But this already starts within the Scriptures, within the New Testament. Idolatry is used in this way specifically by St. Paul. So St. Paul, they're Colossians and Ephesians. A lot of the contents parallel each other. I will not now go into all the weird theories as to why journal articles have to be written, dissertations have to be published."}

And it might be easy to say, oh, well, he's just analogizing. Right. Or this is an allegorical thing, that it's like idolatry. But pause for a second, because notice in both of these places where he identifies it as idolatry, he connects it. He ties it to sexual immorality in the way that literal idolatry is tied to sexual immorality throughout the Scriptures, as we've seen. So what St. Paul sees here about covetousness and idolatry goes beyond an analogy. Right. He's seeing something in terms of how it works, how covetousness works, and how idolatry worked or works. And so think about how we were saying in the first half, idolatry works, that idolatry gives you this handle or this grip on these spiritual forces at work in the world that are beyond your control. That's the idea, at least."}

I grew up kind of non denominational, but I'm trying to sort through everything by listening to you guys and the whole sphere. And I was. I kind of glanced over at my computer. I'm a software. Software technology type person for a profession. I glance over at my computer while listening to him talk about idolatry and things like that. And also just through listening to the definition that you guys are giving, it started to concern me a little bit. Just, I mean, because we. There's a series of obviously bits and switches that turn on and off. It's a thing that we create kind of as Pajal will say, like you sacrifice your time and attention as a software developer or even like an electrical engineer to kind of breathe life into the machine, to make it do what you want. And I don't think of it that way. I just think of it as a tool. But I'm hoping that the Father Stevens can alleviate some of my concerns that we're just building one big massive AI idol."}

This is my life. So what I would say is, I mean, like, there's not nothing to that. Right. You know, we're talking about idolatry as techni. This attempt by human beings to manipulate the world. Right. And as. So if you've listened ever since some. Our earlier episodes, you know that we've said that technology in and of itself is not evil. Right. It's. It's the. In many cases getting it too early. But the whole point being using it in a bad way, that is the problem. So, I mean, here we are. Father Stephen is in Louisiana. I'm in Pennsylvania. You're in the holy land of Virginia, where I happen to have been born. And the only reason we're able to talk to each other live is because of computer technology. So obviously we're not saying that that is an evil thing in and of itself. But I do think that if people are using it to control and destroy one another and to enrich themselves at the expense of other people especially, and especially beyond what they actually need, then, then yes, it is, in a way, you know, it does become this handle of mammon, right. That it becomes this engine of, of human destruction. I mean, I, I haven't, I haven't listened to any of, of Jordan Peterson's Exodus stuff, so I have no idea what he said about any of that."}

I'll just put it that way. But that's just, that's not a thought out theological position. That's just the way that I, the way that I am experiencing how the world is actually functioning.

Right. And whether, I don't know where exactly to nail down what is the idol. Like, I don't think the physical computer is the idol or the Internet is the idol. It may be that the idol in that kind of situation is sort of the curated version of oneself that one creates online. And I don't just mean making an avatar in meta or something. I mean, everyone who uses social media is a phony. That's the carefully curated version of yourself that you put out there to the world that, that might be ultimately the idol. Because that's what you're using to try to kind of take control of your own destiny and your own, your own fate. Because maybe you feel like you can't control those things about yourself in reality. So you enter into a kind of realm of unreality where you can control those things. What you look like, what you sound like, how you come off to other people. So yeah, in terms of the AI level, I mean, I've seen the Apple on Star Trek, right? Like, I mean, you can envision, I've played paranoia. You can envision a world where there is an AI that becomes sort of an idol, right. Where people sort of serve it. Mrs. Davis, recently. But I don't think we're there yet in reality. I think we're Very. We're much farther from that in reality than people realize. I think, like, ChatGPT, for all of its amazingness, is really just Google and crossed with an Eliza program.

Justice, right. When most people talk about justice today, they're not talking about, like, the divine energy of justice, right? God's activity in bringing about justice. They're not tying that to the God who created the universe, who is infinite. They have a concept of justice. Here is what justice is. Justice is fairness. Justice is the redress of historical inequity. Justice is the punishment of the guilty. But that concept, right, however it's defined, that definition is a delimitation. It is a mental shaping and a mental reduction of the justice of God into this image, right? This delimited image. And then once it's been reduced to that concept, that concept can now be manipulated. It's now an idea. We've talked about ideas, how they can be instrumentalized. I can use that concept of justice to make an argument to you, to make a presentation to you and use it to manipulate you and get you to do what I want, right. By appealing to these concepts once I've defined them and delimited them, and they allow me to get a handle on these forces that are otherwise beyond my control, to bring about agreement, to control other people who aren't necessarily going to do what I want and who might threaten me and my interests in various ways.

Just a side note, I know there are orthodox folks out there on the Internet who say things pro Christian nationalism and some of you even evoke like Saint Constantine to talk about Christian nationalism as if the Roman Empire was a nation state, like huge category mistake. The nation state is a different concept.

{"episode_id":"LOS - #076 - 2023-09-28 - Scarecrows Among Cucumbers","start":10591.99,"end":11080.49,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Yeah. Yep. So flee from idols, as the apostle says. You know, I've been. I've been. I've been rolling around in my mind the question of what I might say at the end here. But. And the thing that finally came to me is I think that some people actually. I don't think this. I know that some people actually use the church itself as a kind of idol. And I know that some people would recoil from that idea. Right. I've even heard people say or seen them say on the interwebs things like, well, can Christ be separated from his church? In other words, you know, it's not possible to treat the church as an idol because Christ is the church. You know, the church is Christ. Right. And sometimes they'll say, that in. In the context of apologetics against other Christian groups, you know, essentially saying it's impossible to follow Christ unless you are orthodox effectively. And, you know, that question aside, which is a whole big interesting discussion, but this issue of treating the Church as an idol. So if Christ and the Church are simply the exact same thing and completely coterminous in every possible way, then why do we bother having two words? Why, you know, why do we talk about Christ and the body of Christ? It's not because they're separable. But even that aside, let's. I'll just grant that, right, that you. That there's no, you know, even if one wants to make a total identification between Christ and the Church, which I don't think is correct, it is still possible to treat the church as an idol. Because what happens is people have a concept of the church that they are worshiping, a concept of the Church that they are using, as you said, Father, as a kind of handle on the world. Right. What does that look like? Well, it looks like a lot of different things. One way that it can look is when people have an idea of a particular time and or place in church history and make that the end all, be all of what it means to be Christian. You know, you can usually note that they're doing this because they'll have the word holy and then the name of some time, place, empire, kingdom or whatever after that word, you know, and in holy, blah, blah, blah. It was this way, and we have to get back to that. You know, so there's this kind of toxic nostalgia that sometimes exists. Sometimes people will idolize elements of church life. Probably the most common is monasticism. And the weird part about it is this is often being done by non monastics, you know, and the very otherness of it, I think, is part of what enables people to turn it into an idol. And so they'll say, well, these monastic fathers say this, and that's used as a manipulation over and against, in many cases, the rest of the tradition of the Church, you know, the rest has to submit to that. People can idolize the liturgical life of the church. They can worship, worship, you know, and you can note that that's. That that's happening because then the way that it gets used, like I have witnessed and been told of stories of clergy serving services who are acting in abusive ways because the people around them are not doing exactly the thing that they're supposed to do. And I don't just mean like offering proper correction and whatever, but like yelling and even I've heard of people throwing things, right? That kind of thing. The authority within the church can be treated in an idolatrous manner. It is the case that right now, in some parts of the world, if you are an orthodox clergyman and you preach something that you know is true but is not popular with the government and church leadership of your time and place, that you can be penalized and even arrested, fined. I mean, this is turning church authority into an idol, right? I mean, I could go on and on, I could go on and on and on. But how do you know you've turned some element of the church or your concept of the church into an idol? It's when it takes people away from Christ himself. It's when it takes people away from the life of following the commandments of Christ, right? It's when it's used as a weapon against other people, manipulation against other people and for one's personal self aggrandizement, which could be, you know, about money and power and all that, that stuff. But it could also be about, you know, owning your opponents, right? People can turn theology into an idol. It just becomes a bunch of words that ultimately don't point towards some life in Christ, but are about defeating other people and winning arguments and so forth. There is a lot of this within the Orthodox Church of our time on display. It is happening and it is, it is very sad. I'm not saying it's predominant necessarily. I don't know enough about what everybody is doing to be able to say that, but it is, it is definitely out there. And, and there are people who are being driven away from the church, whether because they never join it or because they've just had enough. Because people are treating the church as an idol and not as the body of Christ. Right? So how do we guard against that? How do we flee from that idol? Well, number one, we should remember that our concepts of the church are not the church. The Church is the living body of Christ. It is we who are, who are in it. It's not an ideology, it's an actual community. And it is in the world to do the works of Christ in the world. That's how we are his body. We are his powers and his nexus of powers. And we are potential in the world. That is who the body of Christ is. And so where you see people being made, saints, made to live the way that Christ lived and to be the way that Christ is, then it's being done, right? But when you see it used to destroy other people in whatever way, then it's Become idolatry, then it's about control, right? So flee from idols. Love Christ above all. And you know, remember that following the commandments is the foundation for all of the rest of orthodox tradition. And if you're not living in such a way that you're following the commandments, then according to the scriptures, you do not love God. And if you don't love God, then you're not really a Christian. Not really. And all the rest is just an idol, ultimately. So that's what I would have to say here at the end."}

So tonight I'm going to come out against delayed gratification. This is. This is something we've been taught. Christ tells a parable about delayed gratification. It's often labeled in our English Bibles as the parable of the rich fool. This man who's very prosperous, he fills up his barn, he builds more barns, he fills those barns. Finally, he has all of this grain and all this wealth stored up. He says, ah, good, now I'm set. Take my leisure, relax. And God comes to him and says, you fool, you're going to die tonight. And in a lot of cases, we've had the opposite ground into us, where all of the actual living of life, all of the good things of this life are always after a then. And there's always something before the then. You have to attain a certain level of success. You have to get a certain level of education, you have to achieve certain things. Then you can get married, then you can have kids, then you can relax, then you can enjoy life. Then you can have friends and spend time with them. Then you can have some kind of leisure time. Well, you have to work so many years, but then, you know, someday you'll retire, and then you'll be able to enjoy your golden years. You'll be able to."}

There's always this then. And oftentimes what comes before the then is an idol. It's an idol. It's the thing you're using to get a grip on your life and get a grip on the world so that then you can relax and do the things you should do or want to do. Well, there's this other thing I got to do first, because otherwise it won't be safe to do those other things. I can't relax and do those other things, I'll have to worry. Got to make sure everything's squared away first. Even more tragically nowadays, for a lot of us, there's not even a then. There's just what's before it. There's just, I'm going to have to toil away at this until I die. There's just I'm going to have to tread water. I'm going to have to endure this. I'm going to have to survive this for as long as I can. We've realized that those things about retirement or those things about having kids late in life or those other, they don't actually work. They don't actually end up happening. And so there's sort of nothing in front of us but toil and worry and anxiety that'll probably lurch into despair. But what all of those kind of idolatrous calculations have in common is that they leave out God. They leave out his existence. They leave out his activity in the world. They leave out his involvement in the world, the way that he and his very self, right, is active and moving in the world and in us. They leave out the fact that he knows what we need, that he is the one in control of all these things, not us. No matter what handles we find, what levers we pull, it's always him."}

Because often the most disastrous thing God could do to us is to give us what we want or think we want in a given moment. And we worry and we put ourselves into this despair and toil and stress. We deny ourselves the good gifts of God in this world and the good things of this world, because we ignore him and we forget about him. So because God is real, because of the love of God expressed in our Lord Jesus Christ for us is real. We don't have to be afraid. We don't have to worry. We can live now. We can love and enjoy community now. We can have families now. We can have friends now. We can enjoy his good gifts now. It's not even that hard to do. You actually don't need mammon to do most of these things. You can get together with friends and cook food and eat it. It doesn't have to be fancy food. It could be ramen. You can spend time with your kids, your wife, your husband, your girlfriend, your boyfriend, your pals. You can go and talk to and interact with actual humans in person without curating who you are and what you look like and how you come off you can touch grass. Like all of these things are available to us all the time. If we stop for a second from all the worrying and all the anxiety and remember that God is real and that Christ is real and that even when we forget about him, he doesn't forget about us. So when the gratification we're talking about is the blessings of God, is the worship of God, is the love of each other, do not delay that gratification. Do not delay it one second. It's yours now. Because if you delay it, you'll never get to it. That's what I have to say."}
