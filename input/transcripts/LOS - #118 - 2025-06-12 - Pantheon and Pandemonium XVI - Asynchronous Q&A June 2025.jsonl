Well, let's begin with our first half. So this first question is from Deacon Joseph. Hello, dear fathers. This is Father Deacon Joseph from Azel, Texas, as we are once again in great Lent, the conversation has arisen in my circle of friends who are Protestant about Christians attending or conducting their own Passover or Sin Seder meals. I know that you've said in the past in clear terms that in the times of the apostles, those who were Jewish were expected to keep practicing Jewish purity rituals up to and including Passover, since most of these modern Christians who are practicing are considering practicing a Passover meal or a Seder that doesn't seem to be in alignment with ancient Christianity or numerous canons I know we are not to judge those who are outside of our tent, but however, here in America, this question is asked of me directly upon occasion as to why we don't do that. Most online resources will simply state that we don't have to do it, but there's no problem with us doing it as Christians. But most of those online resources, unsurprisingly, are not Orthodox. So I'd appreciate your question, your answer on that. I covet your prayers and I thank you for all your great work. Good strength for the fast. All right. I mean, my. Like, the thing I say to people when they ask this question or something like it is to say pascha is Passover. So it's redundant. At the very least, it's redundant to celebrate it more than once. Pascha is the Christian Passover. And of course, in most languages, that's just one word. You know, Christians celebrate Passover and that's the resurrection of Jesus. But I mean, is there more to it than that? Obviously, there's, you know, canons about don't go and participate in rituals of Judaism because we're not Jews. What do you think, Father?"}

I had to point out to. When I was doing my PhD work, I had to point out to one of the professors in the Biblical Studies department who was talking about. So there's this. There's this weird place in the King James version where in the original Greek of Acts, it says that the apostles gathered in Jerusalem to celebrate Pascha. And the Original King James, 1611. King James translated that as Easter. And so the professor was like, this is just a weird translation. Like, why would you. And I had to point out, like, Pascha is what everybody who doesn't speak a Germanic language calls that feast. And some of the people who speak Germanic languages."}

You don't care. Precision in communication, as do I. But. So just successfully communicating that to people would solve a lot of these problems. But this whole Seder thing is actually emblematic of a whole problem in American evangelicalism, which is. So if you know the reality of the history and you could look at the work of like Yuval Israel, who's a Jewish scholar of Jewish liturgics. Okay. Agrees with this one I'm about to make. The modern Passover Seder deliberately borrows elements from the Christian Eucharist. They borrowed elements from Christianity informing the Seder service as it's currently celebrated. Meaning when you had that demonstration at your evangelical church and they talked about, oh, look at all the, the symbolism pointing to Jesus in this Passover Seder, it's because it was going the other way.

It's almost like you say, well, okay, I'm going to celebrate Christian Christmas, but before I do that, we're going to do Japanese Christmas like a few days before, because we want that version too.

We don't want to dabble in Roman Catholicism or something, as if that's the only place that has that. But I mean, becoming an Anglican would be bad enough for a lot of these folks, let alone Orthodox. But being completely severed from that and not willing to really delve into it, then they go to the Jewish stuff. And so you're sitting here parsing the words of the modern Seder, trying to connect it to Christ. You know, it's directly connected to Christ the way we celebrate the Eucharist in every divine liturgy. So to me, that's the bigger issue. The bigger issue is a bunch of evangelicals who have, I mean, it's not like they, the current generation of evangelicals, choose to sever themselves from Christian tradition.

Okay, our next question comes from John who has a question about the dedication prayer that Solomon delivered at the building of the temple. Hello Fathers, this is John from Allegan. I have a question concerning Solomon's Prayer of dedication in Third Kingdoms. And Father Stephen, you have mentioned previous podcasts that Solomon's prayer seems to be quite self serving, often asking that any invocation towards the temple be, be answered. And I have just read this passage and I'm, and I've seen a couple of lines in the text that stuck out that say exactly as you do. But I've also noticed that there are several lines that talk about when, when famine come because the people of Israel has turned their back on God, when we're plagued by the invasion of foreigners, when we've sinned against, you know, the Lord, you know, let us turn to the temple and let us pray. And that language seems to be more common than the language that you've emphasized that seems to be more self serving. Could you elaborate a bit more on this text? Maybe there's something I'm missing in translation, but could you talk more about Solomon's Prayer and maybe give some specifics about why this prayer is far more self serving than it is actually an accurate depiction of what the people of God have done and continue to do as they turn away from God and sin against him. Thank you. Yeah, this is one of those things that I think if you just read that passage, it may not be super obvious what's going on there and why there's a distinction between what Solomon says and then how God responds to him. Tease that out for us, Father."}

That's the place where you find that is by comparing what Solomon says and then what God says in response. Because what you have to understand is even, even the things he mentioned there about, oh, he sinned, so he turned to the temple. Temples, especially temples like the one Solomon built, which he built after the, the Phoenician pattern were understood to be the, the building itself was understood to be a body for the God."}

You see, even in the parts that our caller is referring to as the better parts, it's always turned toward the temple. Whatever they pray to the temple, whatever. The temple, the temple, the temple.

But what that means is he's talking about not being contained. He's not saying. Because then he goes on to say he's going to be president of the temple. So what does that mean? What it means is he's not contained by it. Think about how idols function. They're used to contain and manipulate and control a spiritual being. So God is saying, that's not how the temple is going to work. Nevertheless, I will be present here in this temple among you, and when you come and repent, I will forgive your sins. And when you do these things. But the place where this becomes really key, and you really see this is at the other end of Israel's history. Judah's history, really, by that point, is in the book of Jeremiah. Because in the book of Jeremiah, you've got a whole bunch of people saying Jeremiah is a false prophet. Because they're saying God's not going to let his temple be destroyed. We don't have to worry about the Babylonians. They're using the temple in this sort of talismanic way, the same way they tried to use the Ark of the Covenant, remember when it got captured? Just take it out there, we'll win. Right?"}

Hello, fathers. I have a few questions about dancing. This is a topic close to my heart because I'm a caller of square dance and contra dance. I met my husband through a contra dance community before either of us became Orthodox. Our church in Nashville has a lovely Greek dancing program showcased at the Greek Festival each year. I love community dance and have seen people find much joy and fellowship through it. So, first, why do the saints have so many negative things to say about dancing? For example, St. John Chrysostom, in his writings on marriage, strongly discourages dancing at weddings. And in light of this, can there be a place for dancing in a healthy Orthodox Christian community? If so, what potential pitfalls should one watch out for as a Christian who loves to dance and teach others to dance? Thank you so much for your show and for providing a place to ask these questions. All right, I have to begin by saying that I still. Even though it's been over 20 years since I was a stagehand, I still have some level of PTSD dealing with. With dancing school, dance schools, when at the theater where I worked. So pray for me, you know, and all of you dance moms out there, you know exactly what I'm talking about. I mean, number one, there's dancing in the scriptures, in the Psalms, even. There's references."}

I need to see pictures of this. All right, moving on to the next question. This is from George, who has a question about the throne and in Elam. Greetings, podfathers. Christ is risen. My name is George. I live in Virginia, and I am an original listener. Been listening since the very first Lord of Spirits podcast dropped, but have never called in. And I have a question about Elam. So recently I was reading Jeremiah, and I came across in my orthodox study Bible prophecy about Elam, where the prophet prophesied destruction for Elam, and then the prophecy ends. And this is in chapter 25, verses 18 through 20. Then I will set my throne in Elam, and from there shall send forth the king and his nobles. It shall come to pass in the last days that I will bring back the captivity of Elam, says the Lord. This word concerning Elam came in the beginning of King Zedekiah's reign. I also noticed that this prophecy is not included, at least as far as I could find, in the Masoretic text of Jeremiah that I have in my English Standard Version. And it's kind of bewildering to me because I don't know what the significance of Elam is and what it means that God will set his throne there or bring back the captivity of Elam. Was hoping that maybe you could shed some light on it. Thank you very much. And again, Christ is risen. All right. So I actually just noticed that and maybe disconnected, I don't know. Tell me that in our reading for Pentecost, that when we're recording this Pentecost is yesterday, that there's references to people in Jerusalem who are Elamites, who are Judeans, who are hearing the Gospel in their own language."}

We know he had a scribe, Baruch, who recorded things. And both versions were compiled after Jeremiah's death. We also have the Book of Baruch in orthodox Old Testament. Lamentations is in obviously both. And then the Epistle of Jeremiah is in the orthodox Old Testament. So there's this parallel hominin, Jeremias, meaning there's this other Jeremiah material floating around out there. And so it got compiled in different ways during the Second Temple period. The Greek that's usually referred to as Septuagint, Jeremiah, which, of course, we've explained on the show why that's. It's not Septuagint, but the common Greek version of Jeremiah is a translation of the shorter version, and the Masoretic text has the longer Hebrew version. We know there are two different Hebrew versions because we found both Hebrew versions at Qumran in the Dead Sea Scrolls, literally side by side. They had both versions and didn't think it was a problem. Didn't think they had to decide which one was the real one. But everything that's in the shorter Greek version is in the Masoretic text, but not vice versa, because the longer Hebrew text is about a third longer, but it is rearranged. It's not just that more material was added. It's that the material they both share is in a different order."}

So there's also this other factor of. Within the book of Jeremiah, if you read it, there's a point at which the original collection of Jeremiah's prophecies is destroyed and then it's rewritten. So that may factor into this in terms of the two versions. And, of course, plenty of journal articles theorizing how they're related. Right. Dissertations. But. Yeah. So that's why you have things. Radically different chapter numbers. And you'll have stuff that's in one order in one version, in the reverse order in the other one. So that is to say it's in the. It's in both versions. It's just hard to find sometimes when you're going from one to the other trying to locate where the verses are. Elam is in Persia. So the prophecy there that he will set his throne in Persia and reverse the captivity is a prophecy about Cyrus. And as we talked about in our series on Israel, when that captivity ended, not everybody went back. There were people still living. There are still today. Not as. Not very many anymore, but Jewish people living in Iran, living in Persia. So that's why there were Elamites there. So there we go at Pentecost."}

Because, right, like, you bring about repentance. It's not that you have to hit some certain repentance bar and then you're in. And if you don't hit that repentance bar, you go to hell. Right? Well, you repented, but not quite enough. So to hell you go, well, you repented just enough so you made it into heaven. Even though, obviously.

But he's trying because the Plato stuff is part of the Christian tradition he had received in the west from the Platonist period of Western theology. Think Bink Anselm. And so he's tried to reconcile those things. And yes, I know he didn't actually finish writing the third part so we could just describe it to that. He probably would have worked it all out brilliantly but didn't get to. But it makes my point that there is sort of this tension in that.

All the bricks that made it up are still laying there in a pile, but it's now a pile of bricks. The tower doesn't exist anymore. That's closer to how I was using the ancient in the ancient world.

But I wonder if you could comment on why some saints seem to be associated with certain types of healings or requests. I know that in orthodoxy this is not as developed as it might be to have patron saints over certain things or professions.

But Paul operated during his entire life as a faithful Pharisee within the Roman Jewish world. In St. Paul the Pharisee, Jewish apostle to all nations, Father Stephen DeYoung surveys Paul's life and writings, interpreting them within the holy tradition of the Orthodox Church. This survey is followed by DeYoung's interpretive translation of St. Paul's Epistle, which deliberately avoids overly familiar terminology. By using words and ideas grounded in 1st century Judaism, DeYoung hopes to unsettle commonly held notions and help the reader reassess St. Paul in his historical context.

This is from Nicholas. Hi, Fathers. This is Nicholas from the Netherlands. I was talking with a fellow parishioner and friend about politics. Terrible. I know he expressed his concerns about this and that political or environmental problem. And I said, well, if those people are indeed doing bad things, then God will turn that into something good. My friend, however, was convinced that God simply allows bad people to do bad things because of free will, even if that would mean those bad people would destroy the entire creation. And so, according to my friend, we good people must stop the bad people from doing the bad things, because otherwise they will destroy the entire creation. So during this conversation the question came up, does God allow bad people to do bad things for the sake of free will? No matter what the outcome? Is it true that anything that happens to me personally bad and good, has passed through the hands of Christ for my own spiritual benefit? And if so, does that extrapolate to large scale events caused by so called bad people? Thank you for your answer. And Jung van eederlands lehre hu kissen en gemeenschapor de vormer e gordrach.

So. And this is part of the influence of Calvinism on Dutch culture and Dutch Calvinist thing. Like that's an element, right? So there's a certain Dutch stoicism that is the product of the Calvinist idea that everything that happens to you is coming sort of directly from God, good and bad. If it's bad, you deserve it. If it's good, don't let it give you a big head. And so there's just sort of this sort of like grim stoic kind of grim stoicism sort of accepting whatever happens is God's will. That's why I said his, his friend is sort of the opposite extreme, rebelling against that idea and saying, no, we have to sort of take this into our own hands. But the opposite extreme, that sort of Calvinist extreme is also not fully correct. And the key here is that part of our free will is in how we receive the things that happen to us. There is, there's a kernel in that sort of Calvinist view of this. The problem is the Calvinist view also has total depravity involved, which means no matter what happens, you're going to do the wrong thing anyway. To speak more broadly and outside of that specific tradition, anything that happens to you, there are different ways you can receive it. And that will make that thing that happened a good thing or a bad thing. This is part of the part that you play as a person in terms of God bringing good out of evil. So let's say you lose all your money, you suffer financial catastrophe, your account runs off with it or something, or stock market crashes, or you make a bad investment, you end up broke. That can drive you into despair, that can cause you to reevaluate how much importance you are placing on possessions and things in your life. The second one of those could be positive. First one obviously is negative. But it's the same event. It's the same thing that happened to you either way on the other side, right? You could experience some great success or some windfall and get a bunch of money. Depending on what you do with it and how you receive that and how you handle it, that could be the best thing that ever happened to you, or it could end up being one of the worst things that ever happened to, to you. So it's not the thing itself that happened that's good or bad. It's how you received it and what you did with it. If you go, like you mentioned, certain saints who have been through certain struggles, and so now they're able to identify, or you're able to identify with them when you're facing similar struggles that can happen to you, you can go through certain struggles in your life that can make you able to help and counsel other people who are going through similar struggles for the rest of your life, or you can let those struggles, you know, shipwreck you again. That's. That's how you receive it."}

And this is in the period where iconography is being removed from synagogues, probably for related reasons. Synagogues up into the third century had iconography all over them. Old Testament scenes.

The temple has to be cleansed and restored so that God can come to dwell in it again. And St. Paul talks about our bodies becoming the temples of the Holy Spirit when he comes to indwell us after we're baptized into Christ and die and rise again.

Like Saint Maximus will take an image and just give a dozen different allegories, anagogies, and they're all valid. So I'm wondering, I'm kind of following up on something like Psalm 82, where you guys had a disagreement on whether you can apply. Whether the saints can apply an image that doesn't necessarily align with your quote, unquote, original context. Is that possible? Or do we say, no, they were wrong in that case? Or is it more like an unfolding of the image in sort of contemplative ways that are helpful to people in their specific situation? Like there's a line to be drawn there somewhere. So I'm wondering where it is, where the balancing act is. So thank you guys, Much love."}

Whereas if you look at the church fathers, they're often taking these things and applying them in multiple ways. And sometimes. And if you were to line them up as a list of things, that this is what this passage means, then you could say, well, the church fathers disagree with each other because this one says this to these people and he says this, and this other one says this to these people, and they're not identical. It's not the same. And yet I think this is what's key. They're all compatible with the orthodox tradition, even if they're not saying identical things to different people. Does that make sense?

So on one hand, part of what we have, and we've talked about this in terms of how prophecy actually works, works, is that you see in the Old Testament a lot of patterns.

But if you think about them as patterns, obviously patterns by definition could be sort of applied and fulfilled in various ways at various times. So sometimes the."}

So an example I'm thinking of is the bush that was burning and not consumed, or Gideon's fleece. We were just talking about Gideon. But the bush that's burning and not consumed gets used for a whole bunch of things. Right. When we talk about the sacraments, that image gets used. When we talk about the conception of Christ, of the Theotokos and her burying him in her womb, we use that same image. Well, which is it an image of? Well, it's an image of God's creation becoming the vessel for the presence of God and not being destroyed or consumed by him and by his holiness. So that pattern has a whole bunch of fulfillments, like the sacraments, like the Theotokos bearing Christ in her womb, like the tabernacle and the temple. Right. And then those things are connected to each other. And we talk about those in various ways. The other piece, besides sort of the application of patterns, is a lot of times we're missing pieces. We're missing steps in the argument between what something meant in the original context and how it's being applied. So if you don't know that lift up your heads, O ye gates has something to do with the BAAL cycle, which we didn't for a long time, then it looks like our hymns and the Fathers are applying that verse really allegorically and weirdly, because they apply it to the Ascension, they apply it to the heroic of Hades, both, which is it? And they applied in sort of these weird ways. If you understand that this is coming from the BAAL cycle and you understand something about baal, then you have sort of the middle term of the argument that you were missing before, and you say, oh, that's why they're applying it that way. So Psalm 82 is about theosis in that the groundwork for theosis is that humans in Christ are exalted and take the place of the fallen spiritual beings who are judged. In Psalm 82, there's not an either or. Either this is about Christ judging the gods the way it's interpreted on Holy Saturday, or it's just about theosis and they're just taking it allegorically. I've called you gods because saying it's about theosis doesn't make any sense in the context of the whole Psalm. If you just do it directly, yeah, I called you gods, but you will die like men. People who have undergone theosis, what, get killed by God, what. There's a middle term of that argument that you have to know in order to understand what the Fathers are doing. The Fathers are so familiar with that. In the same way that we talk all the time on this show in our churches, we talk about things without laying out the whole argument. Right? We don't lay out the whole monarchical model of the Trinity every time we invoke the Trinity. But if someone asks us to explain, well, wait a minute, how does that. I thought you said, you know, you just said to Christ, thou art our God, and we know none other beside you. But what about the Father and the Holy Spirit? Well, then we answer that question and we explain what that means. But we don't lay out the whole argument every time we. We refer to the Trinity. So the Fathers don't lay out the whole argument every time they. They refer to a passage. But that doesn't mean they didn't have an argument to get from A to B. Those are the couple things I would add."}

And so I'm wondering if you could expound on where scripture shows how angels could be talking to us and providing positive guidance. Thank you. Okay. To me, the distinction, he points out very, very well. I think that in many cases in the Bible, people see an angel and so they know that the angel is talking to them because they actually see the angel. Of course, there's a lot of cases in the history of the church where saints see angels. But when you think a good thought, when you have a good thought, it may not be very apparent. And one of the thoughts that I'm having about that is, does it super matter where the good thought comes from if it's a good thought? I mean, what's the sort of the practical application of trying to make this distinction? I don't know. What do you think?"}

Yeah, that's the core of it. The core of the question is how do I determine whether this is directly from God himself or from God through an angel? Because all good things come from God, so ultimately it's from God. So we know in our experience. Right. Our life of experience, most of the time, God works in our life through means. It is very, very rare that God talks to someone directly. And when that happens, you know, it's not ambiguous and. Right."}

And so in the same way, if an angel whispered to you a good thought or an insight, that wouldn't be different than. I mean, that would still be from God.

But as we've talked about in terms of the book of Genesis, humanity is created to put the creation in order and fill it with life. Those are the two things. Each one of the partners has one of those things that they major in, and then they participate in the other one. And the one that women major in is the filling things with life. And we've talked about how that's. That includes but is not limited to giving birth. That's sort of a very obvious. Women are the ones who give birth. Sorry. Various people in the 21st century give birth to new human life, but also they fill things with life in other ways. And we've talked about how when those things go wrong, you can have a kind of toxic masculinity that is, you know, tyrannical order, violent order, without life that is destructive to life. You could also have a toxic femininity, meaning something that's full of life. But the life. There's no order. It's chaos. It's out of control. Not to sound like Jordan Peterson here. By that, I don't mean doing a Kermit the Frog impression. I mean the whole feminine chaos thing, not going all the way down that road, but just that's sort of when it runs amok. And so there is therefore a kind of connection between disfigured or evil femininity and the kind of beings that demons are. So there is. There is a kind of dovetailing there."}

There's multiple callings out going on here where he's heard you talk about. I think this is from whole counsel of God, maybe. I don't remember if you've said this on this podcast, but about whether, if you're hungry, whether it's okay to steal or not. Hello, fathers. In a recent episode, Father Steven mentioned, while answering a question regarding how rules are applied, that when someone is hungry, he can go and take his neighbor's food if that neighbor has more than they can use in order to feed his family, and that this does not fall under the prohibitions against stealing. Yet I could not find anything that seem to support that, and I'm hoping Father Stephen could elaborate and where he finds the justification for this, as I'm very interested. In particular, I hope he can address Proverbs 6, verses 30 and 31, where it says, people do not despise a thief if he steals when he is hungry, yet if he is caught, he must pay back sevenfold, even if it costs him all the wealth of his house. Thank you. All right, well, what's going on there? What is your justification for saying that? Father Stephen?"}

So if you go and look at the commentary on Proverbs 6, 30, both Jewish and Christian, they all use 630. They don't tie verse 31 to verse 30 in the sense that they take verse 31 to be talking about what actually happens in life. Not if you catch someone stealing to feed himself, you should do this to him. And how do we know that? Well, how do we. What do we have as evidence in terms of interpreting that? Well, you notice it says payback sevenfold. That's not what the Torah calls for. Even just a straight up regular thief doesn't have to pay back sevenfold. So Proverbs is describing a system of affairs that is incorrect in those verses. Once again, people can't assume that just because something appears in the Bible, it is being endorsed. Proverbs in particular, the way the book of Proverbs works is it is applying the Torah. It is directly related to the commandments of the Torah. So Proverbs is expecting you to know that paying back sevenfold is not what's required. So when you read commentary on Proverbs 6, they don't say, yes, this is Right. He should pay back sevenfold. They say Proverbs 6, 30. They don't. You don't despise a man for stealing to feed himself when he's hungry. Is an example of the general principle of the Torah, beyond even what the Greek of Deuteronomy says, that to preserve a human life, you can violate any commandment of the. The Torah. And therefore a starving man with a starving family can steal enough food from someone who has more than enough. Not from another starving person, but from someone who has more than enough to feed his family. And it's not stealing."}

Okay, this next one comes from Lexi. This is a little bit of a delicate question in some ways, but I think. I think we can extract out the general thing and respond to that. That. So I'll just play it. Hi, Fathers. My name is Lexi, and I would love some wisdom from you guys. I have been very moved by this podcast and very enlightened. I grew up Protestant. Anyways, I've been married for five years almost, and I just always come back to First Corinthians 13, verse 6, 7. That whole passage about what love is, and sometimes my spouse is not totally honest with me. Kind of a touchy topic. But when it says love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, and endures all things, how do I be a good wife?"}

Occasionally being lied to. I want to believe everything he says and hope for him and bear and endure. But at what point is that stupid? Or should I just love in the flying in the face of, like, worldly intelligence? I don't know. It's such a hard. Do you understand the question? It's not an easy answer, but thank you so much for your help. Yeah. So, Lexi, if you are listening to this episode, we do understand the question. I mean, the first thing I'll say is you should talk to your own priest about the particulars of your marriage. I think that's the main thing to say up front. But. But generally speaking, I don't think that that passage from First Corinthians 13, when it says believes all things means that you go through life gullible, that you believe anything anyone says to you. I mean, there's all kinds of other stuff in scripture about being wise and, you know, listening closely and being able to tell truth from falsehood and all that kind of stuff. So I don't think that's what that means, that you just take anything and believe it or whatever it might be. I. I think it's the word faithful. Yeah, right."}

But ultimately, I mean, it's beautiful because if you read it from the beginning, it talks about if you could do all of these impressive things, but if you don't have love, then you're nothing. And love, of course, is that self sacrificial care for another person. That's what that is. And so within a marriage in particular, because that's the context that Lexi's asking about, husbands and wives are called to love each other in this self sacrificial way. That doesn't mean. And again, we don't know your marriage, Lexi. We don't. So you really should talk about this with your own father confessor, your own priest. But within a marriage, both people are going to be bad to each other on some level, sometimes very bad. And we can still give to them self sacrificially. Doesn't mean we have great feelings about them 24 hours a day or even often, you know, you may not have big feelings at all and still have a good marriage. It does not mean though that whatever happens that you just have to take any of doesn't. It does not mean that. It doesn't mean that. Certainly we have some examples of saints where, and frankly it's, you know, it's almost always women where their husbands were abusive and even maybe killed them, stuff like this, and they are regarded as martyrs and so forth. I would definitely not use that as a blanket application for someone being abused in a marriage. Again, I do not know if we're not talking about a particular marriage here, just generally speaking, you know, our faithfulness is to Christ and we are faithful to Christ by serving our husband or wife. And sometimes you have to kind of shrug your shoulders when they say or do stuff that's wrong or off and you know, just kind of, you don't, you don't have to, you don't, you don't have to. You know, like I said, you don't have to be gullible. You don't have to say, okay, anything you do or say is fine. Because that's not true. That's not true. Absolutely not true. So yeah, that's what I have to say about that. Thank you for that correction in the translation, Father. I don't even know why that didn't occur to me, because it's not like we haven't harped on that a thousand, thousand times on this podcast before."}

And what it means to love someone. Right. This is why it's possible to love everyone. This has nothing to do with feelings. This has nothing to do with liking people. You're not called to like everyone. You're called to love everyone. This is a different thing. To love someone means you do everything within your power to help them find salvation.

Okay, but being super blunt, right. Does believing someone's lies help them find salvation? Does allowing someone to continue sinful behavior toward you or other people, does that help their salvation? Does letting someone remain unrepentant help their salvation? No, quite the opposite. If you love someone, you want to help them find repentance, you want to work things out, you want to make peace, you want to help them do better and be better. Right. And ideally, in a Christian marriage, that's a two way street. Right. Which means it requires humility of us too. I have to be willing to grow and change and repent and be corrected to not just, oh, I'm going to straighten out my spouse, right. Who, you know, messes up all these things, unlike me. Right? That's not how that works. It's a two way street. But you can't have repentance without accountability. Right? And we get this with kids. Like, if you just accepted and tolerated any behavior from your kid, that wouldn't be a sign that you really love them. But for some reason, when we're talking about other adults, we seem to think that if I don't just accept, however this other adult wants to behave toward me and other people, that I don't love them, somehow your teenage kid might throw that you hate me, you know, whatever. But that's adolescent nonsense, right? So, yeah, we have this really wimpy understanding of love, right? And that's not. I mean, maybe it's, you know, I'm just gonna go wherever things take me. I think it may be based on a really wimpy version of Jesus that is very popular in Protestant evangelical circles of seeing Jesus as just this victim who just gets abused and just takes it, instead of seeing Christ as the one who conquers hell, who goes to his death voluntarily and endures all these things voluntarily so that he could be victorious and set us free and rescue us, his bride, the church. That's a very different view of Jesus. Right? And what love is. Love is this heroic thing. Love requires, like, strength and virtue from us, Right? It's not just sort of a passive or receptive thing where we sort of tolerate everything that happens to us and just, you know, I gotta. I gotta love everybody. I gotta accept them just the way they are. Get out of here with that. Toughen up. Man up, evangelicals."}

In the episode on purification. So what does it mean for Mary to have been a physical virgin after giving birth? Because if we're going solely off of the hymen not being ruptured, then that would mean that certain women who. Tampons and menstrual cups but have never had intercourse or been otherwise in chaste might not be physical versions. And then in the reverse situation, there are some women who have had multiple partners and never bled. So what does that mean, to be a physical virgin, then? Thank you. I mean, number one, physical virgin is not a category in our. Like, that's not a phrase. It just talks about virginity. And certainly the sense of the virginity of the theotokos. I mean, frankly. I mean, this is a little. We're a little squeamish about this language now. But frankly, in our hymns, it's pretty clear that part of what's being talked about is, as Bethany mentions it, that there's not a physical rupture there. But I think one of the problems is then to extract that set of language that surrounds the theotokos and say, okay, this is the definition of what it means to be a virgin that we're going to apply to everybody else. That to me seems a problem. What do you think, Father?"}

The first thing I'll say is, and we've said this a number of times, but I think it's maybe important to underline this again, is that with. With giants, it's not just the circumstances of their conception and birth that make them giants. Even if that might be the things that's. That pagan stories say about them.

I don't think, Gigi, I don't think that children who are conceived through whatever these other means have some kind of taint on them. I don't think that. So no squickiness required. I just don't think that that's true. Setting aside whatever moral issues the people involved in doing that were, I don't think that the children conceived in that way have some kind of mark, you know. All right, our final question for this Speak by Palooza. And this comes from Steve. Hello, this is Steve from Philly. In the spirit of cooperation or fostering good ties, I do wonder if it would be possible for the Orthodox and Christian or Catholic churches to recognize each other's saints, even as an example. I just. I feel that there's some Catholic saints that Orthodox parishioners could learn from and vice versa. Anyways. I don't know what you think about that. Maybe you can talk about a future show, but either way, thank you. Goodbye. Okay, so is it possible for the Orthodox Church and the Roman Catholic Church to kind of trade saints, you know, line up saints from the other side and go ahead and just bring them in? I mean, on the one hand, there are orthodox saints who were never part of the Roman Catholic communion, whom the Roman Catholics have added to their list of saints. Right. Particularly Eastern Catholics have a number like this. There are some, and it's been controversial in the past, but there are definitely some that venerate St. Gregory Palamas, who his theology in many cases was directly aimed at Roman Catholic disagreements. And I've even heard of some that venerate Saint Mark of Ephesus. But there are other examples too that are probably less controversial. For instance, the three martyrs of Vilnius, who are 14th century orthodox martyrs. They are on the Roman Catholic calendar of saints, particularly in. See, we went almost the whole episode without me mentioning Lithuania, but particularly in Lithuania. Aren't you proud of me, Father Stephen? We dedicate a whole half to Dutchness there."}

But that did not last. It did not last. But I mean, there were even, you know, hymns written to him and a feast day and all that kind of stuff. It did not last. So one could quite reasonably say that the church tried it and said no, but there was a."}

I'm sorry, should I just say Thomas? Anyways, that guy, there was definitely an interest in him amongst some Orthodox for a while. But I think that, like Steve says. Okay. I think, you know, there could be things that could be learned. I mean, I agree there's things that could be learned. I learned stuff from all kinds of sources that are not. That don't necessarily have an Orthodox label on them. But venerating saints is not just about learning something from them. It's about having a feast day, you know, having their hymns, having icons, all of these kinds of things. And at least in the Orthodox Church, canonization of a saint, part of what's going on there, not the only thing, but part of what's going on there is that this person is being held up as an exemplar of the Orthodox faith. Faith and someone who is not an Orthodox Christian. It's really hard for us to hold them up as an exemplar. How could we. That doesn't make any sense."}

So I can't even be a. I can't be a good one because I'm not one at all. I mean, maybe someone could learn something from me. A Catholic could learn something from me, potentially. But I should not be honored as a good Roman Catholic because I'm not one. And so it's funny, you know, the Orthodox have a much less defined method for recognizing canonizing saints than the Roman Catholics do, where there's a whole sort of system, stages and titles that kind of accrue to different stages. We don't have that. And yet it does seem that we are more conservative about who gets canonized, who gets held up as a saint. It's just a problematic thing, you know, to attempt that. There's at least one example that I know of, and it's somewhat controversial one, too, because some people say that's not how it happened. But my best understanding of Saint Isaac of Syria is that canonically he never belongs to what we regard in that period as being the Orthodox Church, that he canonically belonged to the Church of the east, which was full of Nestorians, although there's no indication that he himself was one theologically, but that, you know, where he was a bishop, where he was a monk, was not a territory where there was an Orthodox presence. I know it's controversial. There are people who say that's not true. He definitely was, and that's not the point that I'm making. But. But even if it is true that he did not canonically belong to the Orthodox Church, and of course, now we do venerate him as an Orthodox saint, that is a very rare kind of thing. And to do that with the Roman Catholic Church would just be freighted with all kinds of difficulties. So I. I don't see it happening. And I don't think, you know, if it's for the point of diplomacy or whatever, I don't think that's good diplomacy. You know, I don't think that's good diplomacy. We need to get on. We need to be on the same page with regards to dogma and practice. And, you know, truly, we. We have to believe that we are one. One Christian faith and all of the important particulars before we can restore communion, you know, before we can do any of that kind of stuff. So. So I'm happy that the Roman Catholic Church has decided to recognize a number of Orthodox saints, but it's just not going to work. The other way. It's just not. It's not because we're not mean. It's not because we're mean. Oh, maybe we are mean, but it's not because we're mean. It's because of what our understanding of the role that a saint plays in the life of the church that they are. These are the best Orthodox Christians, and if someone's not even an Orthodox Christian, then we can hardly add them to the list of the best. It would be like saying that the Queen of England, as awesome and lovely as she was, that she's a really good American, she's just not an American. And that's okay. So I don't know. What do you have to say about any of that, Father? Well."}

But that will be from the self understanding of a potential future autocephalous Orthodox Church. Yeah. And her Synod of Bishops. And that will be part of the reevaluation and baptism of the culture of that place and those people."}
