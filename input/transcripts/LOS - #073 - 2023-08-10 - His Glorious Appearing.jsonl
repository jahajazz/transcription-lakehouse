And he will be the light of the nations and the hope of those whose hearts are troubled. All who dwell on the earth will fall down and worship him. And they will praise and bless and celebrate with song the lord of spirits. First Enoch, chapter 48, verses 4 through 5. The modern world doesn't acknowledge, but is nevertheless haunted by spirits, angels, demons and saints. In our time, many yearn to break free of the prison of a flat secular materialism, to see and to know reality as it truly is. What is this spiritual reality like? How do we engage with it? Well, how do we permeate everyday life with spiritual presence? Orthodox Christian priests, Father Andrew Stephen Damick and Fr. Stephen DeYoung host. This live call in show focused on enchantment in creation, the union of the seen and unseen as made by God and experienced by mankind throughout history. Welcome to the Lord of Spirits."}

You are listening to the Lord of Spirits podcast. My co Host, the Very Reverend Dr. Stephen DeYoung is with me from Lafayette, Louisiana where it is a 1000 degrees and 200% humidity. And I'm Father Andrew Stephen Damick in the cool, clear, lovely Emmaus, Pennsylvania. And we're back live. So if you are listening to us live, you can call us at 855-237-2346 and you can talk to us and we're going to get to your calls in the second half of the show. It's great to be live again after the last two pre recorded episodes in July. Although next time we're going to have to do another pre record as I will be away. Oh well, tonight though, being the country, I know I'm. I'm headed across an ocean. Yeah, yeah. Tonight we're going to continue our series on eschatology. We're talking about what is commonly referred to as the second coming of Christ. But is that the right way to refer to it? And why is the Messiah coming twice anyway, after the ascension, are we just sort of waiting around for him, trying to hang on until he comes back, or is there something happening? So Father, are we just in pause mode while Jesus is off doing something else for a while?"}

So, yes, the return of Christ, which we're actually going to start talking about. I mean, I know we've now just wasted a bunch of your time with that whole intro, but we are actually going to start talking about the topic here in the first half. Yeah, there's that."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #073 - 2023-08-10 - His Glorious Appearing","start":552.45,"end":554.17,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"So we're balancing that out a little bit."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #073 - 2023-08-10 - His Glorious Appearing","start":554.49,"end":628.91,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Yeah, there's that. And obviously this is sort of a critically important part of our eschatology series. And we've obviously also already alluded to it. We alluded. Alluded to it back in the Antichrist episode where we talked about the Antichrist being destroyed by the breath of his mouth at Christ's appearing, we talked about it obliquely in the millennium episode, obviously Last Judgment, Christ is the judge. Right. But now we're sort of going to go head on to this and there are a number of issues surrounding this. They got to give people the lay of the land of why this is something that needs to be addressed. Because probably a lot of our listenership, since the majority numerically of our listenership is in the United States, the return of Jesus Christ is something that has probably been of an outsized importance in their religious life."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #073 - 2023-08-10 - His Glorious Appearing","start":629.15,"end":642.27,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Yeah, I mean I was just saying in our pre show that I have a digital copy of the late Great Planet Earth by Hal Lindsey and I threatened to read parts of it on air and you weirdly says something about copyright.

{"episode_id":"LOS - #073 - 2023-08-10 - His Glorious Appearing","start":648.23,"end":687.6,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Yeah, yeah, but I mean. Yeah. Idea that Jesus is coming back soon. I mean like literally there's here in America of foreign listeners, there are billboards. You could be just driving down the road and you will see a billboard or some random little sign or even just a bumper sticker or step up to somebody's house and see a sign that says Jesus is coming back soon. You know, or my favorite, prepare to meet thy God. You know, kind of vaguely threatening. Yeah, I mean this is, it's not everywhere present, but I mean it's, it's definitely a thing. It's definitely a part of American culture. This sort of millenarian idea."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #073 - 2023-08-10 - His Glorious Appearing","start":688.4,"end":790.66,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Yeah. And there are a not insignificant number of sort of parachurch ministries out there who present the gospel in terms of Christ's return. They present the gospel as Christ is returning soon. You need to get right with God so you don't end up getting sent to hell at the Last judgment. Yeah, right. That's explicitly how they present the gospel ending of every episode of Jack Van Impe Presents. Right. Both in his early mustachioed days and his later clean shaven days. Yeah. So yeah, for a lot of people it's taking on an outsized sort of importance. But we're going to be coming at it as is our want more from the perspective of the way it's treated in terms, in terms of discussions of ancient Christianity and the scriptures and the Bible where it's treated as first of all is sort of this weird Christian novum in the sense that it's presumed that there's not an inkling of this Anywhere in the Hebrew Bible or even the Christian Old Testament, that the idea that Christ left somewhere in the ascension and is going to come back was some kind of cope, basically by the. By his disciples to explain why Christ didn't start the Messianic age."}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #073 - 2023-08-10 - His Glorious Appearing","start":792.74,"end":826.27,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"He's coming back and then he's gonna do all that other stuff. Right, right. And because in large part, because it's assumed to be this cope, then it's assumed that while they all expected it to come. Him to come back during their own lifetimes, not in the sense that they thought he could return at any time, but that, like they concretely believed, no, he's gonna come back within like 40 years or something."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #073 - 2023-08-10 - His Glorious Appearing","start":827.23,"end":827.71,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Yeah."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #073 - 2023-08-10 - His Glorious Appearing","start":829.79,"end":852.53,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"And then, you know, there's this whole idea then. Well, once you assume that, well, okay, so then that means that all these ideas, like just the church as an organization or institution, sacraments, all these things, those must all be later after everybody got disappointed."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #073 - 2023-08-10 - His Glorious Appearing","start":852.61,"end":856.29,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Yeah. Because why would you do all that stuff if Jesus is going to come back, like any second?"}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #073 - 2023-08-10 - His Glorious Appearing","start":856.85,"end":906.88,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Right. And therefore, since this was just this cope, it was until that blew up that then they said, oh, well, I guess we need to lay down roots and build this. Build this institution. And then what you would presume if any of that were true would be that sort of the expectation of Christ's return would go away. Which, if you've studied any church history, you know, is not the case. In fact, there have been several significant periods of this kind of fervor that's come around in the. Came around in American evangelicalism in the latter half of the 20th century. Has happened a whole bunch of times in the past."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #073 - 2023-08-10 - His Glorious Appearing","start":906.96,"end":944.25,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Yeah. I mean, just Even just the 19th century in America, like my personal favorite, the Millerites who came out here to Pennsylvania and, you know, gathered in the wilderness, waiting. I think it was, what was it, 1842. Like October 19, 1842. I'm just throwing that off the top of my head. It might be a little wrong. And, you know, Jesus is coming back on this day. And. And then when he didn't, it was called this one of my favorite names for an event ever, the Great Disappointment. And then they coped with, well, he did come back, but it was like in heaven kind of thing."}

Right. Like over and over again. If you actually go back and read, read some of the preaching surrounding the Crusades, if you actually look at what the Crusade preachers were preaching from Peter the Hermit on the Crusade preachers were preaching, we need to go and claim Jerusalem, because once we've claimed Jerusalem, Christ will return to it."}

This is the first time I've said predatorism is kind of dumb on the air on this show. So if there are predators. Laugh. Sorry, not sorry. But this is actually, we're going to talk about is Christ what we commonly call Christ's Second Advent or Second Coming. And we're going to talk about the actual biblical language. This is baked into the cake. This is built into the package. This is in the New Testament. And specifically it's in the way the New Testament reads the Old Testament. The New Testament sees this being in the Old Testament and once you understand the way that the New Testament is reading this out of the Old Testament, once you understand that, there's no reason based on that to think that they thought this was going to be a super short period of time. Yeah, it could be right. But there is no link in this to any, to any particular period of time. And this is not just an issue of there being a bunch of messianic promises that Jesus didn't keep. And so, well, he'll do that next time around. Right. That's not at all what's happening. So the first thing, as we just mentioned, that we have to kind of address is the language. Right. And we talk about Christ's second coming or his return. Part of the problem with Second Coming is a lot of people take that as if it's in, like, parallel."}

And you need to affirm the accuracy of that historical fact or you're not a Christian or something. Right. Which is not how Christianity works, is not how the Scriptures work. We've talked about this before. If you need more of this, go back to our how to read the Bible how and how not to read the Bible episode. But so this also means that we can't interpret. Right. That communication to the disciples who were there at the time, seeing it was clear. But we can't now go in through our 21st century scientific lens and try to interpret this in terms of time and space, in terms of temporal and spatial categories. Right. Like by asking the question, sorry, Calvinists and the extra Calvinisticum, which I know I've bashed a lot on the show, but asking the question where is Jesus? Or where is Jesus body? Now shows you don't get it. Right. That shows that you don't get it. Jesus body is a physical body, but it's not somewhere in the material universe occupying material space. It doesn't need to be. He's God. Yeah, Right. Just like God's throne is not in a particular spot occupying particular space. If you asked about the measurements of God's throne, it would show that you don't get it. Right.

But he was present in a different sense, obviously, with his bodily presence of the myth of the disciples. And this is a little bit brain breaking in terms of if you try to figure out how it works. So don't try. We're talking about God, but this is parallel to, remember, we're told over and over again, especially in St. John's gospel, that Christ's body is the temple. Right. And if you look at the Old Testament, the Old Testament is completely clear that God is everywhere. If I go to the depths of Sheol, there He is. If I go to the top of the mountains, there he is. If I go. Right. God is everywhere. And it's also equally clear that he is present in a special way among his people in the tabernacle and in the temple. So when St. John in his prologue says the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us, and then when he talks about from very early in his Gospel, right. Destroy this temple. I'll rebuild it in three days. And St. John adds the parenthetical comment he was speaking of his body, just in case you didn't get it."}

In the latter parts of St. John's Gospel, particularly surrounding Christ's prayers in the presence of the disciples and then his prayers for the disciples before his arrest, that we read at great length in that first Gospel reading on Holy Thursday, where Christ talks about the Holy Spirit, that the key change that happens at the ascension is that rather than Christ being present in their midst in this physical way, this mode of physical presence where they can see him with their eyes, hear him with their ears, touch him with their hands, that he is now going to be present among them in the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit who is going to come after the Ascension, makes Christ present. And so this language that then permeates the rest of the New Testament becomes a stumbling block for a lot of people in modern translations, because we get this word spiritually, where the Spirit in spiritual or spiritually isn't capitalized."}

And again, the Eucharist is a clear place. We just debates. There's. Well, these groups, Roman Catholics, Orthodox Lutherans, believe in the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist. And Calvinists, who at least the handful who follow Calvin, believe in the spiritual presence or and maybe even some other Protestant groups will use that same language, even though their meaning is even more ephemeral than Calvin's. Right. And yes, spiritual is not as opposed to real, because the Holy Spirit is real and the Holy Spirit is God."}

That's not what it's saying at all. And the key Part there is, what does it mean to gather in Christ's name? Right. That's not just a random phrase. That's not just like the purpose. Like, hey, we gathered this week to re watch Breaking Bad. Next week we're gathering to talk about Jesus, right? That's not just the topic. This is picking up the language from the Old Testament, going all the way back into Genesis, of calling on the name of the Lord. And to call on the name of the Lord didn't just mean to say Yahweh out loud, Right. Calling on the name of the Lord meant worship, and specifically it meant sacrifice. Right. And you can read the psalm verse, I will take the cup of salvation and call upon the name of the Lord."}

So this is, this is referring to the Eucharist, that when Christians gather to celebrate the Eucharist, Christ is there with them. And how is he there? He's there in the power of the Holy Spirit, the core of the orthodox divine Liturgy. This is why for us, the epiclesis is the most important part. More important than the words of institution, more important than anything else, Right? Because it is at that epiclesis where just as the Holy Spirit made Christ present in the womb of the Theotokos at the Annunciation, the Holy Spirit makes Christ present on the altar in the Eucharist. And so again, right. Someone will say, well, wait a minute, isn't Christ everywhere? And we'll say again, yes, just like God was everywhere in the Old Testament, but especially in the temple. Yeah, but especially in the tabernacle. But especially in the person of Jesus of Nazareth, but especially of the Eucharist."}

It became the common Greek because it was biblical Greek. It was the other way. The same way that the Latin vulgate was not like vulgar Latin at the time St. Jerome made the translation, it became the common Latin due to St. Jerome's translation. Anyway, so now that's irritated a bunch of people. Now I got, I got some Latin folks mad at me too with that last little bit, I bet. So all that said, remember how I said almost 100% of the time, this is the exception, Parousia."}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #073 - 2023-08-10 - His Glorious Appearing","start":3150.72,"end":3261.08,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Because parousia gets used a bunch in the Christian Old Testament, the Greek Old Testament never once used for God. What do I mean by that? I mean all the places in the Hebrew Bible as they're getting translated into the Greek Old Testament tradition, all the places in the Hebrew Bible that talk about God visiting his people the day of the Lord, God appearing, God coming to Abraham, God coming to Mount Sinai, God coming on the last day in judgment, none of them use the term paroussia to refer to it. So there is no direct connection to using that Greek term to refer to anything related to the end of days, the Last Judgment, etc. So this is the one case where you do have to go and look at how it's used in the, the Greek surrounding, particularly in the Roman world in the first century A.D. when St. Paul and the other New Testament writers are using it. And the way it was used was to refer to someone being present in person. Right. Them visiting or their arrival. St. Paul uses it this way to describe himself coming to visit one of the churches."}

He makes this contrast between, oh, you know, he seemed bold in his epistles, but then when he was here in person, when he was, when he. Parousia. Right. Then something else. Right. So often it was used to refer to the visit of the Roman emperor or another official, a senator, a general, a governor. And the idea was sort of their."}

So the understanding in the Roman Empire, right? Caesar, even though they believed him to be divine, or at least be possessed by a divine spirit, he was only in one physical place at a time, right? Nevertheless, Caesar's rule or his dominion or his power extended over the whole empire. So that dominion or that rule of Caesar was already in Thessalonica. But then, if Caesar comes to Thessalonica in person, right. That would be his parousia, his sort of bodily presence. And so this makes it a particularly good word for what we're describing here, because remember, the New Testament writers do not see Christ as being absent, right? His kingdom, his rule, his authority is here and everywhere. But there comes a day when he is again present in person the way he was before his disciples on that mountain in Galilee right before the Ascension. Supary is helpful in that way. There are a couple of other words, though, that are used in the New Testament to describe this. One of them is epiphanea, I. E. Epiphany, right? Which means appearing or manifestation."}

And there we see this one gets used all the time regarding God. For example, in the theophanies, when he appears to Abraham, this is the word that's used."}

And of course, theophany is built out of the word epiphany, right? It's just got the theos appended instead of the preposition. But it's also importantly, not just used for those sort of general theophanies, but epiphaneia is used in at least a few places to describe the day of the Lord, that on the day of the Lord, God is going to appear."}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #073 - 2023-08-10 - His Glorious Appearing","start":3478.32,"end":3635.1,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"And Those are in, for example, Joel 2, verse 11 and 31, and Malachi 3, verse 23. So you see, those are fairly late Old Testament books in their Greek translations. And then St. Paul picks up this language. This is where it's often translated in English. His glorious appearing, or his appearing in glory, or the appearance of his glory, depending on how the English translators chose to render it. And Those are in 2 Timothy 4, 1 8, 2nd Thessalonians 2. 8, and Titus 2 13, for example, use that language. So again, it's not that Christ is absent and becomes present again, it's Christ is present, but not in a visible way. And he appears or manifests himself. And then, relatedly, the language of apokalypsis, right? Apocalypse, the obvious English transliteration, which means to reveal or uncover. And this is Used repeatedly in the Greek Old Testament to talk about when God reveals himself to the prophets, to commission them. So, for example, 1st Samuel 3, 7, 21, when he appears, reveals himself to Samuel the prophet. Second Samuel 7, verse 27, he reveals himself to David. Amos 3, verse 7, talks about him revealing himself to the prophets in general. This language is used previous episode, we talked at length about Balaam son of Beor. He tries to curse Israel instead ends up blessing Israel. And that's because in the Greek text, God reveals himself to him in numbers 22, 31, 24, 4, 16. And this language is used to describe this last day and what happens with Christ. That Christ is revealed in 2 Thessalonians 1, 7, 1 Corinthians 1, 7, 8, and 1 Peter 4:13, with this idea that Christ is still present. Present, but his presence is in some way veiled and then gets uncovered."}

That's one of the reasons I like this particular word to describe what's happening. Because, like, he's there, but, you know, like you said, veiled. And then, okay, now he's unveiled. He's not anymore there, but he becomes apparent. He reveals himself."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #073 - 2023-08-10 - His Glorious Appearing","start":3654.38,"end":3718.54,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Right, right. And so you could see, the other thing that this connection through the word apocalypsis brings out is that there's this overlap between the prophetic vision of the prophets in the Old Testament and the appearance of Christ at his quote, unquote, second advent. Right. In terms of what is seen and who is seen and how he is seen. And this then likewise dovetails with one of the orthodox churches called the Vision of Christ and His Uncreated Glory, which is an experience given to certain saints by God. But one of the key elements of it, according to St. Gregory Palamas, is that they are seeing him with their eyes."}

There are Judaism at best. Some people have even said you shouldn't even talk about Judaisms because that implies more organization than the. There was. Right. Like Judaisms makes people think that there were like different denominations or something. Right. That had like structure, internal structures and hierarchies and stuff, which some Jewish groups had and some didn't. Right. And those folks say you should really just talk about the religious beliefs and practices of Jewish people during the period. Right. Which is a different kind of approach.

It seemed like they kind of explored the idea of somebody being, you know, returning in spirit, like as though Christ returned, but he returned in some other human individual and that's his return."}

And, you know, I mean, it says right at the end of the Gospels, you're going to see him come in the manner in which he. You're seeing him ascend. Right. So, I mean, that's one of the things that's kind of funny about all these people who say, you know, oh, this is the second coming of Jesus. I'm like, well, but, like, we have pretty clear description of what that's going to be like, you know, from the angels who speak to the apostles right after the ascension. Right. So, like, it's not going to be some weird secret or, you know, but. But yeah, I mean, I think it's an interesting question, right, that John the Baptist is Elijah, but not. But not. He's not the second coming of Elijah. Right. It's not."}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #073 - 2023-08-10 - His Glorious Appearing","start":4341.87,"end":4507.79,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Yeah, yeah. So. And back in the episode we did about St. John the Forerunner, we talked about the relationship between him and Elijah and how Elijah is more like a patron saint to him. Right. And the idea of the mantle of Elijah. Right. And so, yeah, the two witnesses being Enoch and Elijah in Revelation is picked up actually from Second Temple Jewish literature that talks about Enoch and Elijah because they're the two figures in the Old Testament who don't die, that they return in some capacity. Right. And either finish their life or do something. In the case of Enoch, a lot of times that's connected to. There's one of the very commonplace things in Second Temple Jewish literature and the New Testament is this connection between the days of Noah, right, in which Enoch is in that lead up to when God is going to destroy the world, judge the world under Noah and the end of this age. Right. And so it's considered sort of particularly appropriate that Enoch come back, would come back in that context. Right. The book of Enoch and other Enochic literature that's written in the Second Temple period is really playing with this idea that they believed they were living in the great tribulation following the exile, that they were coming to the end of the age. And so it was like, oh, well, these prophecies of Enoch from the last time the world got this bad, they're particularly relevant again now. And you even see this coming in the New Testament, right. When it talks about Christ glorious appearing and it talks about, you know, as in the days of Noah, people were being married and given in marriage and all these things were. Right. There are these sort of similar comparisons. Right. But yeah, that it's the actual people reincarnated in some sense. Right. Is taking it a little too literally, right. That this, this is about a sort of spiritual dynamic of people prophesying and living and speaking in certain situations. The parallels between those situations and those people."}

I mean, I think it's okay to say, like for instance, the Apolitikan that we sing for the prophet Elias calls him the second forerunner of Christ, God's Coming to us. Right. Which is in line with that tradition of him being one of these two witnesses. And I think it's okay to say Elias will come before the end. How exactly that plays out, I don't really think we know. You know, is that going to be him showing up on Earth again? Him. Him or people acting in the way that he did? You know, like, I don't think we totally know. Right."}

And the first of those is, as Father Andrew mentioned, Psalm 110, 109 in the Greek. This is the most quoted Hebrew Bible Old Testament text in the New Testament over and over again. Book of Hebrews is just a meditation on. It gets quoted everywhere. So it's critically important. If the major theme of the New Testament is that Jesus of Nazareth is the Messiah, this is the key text that's being used to describe what that means throughout the New Testament. And also, I know we talked about this way, way back in the long ago time, like an early episode, like in the fir. Within the first 10 episodes, during one of the episodes I remember we talked about why we say Yahweh live on air. And one of the key reasons we gave is that the way English Bible translations do both Yahweh as Lord and other words that mean Lord as Lord makes it hard to follow some passages."}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #073 - 2023-08-10 - His Glorious Appearing","start":5376.88,"end":5515.63,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Yes, yes. And I mean it. So then, so then after the ascension, what we find through the rest of the New Testament are just repeated references, some of them almost seeming offhand right, to Christ. The fact that Christ that Jesus is seated at the right hand of God. So here's another Jack Van impe list. Mark 16, verse 19, Acts 2, 33, 5, 31, 7, verses 55 and 56, Romans 8, 34, Ephesians 1, 20, Colossians 3, 1, Hebrews 1, verse 3 and 8, verse 1 10, 12, 12, 21 Peter 3, 22. Right. Those all refer to Christ being seated at the right hand of God. And this of course is part of the Nicene Creed that we recite not only that Christ ascended into heaven, but that he is seated at the right hand of the Father. And so when we confess this, make reference to this. There are a number of levels here, right? The first level, the most immediate maybe level, is that we're identifying Jesus as the Messiah by identifying him with his existing Messiah. Traditions of the Messiah, the Lord Messiah being enthroned at the right hand of God. Right? But this also, the fact that Christ is enthroned at the right hand of God speaks to the activity of Christ as the ruler over the nations. Meaning over the world, which is a rule that he shares with the saints, his role as high priest, as you can see in the references I just gave from Hebrews, which he shares with the saints as priests. So there's an activity here. There's something Christ is doing. And so this period of time is not just like a pause. It's not just like, well, Jesus did half of the Messiah stuff and then took a break and then he's going to come back and do the rest of it."}

Right. He rules in the midst of his enemies for a time. He rules over the nations while his enemies, these spiritual enemies, these kings and rulers of the earth, these beasts and Daniel are still active in the world. Right. This is part of what the Messiah was going to do. Jesus is doing it. Right. Is the idea here. This is necessary according to the Old Testament. And so it requires that there be these two different manifestations of Christ, one which culminates in his enthronement and then the second one where he appears to render judgment on the enemies."}

My new book, An Introduction to Extra Biblical Literature, is now available. A lot of Christians today divide ancient Jewish and Christian literature into two categories. What's in the Bible, what's not in the Bible. Christian east, however, has traditionally had a third category, a middle category, books that are read privately in the home. The Greek word for that is Apocrypha. These texts from the centuries before and the centuries after the incarnation of Christ that go beyond even the larger canons of Orthodox and Roman Catholic churches, reveal to us the religious world and theological framework of the apostles and early Church Fathers. In this book, Apocrypha, I survey these works which connect elements of liturgy, scripture, iconography, patristic writings. Familiarity with these works will enhance readers understanding of the breadth and depth of the Orthodox Christian faith.

But yeah, there are other realities tied to this, right. To Christ's glorious appearing, and not just the other topics we've talked about in other eschatology episodes. And part of the key to understanding this is understanding some things about the way Christ's resurrection is described, which of course precedes his ascension and enthronement. And that centers around the language that's used concerning Christ, of him being the first fruits of the resurrection. So, for example, one of the identifiers of who Christ is in Revelation 1:4, there's a whole series of titles there, the surrounding verses, but one of them is the firstborn from the dead. This same language is used in Colossians 1:18. He is the head of the body, the church. He is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead. That in everything he might be preeminent. That's firstborn. First Corinthians 15, verse 20, First Corinthians 15. The whole chapter is St. Paul talking about the resurrection of Christ and the resurrection in General. In verse 20, he calls Christ the first fruits of them that slept. That's more King James for you."}

Which, you know, someone might be thinking, now, wait a minute, wait a minute. Okay, first to rise from the dead. Didn't Lazarus rise from the dead? Didn't Jesus raise a couple of other people? Yeah, the son of the widow of Nain. Yeah, Elias. I mean, there's, you know, the. The unnamed guy who's. Whose body got dropped on the bones of Elisha because, you know, Relics do that sometimes, right? So, I mean, that's. I think that when people think that, which, I mean, it's a natural question to have, right. I think that they believe or they conceptualize that rising from the dead means simply coming back to life."}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #073 - 2023-08-10 - His Glorious Appearing","start":6082,"end":6175.18,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Right? So this is where that first fruits language becomes important, right? Because when St. Paul is talking about the resurrection in 1 Corinthians 15, he's talking about something different than just that kind of resuscitation, right? Just that kind of biological life being restored as it is now, but you're still mortal, Right? So Lazarus died again eventually, as did all of those other folks. Right. That we mentioned. And St. Paul uses specifically agricultural metaphors, right? So a seed goes into the ground and it dies, right? What it was, dies. It breaks open, it breaks apart, and then it becomes something else. It grows into something else. And that's his kind of language for describing the resurrection at the end. So there's this element of transformation, of growth and transformation that requires the old to die, to wither, to be broken away. Right? And so then this is pointing to. This language itself points to the difference between Christ's resurrection and those other people being brought back from the dead. And that Christ is raised and his body is transformed."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #073 - 2023-08-10 - His Glorious Appearing","start":6175.26,"end":6203.27,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Yeah. And also, I mean, this seems like an obvious point, but all those other people died again, whereas Christ will die. No, more like because. Not because like, surprise. Let's just keep waiting and see if he dies again. It's that the way that his body functions, his human body functions, is now significantly different after the resurrection, Right?"}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #073 - 2023-08-10 - His Glorious Appearing","start":6204.47,"end":6222.95,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"And so the first fruits, right, Is the first of the crops to spring up, right? And if you're familiar with the Torah, there's an offering of first fruits. You go and take those first fruits and you offer them to God, you burn them up."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #073 - 2023-08-10 - His Glorious Appearing","start":6224.96,"end":6225.2,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Right?"}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #073 - 2023-08-10 - His Glorious Appearing","start":6226.56,"end":6299.2,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"And this is. We have to. In order to understand ritual, a ritual like this, we have to understand what is the state this induces in the participant. Right. How does this affect what does it do? And how does it affect how the participant experiences the world? Right. If I'm a subsistence farmer, if the survival of my children depends on me having a good crop this year, right. Then when I get that first crop that springs up, my natural inclination is going to be, okay, harvest this, keep it. Because a lot of things could happen between now and the rest of the harvest coming. Yeah, that could wipe out all or most of the rest of it. But then at least I would have this, right? At least I would have these firstfruits. And God says, no, you take those and you give them to me. You burn them up, which requires that person then who is offering that to God as a thank offering. He's offering thanks for a harvest that hasn't come yet."}

And so St. Paul describing Christ as the firstfruits is especially apt here. His resurrection is not only sort of the place where we see what ours might look like insofar as we can possibly understand it, but it is also the guarantee that causes us to then trust that the rest will happen in the future. Also, this connection to first fruits may be the first inkling that some of our attentive listeners might have that this is actually a sneaky transfiguration episode. It's going to get less sneaky as we go through the rest of it."}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #073 - 2023-08-10 - His Glorious Appearing","start":6360.88,"end":6428.05,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"So, when talking about the resurrection, right? Because of course, what happens at Christ's second coming is the resurrection of the dead. And in talking about that resurrection in 1 John 3, 2, St. John says, beloved, now we are children of God. What we will be has not yet appeared. But we know that when he appears, we'll be like him, for we will see him as he is. So the appearing of Christ triggers this transformation of humanity, both the humans who are alive at that point and those who have died. So Christ's appearance then triggers St. Paul's harvest. Right. If that's the resurrection, the rest of the crop coming in. But St. Paul in Romans 8 goes even farther than that, than just talking about humanity."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #073 - 2023-08-10 - His Glorious Appearing","start":6435.5,"end":6490.77,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Yeah. So you've got what, Romans 8, starting verse 19. We're not gonna read the whole chapter. St. Paul says this. For the creation waits with eager longing for the revealing of the sons of God. For the creation was subjected to futility, not willingly, but because of him who subjected it, in hope that the creation itself will be set free from its bondage to corruption and obtain the freedom of the glory of the children of God. For we know that the whole creation has been groaning together in the pains of childbirth until now. And not only the creation, but we ourselves, who have the first fruits of the spirit, groan inwardly as we wait eagerly for adoption as sons, the redemption of our bodies. For in this hope we were saved. Now, hope that is seen is not hope. For who hopes for what he sees? But if we hope for what we do not see, we wait for it with patience."}

And this is in keeping with what St. Paul says, for example, in Ephesians 1, 13 and 14, about the holy Spirit being the down payment on our salvation, the sort of deposit. So to go back to something we said all the way back in the first half, right. 1 Corinthians 15, St. Paul famously talks about us having a spiritual body in the resurrection. And again, as we said, some people take that to mean. Oh, spiritual, like ephemeral."}

So this is a body that is permeated by the Holy Spirit. And so what we're talking about is not just with humanity, but with the entirety of creation being suffused with the light of the Holy Spirit, the presence of God. And so we can say in a certain sense that the Holy Spirit is the atmosphere of the world to come. And since now we're. We've probably pretty clearly outed ourselves to. Everyone is sneakily doing a transfiguration episode. The transfiguration is kind of a weird feast in the sense that a lot of people don't know what to do with it. It's not sort of part of the. Right. Christ is. Is born, he ministers in Galilee, he goes to Jerusalem, he's crucified, he rises, he ascends into heaven. He's seated at the right hand of God. Right, yeah, that's that sort of storyline. The transfiguration is Just sort of dropped in there."}

You know, I checked this to make sure that this was real, because I actually posted about this and a lot of people said, that can't be real. I was like, no, no, no, it's real. The guy who directed that, he said something to the effect of. All these people have been asking me, are we going to have the transfiguration in our show? And then he said, you know, what would that really add to our story? I was like, what now? Maybe he's messing with everybody. I don't know. But I think that's.

{"episode_id":"LOS - #073 - 2023-08-10 - His Glorious Appearing","start":7135.95,"end":7136.99,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Still over two hours."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #073 - 2023-08-10 - His Glorious Appearing","start":7137.07,"end":7789.65,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Yeah, it's true. But, you know, I guess if there's going to be any episode where no man knows the day nor the hour, this would be the one when I get to go home and go to sleep. So, you know. Right. I'm not going to read from late Great Planet Earth by Hal Lindsay. As tempted as I am to do that. But I did want to talk a little bit about the. You know, we ended up with the transfiguration in a lot of this. And I think that there's another angle from which to understand the transfiguration that makes a lot of this clear or maybe gives us just another. Another way to contemplate this amazing, amazing reality that we're talking about. And that is if we think about the Garden of Eden. Right. And we think about also the fact that Moses and Elias are standing there with the Lord on that mountain. So if you think about Eden, Right. And we've talked about this before on the show, but I'll just touch. You know, maybe you guys didn't listen to the spiritual geography episodes, which I recommend you do. Sacred geography, I should say, you know, Eden is. Is on a mountain, which is not maybe super obvious from the Genesis text. Although there's talk about four rivers flowing out, which means at least that it's on an elevated place, because rivers flow out from elevated places. That's how gravity works. But then if you get to it, I think is Ezekiel 28. Ezekiel 28 speaks about when the devil is thrown out of paradise. It says he is on Eden, and then he was thrown down from the mountain of God. So it's very clear that Eden is a mountain in that text. So Eden is a mountain, and it's a garden on a mountain where God dwells with his people. Right? It's the way that God created everything to be. And then let's think about Moses and Elias for a minute. So Moses, who appears with the Lord on Mount Tabor at the transfiguration, he has spoken with God in the Old Testament in the Torah on Mount Sinai, right? In the hymns for transfiguration, there's references to the mountain covered with smoke. Well, that's not Tabor. Tabor doesn't get covered with smoke. That's Sinai, where there was smoke and. And all these other signs that they saw there. And you know, the Lord shows to Moses the vision of the creation and gives him the Torah and he brings it down to the people of Israel. And his face is shining. He is transfigured such that the people can't look at him, and he has to be veiled in order for them to be able to look at him. So that's Moses with God on the mountain, sharing this communion with him. And then also think about Elias. He's on Mount Horeb, and he also has a vision of God on the mountain. It's a little bit different. Moses speaks with the Lord face to face as a man speaks with his friend, but then also has this vision where he can't look at him. He can't look on his face. And then Elias's vision is more like that. He experiences this mighty wind, there's earthquake and fire, and then this gentle breeze, or still, small voice, depending on which translation you're reading. And he hears him there and he comes out and he has to wrap his face in his mantle because he can't look at God and live, right? So Elias also meeting with God on the mountain and having this experience with him, this vision, this communion. So on Tabor, Christ is there. And again, it's Moses and Elias, and they're on a mountain together. And Peter, James and John are there as well. One of the hymns. So if you come to matins which people come to matins. You do not know what you're missing. Please come to matins or orthros, you know, which if you're in an Antioch, you know, the Greek church is on Sunday morning before the Divine Liturgy. If you're at a Russian tradition church, it might be, if they're doing it on Saturday night, paired with vespers, as. As vigil. But come to matins. Okay? One of the hymns of Matins says that, and I'm paraphrasing a little bit here, but it says that on Tabor, Christ is Christ appears in glory with Moses and Elias to show that in the age to come that he will stand in the midst of the gods. That's what it says in that hymn. And so if you look at the transfiguration, that's what you see is going on, that it is Christ ruling over the divine council. And you know, there's a reason that we chose the icon of the transfiguration as being part of the sort of logo of this podcast, because this is what's going on in the Feast of the Transfiguration. And if you understand all of these mountains in the right way, and you understand what it means for. For human beings to be resurrected and to be transfigured and to become truly like Christ, to be adopted sons of God, then you understand that as Father said that we're looking at the resurrection, we're looking at the kingdom. This is the kingdom of God. And what do you know? In the chapter right before it, Jesus says there are some standing here who will not die before they've seen the kingdom of God coming in power. And St. Theophylact of Okrid and I'm sure probably other saints. I know that he said this because I just read it this past week. He says that the reason that Jesus said that in the chapter before is because of what he was about to do on Mount Tabor. Meaning that what we see on Tabor is the kingdom of God. That's what that is. Right? So as we think about Christ's glorious appearing, the transfiguration is not an event that happens in its deepest sense before it. The transfiguration is actually the moment when we see it revealed to us in a partial way. It's not in its total fulfillment as yet, but there is a very real sense in which what is visible at the transfiguration, Jesus standing there on Mount Tabor, Moses and Elias there with him, Peter, James and John with them, who, as some of the church fathers say, they themselves were transfigured somewhat because that's what enabled them to see the transfiguration. That all of this together is what the second appearing of the Lord is about. And it is what we're aiming towards as Christians. That's what Christianity is for, is for that, right? And this kind of millenarian thing that a lot of Christians have, including, I'm sorry to say, some orthodox Christians who should know better, they have this sense of, oh, it's the time of Antichrist. I mean, we talked about this in our Antichrist episode, but. But do you know the scripture? People like, it's in John's epistles, Antichrists have come and are. It's been the time of the Antichrist because, wow, this is the time when the Lord is ruling in the midst of his enemies. So it is the time of the Antichrist and has been for all this time. And the problem with thinking that the end of the world is going to happen any second now, that is literally true. It could happen, right? But if you orient yourself towards that, not in a way where you are oriented to really repent, but instead you're oriented to try and make other people do stuff. You know, whether it's condemning them or pushing them or whatever it might be, trying to cause schisms, messing with parishioners in their churches, all stuff happening right? Now, if you're doing that, then you're not doing it right. You know, if now, if you are oriented towards the second appearance of Christ such that it's like, oh, I need to repent, I need to repent, then you are doing it, right? But the reason that we're repenting is not just like, oh, wow, there's something big and bad happening. I don't want that to happen to me. Although, okay, I mean, again, see our next episode. But really, it's, wow, the transfiguration, wow, the resurrection. I want to be part of that, and I can be part of that. And the reason I can be part of that is because I'm saved by grace through faithfulness. So be faithful, be more faithful, increase your faithfulness. That's what the project is. So as Christ is ruling in the midst of his enemies, as he's driving them out from every corner of the earth, we participate in that by driving them out from the corners of our own hearts, right? Not by treating other human beings as though they are the enemy. They are not. If they are acting like the enemy, then that is because they are slaves. They are slaves to the enemy. And we want them to repent, too. We want them to be brothers and sisters, too. We want them to be with us, too. That's what it means to be Christian, right? Do we love them? Do we love them? It's a good question. So, yeah, there's so much going on here, and in a real sense, all those mountains, Eden, Sinai, Horeb, Tabor. We could also add in Herman and Zaphon and some other stuff if we want to get really deep and weird. But longtime listeners of the podcast know what I'm talking about. All of those mountains and these meetings with God, these dwellings with God, in a real sense are kind of all happening at the same time, the same place. Because whatever is truly righteous enters into eternity and becomes, in a way, permanently present. Past, present, future, beyond time. It's awesome. It's awesome to think about. So, I mean, we should be truly looking forward to the second and glorious appearing of the Lord, but not in a way that's about fear and anger and, you know, hyperactivity and, you know, hyperventilating and other hypers. That's not what's going on here. So it's time to repent. It's time to repent, Father."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #073 - 2023-08-10 - His Glorious Appearing","start":7794.22,"end":8164.09,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"So dovetailing off that a little bit, one of the major important things I think that hopefully we got across tonight is that this period between Christ's ascension and his glorious appearing is not sort of him hitting pause on accomplishing the Messiah stuff. That Christ is that this age in which you and I were born and will live out our lives is a part of what Jesus does as the Christ, as the Messiah ruling in the midst of his enemies. He is active. He is at work in the world continuously. And that means it's also not a pause for us. It's not a waiting room. It's not about doing our best not to commit any sins too horrible before we check out. It's not even just about repenting of our sins in this world. A lot of times we lose sight. Even as Orthodox Christians in the Orthodox Church, there's a lot more emphasis placed on theosis, for example. And anyone will tell you that, yes, we believe theosis is salvation, theosis is salvation. But we still tend to fall into talking about our salvation in mostly negative terms. I mean, there's a reason for that. Like, for me, most of what I'm at work on doing right now, the present moment is repenting of my many sins, right? That's the major way in which, for me, the positive aspect of drawing closer to God is happening is I'm still Working my way out of the mud, right? I'm not at the getting cleaner and cleaner stage. I'm at the extricate yourself from the pit. But there is that other stage. There is that positive, that positive element of our salvation. And that is that contrary to what some of our non orthodox Christian friends at least have in their theology books, glorification, as it's called, is not just something that happens after we die. It's not just something that happens after Christ returns, but it's something that is beginning now. It is something that is active in the world now. The Holy Spirit is active in the world now. And while he has not yet fully suffused the whole creation and my whole being is a person, he is still here and he is still active. And so this life is not just a question of repentance or of enduring suffering and hardship. Both of those are realities for us. But it's also a life in a world where moments where days, where friendships, where marriages, where all kinds of spiritual relationships can be suffused with the light and the love and the peace that the Holy Spirit brings. Where these glimpses of the Resurrection are possible and when they happen, they are real. Just like St. Peter got turned down when he wanted to build the booths on the Mount of Transfiguration and stay there forever. Those moments don't last for us forever. And you can go and read the lives of Saint Seraphim, of Seraph, Saint Simeon, the New Theologian saints who received the vision of Christ in uncreated glory, talking about the fact that even for them, as a great saint, far more holy and closer to God than I will ever be. That vision did not last their entire life. It was a fleeting experience, a powerful experience, but a fleeting one. And these other realities of repentance and of suffering and of joy in this world all returned afterwards. So I don't want to leave off this episode, especially given the topic of next episode. Just going to be kind of a downer, without that positive aspect that the Holy Spirit is the deposit and the down payment of that world to come, that he is here now, that we do receive these glimpses and these moments, and that we can be about trying to infuse through love, through joy, through making peace, we can go out and actively suffuse moments of our life and parts of our life and areas of our life with that grace of the Holy Spirit, even if it is fleeting. But those glimpses we get of glory are what then empowers us to deal with the other harder things that we have to do and we have to endure in this life."}
