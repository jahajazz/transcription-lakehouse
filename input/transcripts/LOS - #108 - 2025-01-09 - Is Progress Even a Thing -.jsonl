And he will be the light of the nations and the hope of those whose hearts are troubled. All who dwell on the earth will fall down and worship him. And they will praise and bless and celebrate with song the lord of spirits. First Enoch, chapter 48, verses 4 through 5. The modern world doesn't acknowledge, but is nevertheless haunted by spirits and angels, demons and saints. In our time, many yearn to break free of the prison of a flat secular materialism, to see and to know reality as it truly is. What is this spiritual reality like? How do we engage with it? Well, how do we permeate everyday life with spiritual presence? Orthodox Christian priests, Father Andrew Stephen Damick and Fr. Stephen DeYoung host this live call in show focused on enchantment in creation, faith, the union of the seen and unseen as made by God and experienced by mankind throughout history.

In order to call something progress, you have to have some idea that there is a direction and a goal, a destination that's being aimed at so that you can judge whether something is progress related to it.

We focused on the idea that even though there's apparent change in humanity and human relations and religion in particular, and Christianity in particular particular, that there is an underlying continuity that sort of undergirds that apparent change. And so we talked about. We really stressed the idea that there's continuity, like throughout the scripture, right. From beginning to end. And we even went sort of before that, we talked about how there's a continuity, there's a religious continuity going all the way back to, you know, your Primitive hunter gatherers, like all the way back, obviously, to your first humans."}

Right. The things that change and how to understand that. Because we take it for granted that the idea of continuity and the idea of change are directly opposed to each other. Continuity means no change and change means a lack of continuity. And tonight we're going to argue that that's not necessarily the case. Also, in a number of past episodes here, where we're going to start, in a number of our past episodes, we've talked about, as exemplified by 19th century Germans, the idea of sort of an evolutionary progress."}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #108 - 2025-01-09 - Is Progress Even a Thing -","start":670.76,"end":795.95,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Yeah. Like, not their vibe. And so, you know, I think most of our listeners, and I think most serious Christians who are even vaguely traditional aren't prone to deliberately going down that road. We may get sucked into it, you know, patriotism and nationalistic fervor and things. We may get sucked into a little bit of that kind of thinking sometimes, but that's not really where we're at. Right. Most, most serious, even vaguely traditional Christians are not going full Hegel. Right. But there is sort of another version of this that we do more often fall prey to, or at least there's a much greater potential for us to fall prey to it. And that's the idea. Not so much that sort of. At least we wouldn't say we're at the pinnacle of all human history. All human history leads to us. Someone pointed out, really, if we were saying something along those lines, we'd go, well, okay, yeah, Right. But we do have this very firm idea, and this is often considered by people to be a Christian idea. I'm going to argue it's not right, but it's considered to be a Christian idea that there is to history, to time, to the existence of this world, this creation, this cosmos, that there is a teleology to it. And teleology, of course, comes from the Greek word telos, meaning purpose or end. Right. Which, yeah, literally means end, but means end in the sense of ends and means."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #108 - 2025-01-09 - Is Progress Even a Thing -","start":796.75,"end":804.59,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Yeah, I mean, we use end in the same way in English, like, that's the end of my day. But also I could say, well, this was my true end, you know."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #108 - 2025-01-09 - Is Progress Even a Thing -","start":804.99,"end":924.36,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Right, right, yeah. There's the end of my day was midnight, or there's the end of my day was accomplishing all these tasks. Right, right. You mean the second one of those. Right. And this is one of. Famously one of Aristotle's four causes is the final cause, the purpose. Right. For which something is made. Right. Something's purpose. So tied in with this idea of teleology, this idea of there being a goal. Right. That all of history, all of time and space, this cosmos, this world, is moving toward a goal, is very much then tied in with the concept of purpose. And that purpose can often be tied in with our ideas of meaning. Right. That purpose, then someone might say, is what gives meaning to various things. So sometimes this is laid out when it's talked about and when it's attributed to Christianity or to quote, unquote, the Judeo Christian tradition, whatever that is, is in terms of philosophy, of history. And this is going to sound very crude, but I can show you plenty of books, history books and philosophy, history books from like the 1960s that present this exactly this way, which is that, you know, pre. Outside of Judaism and Christianity or outside of biblical religion. Right. They will say that ancient people had a cyclical view of time."}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #108 - 2025-01-09 - Is Progress Even a Thing -","start":927.81,"end":1011.78,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"That time of the cosmos. The cosmos just kind of followed these cycles that repeated over and over again ad infinitum, not going anywhere, not necessarily aimed at anything. Whereas they will say Judaism and Christianity, Biblical religion argues that there is a beginning to time and history and space of the universe, and then an ending. And they will say, therefore, now we're going to quit. We're going to interrogate this a little. But they will say, therefore, they will say this is linear time, that time, space, the universe, everyone and everything in it are going from point A to point B. They're on a journey from point A to point B. And therefore there is this teleology and so then if you hold to that kind of view of history, then the idea of progress is a natural outgrowth to it, because history, time, everything has. Has this destination point it's headed toward. If you're moving toward that destination, that's progress."}

If you're headed in the other direction right away from it. Now, it is true. It is true that in order to have a sense of teleology like this, you do kind of need to have. It's difficult to have it without having a beginning and an end."}

If time is a flat circle, then it's very hard to argue it's progressing towards something other than just going around in a circle. Right. But the fact that you have a beginning and an end, and this is what we're going to be exploring more here, is the fact that there is a beginning to time into this universe, at this world and this life, and that there's an end to our life in this world and to this world itself and this age. Right. That does not necessarily mean that it is progressing toward a particular point."}

It's a decent book. Right. Doesn't just start at some random point and end at some random point. Right. There is a. There's a teleology to a book. There's a story that's being told. The narrative is progressing from point A to point B. B. Right. Or if it's a nonfiction book, whatever it's describing, whatever it's laying out, you start at point A and you move to point B in terms of laying out the whole case or the whole. All of the information in an orderly way. But a rock is finite, but does not in and of itself. The rock does not in and of itself. Right. There's not a purpose signified by the fact that this rock is 3 inches in diameter and this other rock is 4 inches in diameter. Right. So you can have a view of time in this world that is not cyclical, but that also isn't sort of moment by moment, day by day, step by step, making advances towards some endpoint. We're going to get into more what that means here, now, now. And this may be a hard set, like you may be hearing me say that and be going, what? Like. Of course it does. Right.

There'll be a list of things and it'll be like, okay, well, all each of these things. Right.

Now, of course, then you also have to take into account Aristotle then had it's on generation and corruption that after things reached that goal, it then withered and died. Because of course he had kind of a cyclical view of everything, right. It's this cycle. You go to maturity and then you decay. But maturity, the kind of maturity we're talking about, Right. Is not necessarily the same thing as we're talking about like biological maturity, Right. That's not the same thing as purpose. So if you run into a 15 year old somewhere who thinks, you know, life is meaningless and everything stinks, they're struggling to find a sense of purpose. And you say to them, well no, you're growing and your body is maturing and someday you'll be 30. That's not going to answer their fundamental questions. Yeah, about the world, Right. They're going to ignore you and go back to listening to Silver sun pickups and crying softly to themselves or whatever they do now I'm old. But to really have this sense of purpose, we have to understand what you're saying, what we're really saying. If we say that there is this sort of teleology to the world, there's this Purpose toward which the world is advancing. We're saying that all of history, all of time, has this sort of upward arc. Now it doesn't have to be a straight line. Right. It could look like one of those graphs, you know, which I haven't seen all that much in real life.

In the sense of purpose, what do you, what do you mean by that? Right. Or what is that purpose? What do. What would you. Do you posit that that is. And there are some. There have been some suggestions. Right. So there's a book, the End of History by Francis Fukuyama, that's kind of famous, slash, infamous, where he argued that history ended when communism collapsed, when the Soviet bloc collapsed, essentially. Because he was a Hegelian of a type. I would say he was a dialectical materialist of a sort. You know, I don't want to. I'm not saying he's a full blown Marxist, but. So his idea was that what causes history to progress and the world to progress and change is this sort of thesis antithesis thing, Right. Which is not Hegel, but a lot of Hegelian types have views that roughly worked that way. And so for him, for example, what was causing 20th century history to progress in the world he's talking about world history and move forward was this dialectical relationship between western capitalism and Eastern bloc communism that they presented. These two in some ways opposed alternatives. Them bashing against each other was what was moving things forward. Soviet blocs collapses. Pretty much the whole world becomes, you know, late capitalist neoliberal paradise or hellscape, depending on your point of view. And so history's over. There's nowhere to go anymore. Nobody can think of any alternatives. This is just it. Right. So most folks I would wager who are listeners to this show would not propose that because that's not their view of history. They're not into the whole dialectical thing. What the kind that comes into Christianity is more the idea that this world, this creation history is going to achieve some kind of final form. Right. This isn't even its final form, but there is one. And that could take a wide range. Right. That could be like a post millennial is that could be like the kingdom of God on earth A and some forms of religious Judaism. That's essentially their end game. Right. They think the Messiah comes into this world and basically just this world is tramp transformed. It becomes really cool. That's sort of process wise. But this could also be completely atheistic. I mean this could be like technocratic. Right. This could be like, oh well, we use AI and computers to like re. Recreate everyone who's ever lived. Yeah. In the great computer at the end of the, you know, things. Or you could go all kinds of."}

Give them a call at 855-237-2346. That's 855 AF radio. The centuries after the Protestant Reformation brought about a radical reinterpretation of The Epistles of St. Paul, disconnected from any historical reality. But Paul operated during his entire life as a faithful Pharisee within the Roman Jewish world. In St. Paul the Pharisee, Jewish apostle to all nations, Father Stephen DeYoung surveys Paul's life and writings, interpreting them within the holy tradition of the Orthodox Church. This survey is followed by DeYoung's interpretive translation of St. Paul's epistles, which deliberately avoids overly familiar terminology. By using words and ideas grounded in 1st century Judaism, DeYoung hopes to unsettle commonly held notions and help the reader reassess St. Paul in his historical context.

There is an end of this world and then there's the world to come. But that, that is an interruption, right? That is not a goal. Toward which things are progressing or being accomplished in order to bring it about. And since that's not a goal towards which things are progressing or which we're doing things to bring it about, that means that there can't be progress toward it. Right. So if you think that all of history is going to some final form, and you think that final form is, you know, liberal utopia, then, you know, you could be doing things now to help bring that about, right? Yes. If you're a post millennialist. Right. You could be doing things to try to bring that about. If you're a technocratic type, you know, you could be working on the AI that's going to someday return everyone to life in the giant mainframe of the future. Right. You could, you could work toward that, all those. And you could have a sense of, well, there's progress toward that and then there's other things that are regressive because they're leading away from that. Right. But if Christ return is an interruption, then you don't have a sense of, well, we're progressing towards or not. I mean, we're progressing in the sense that, like, it's a minute closer now than it was a minute ago, like de facto. Right. But that's not how we usually use the term progress. Right, right. Not progress toward it as a goal. Well, so that said, right. Someone can come to us and say, well, okay, yeah, I agree. You're right. There's no progress. Right. There's no sense of progress. The world began at a certain point, it's going to end at a certain point. That's going to be an interruption. There's no progress. In fact, you know what?

That was the right thing to do. Right. So. Well, how do we explain that? Is that a change? Is that a development? Is that. Because there are people who would phrase that this way. They would be like. Well, Christians sort of came to understand, like there was a development of Christian understanding where they eventually sort of figured out that they needed to abolish sl slavery. Right. Now, part of that, we've already talked about the flawed basis of that in that that's kind of implying that like St. Paul could have or the bishops at Nicaea could have, but didn't because they didn't know they should. Yeah, right. And like their moral conscience, conscious conscience evolved, which we've already talked about, why that's kind of bogus. But also we sort of have to. We have to understand, and this issue and other similar issues give us a window into sort of how this actually works. Because as we were saying at the end of the last half. Right. Ideas co long at particular times because of particular situations. Right. They arise to address those situations, sort of. What's the. How does that work? What's the process by which that happens? And so we have to start by looking at how the commandments of scripture work. And here's what I mean by that. The scriptures, even when we're talking about the Torah. So you could say the Torah is kind of establishing the whole way of life, including the government, the culture, all of these things that we now split up the tour is kind of establishing all of that for ancient Israel. Right. But even in the Torah, it doesn't really describe and advocate particular structures. Right. Like there's Certainly based on the, the. The. We talked about this on the show way back in the long ago time in Deuteronomy. The commandments regarding the king implies that they're going to have a monarchy."}

But they're not commanded to have a monarchy and they aren't given commands as to how precisely, you know, the king's court is supposed to work. They're not giving commands about, you know, how the economy is supposed to function. Here is the economic system you shall use. Right. There's not. None of those structures are sort of laid out. There's not even a family structure that's dictated in the sense that, you know, there have been episodes in the past where we've talked about and made these contrasts and comparisons between the big, large, extended families that existed in most biblical cultures compared to now that's been whittled down to like the nuclear family, if that in our contemporary world. Right. But neither of those are like commanded by scripture. Right. There's not commandments where God says, thine uncle and thine aunt shall live with you into adulthood if they are not married. Right. There's not. Right. Those structures aren't like dictated by scripture. That's not what the commandments are doing. They're not establishing these social and political and economic structures. But the commandments are aimed at is how humans are to act within and relate to those structures. Right. So Israel is neither commanded to have slavery, nor are they commanded not to have slavery. Right. God, of course, knows that they will. Every culture in the world at the time did. Right. But there are commandments given about how slaves have to be treated. Right. And about their release. Right. Same thing is true in the New Testament when we talk about slavery. Right. St. Paul neither endorses slavery as a good thing nor. Right. Nor does he command it to be abolished. Again, as we said, that's not a thing anyway. Right. But he says, here's how you, if you are a person who owned slaves, here's how you have to act as a Christian. If you are someone who is a slave, here's how you have to act as a Christian who is an enslaved person."}

The commandments, when we live by them, right. When we keep them, put another way, when we follow the way of life, when we live the way God has commanded us to live. Right? Those commandments, that way of life is participatory. We're participating in what God is doing in the world, and that is transformational to us. So when I, in whatever situation I'm in, right. St. Paul also doesn't say, like, oh, empire is bad. The Roman Empire needs to be overthrown and replaced with some other form of government. Right. He talks about how to relate to the empire. But when I'm living that way, in whatever my circumstances, within whatever structures I find myself, but when I'm following Christ and living out that way, I am transformed. And as I'm transformed and other human persons around me are transformed by God, this is what we call theosis. We're all being transformed, becoming like God. We're collectively being transformed. Right. That transformation then causes things that were previously unthinkable to us, like abolishing slavery or women are equally human. Right. Those things that were previously unthinkable to us become thinkable collectively, and other things that used to be thinkable to us become unthinkable. So as the Roman Empire is transformed by Christianity, pederasty becomes unthinkable. It was a societal institution that people praised and glorified in the Greek and Roman worlds, Right? And by the time you get into the Christian era, they won't even use the term pederasty. They use a different Greek term that means defilers of children, right? That becomes unthinkable what had been in a social institution and abolishing slavery. St. Gregory of Nyssa looking on Pascha at the people in his congregation who still own slaves and telling them, you are a Christian, you have to release your slave. That becomes thinkable, that becomes an imperative, right? So, yes, St. Paul never says abolish slavery. But if a Christian is living the way St. Paul directed them and guided them to live. The transformation produced by that is going to cause them eventually and collectively to abolish slavery. Right. Because there is this transformation. Right. And then at that point you pass a law. Right. At that point, the structure gets changed. And why does the structure get changed? The structure gets changed because you have to deal with the people who have not been transformed."}

Sorry, Deus fault, guys. Is done gone. I mean, Kierkegaard realized it was done gone. That was like 200 years ago. Now some of these things that had become unthinkable are becoming thinkable again. And we see them reintruding into our society. And we don't understand how anyone could support. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Yeah, well, transformation happens, Right. And this is a.

That's one kind of right change, right. Where we. Like something like, where, you know, change in terms of what's perceived as a change in the Church's teaching based on the fact that there's been some societal change, some change to societal structures, which the Church is now addressing or is addressing differently than it did at another time period, that's this transformational element, Right. Is what's really behind that. And so, again, it's not a change. It's the natural result of. Right. So it's not a change from St. Paul's teaching on slavery to abolish slavery. It is the transformational natural result of St. Paul's teaching that produces the abolition of slavery. Right. So that's not a change. But the other, the other place where people often will want to say, well, here's your incontrovertible example of things changing. Right. In the Church, the Orthodox Church in particular.

Boy, this is a long time ago now, probably 30 years ago, when I first got to university as an undergraduate, I went and got a job at the local theater, as you know full well, Father Stephen, that I did that.

And I began working my first call. And one of the supervisors on the call said, have you done this kind of work before? And I had done it in high school. I had done community theater. And so I thought, yeah, of course I know what I'm doing here. And so he said, okay, great, could you just do this, this, this, this, this? And I didn't catch 80% of what he said. And so I had no idea how to interact with all the equipment that was around me based on what he said. And then, and then he could see the look on my face that I was, you know, some 18, 19 year old git who thought he knew more than he did. He said, okay. And then he, you know, began teaching me the vocabulary that he was using. And then I was able then to interact with this 3D world of theatrical equipment and experience it in a way that wasn't. That was, I could immediately grasp it. Right. Like the language bridged that gap for me. So that I could make use of it, interact with it, and then, you know, make things with it. And that's what allowed. It's not that that 3D world suddenly became different, but I saw it differently and I thought about it differently and I interacted with it differently. You know, I didn't just see it any longer as, okay, there's a series of things hanging from that. I knew what each one of them was and how they functioned and how to use them and all that kind of stuff, you know, and so that's what the. Developing the language. Now, it wasn't new vocabulary at that moment, but it was new for me. It was new for me, you know, and we've all had experiences like this where, like, you. You gain a set of vocabulary and you're able to connect with something in a way that you didn't before."}

There are people who think of God as XYZ or who think of Christ as xyz, and maybe we're even teaching that to other people. This is having a deleterious effect on them finding salvation, because it's not true. It's not who God is. And therefore we will now come up with this idea. We will create this tool, this distinction, which we will use to fix that problem, which we will use to correct that misapprehension and remove this obstacle to people working out their salvation. Right. To people coming to know God more deeply. We remove it by using this idea and this tool. And so the idea, the tool comes about when the need for the tool arises. The need for the distinction arises. But again, the new distinction, the new tool doesn't change reality, does it? Change who God was, doesn't change how salvation works, doesn't change how you as what you as a human person are, but affects experience."}

You have fun. Fundamentally misunderstood who God is and how he works. But go back to those episodes about the continuity for more on that."}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #108 - 2025-01-09 - Is Progress Even a Thing -","start":6747.44,"end":7145.63,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Yay. But, you know, one of the things that I wanted to kind of reconnect with is this idea of what, you know, functional atheism, you know, that any kind of progressive view, whether it's, you know, whether you're attaching politics to it or, you know, theology or whatever, it implies that God is not involved. Or as you said, Father, it kind of collapses God into history. History itself becomes divine. And I made a brief comment about those who like to function as God's older brother, that they feel that God needs to be defended all the time. And why I describe that as functional atheism is that there's no apparent trust that God is acting in this world for the salvation of the people involved. Right. So that's why, for instance, you know, if you're arguing about theology on the Internet, you have to win. And because what's at stake if you don't? That's always a good question. If you're arguing with somebody or you're going to confront somebody is like, what exactly is your plan here to win, and what happens if you don't, and why is it that you need to win this one? You know, And I know some people might say, oh, well, I'm doing it. You know, I'm doing it for the children, basically. Well, you know, the person I'm talking with, they're hopeless, probably, but all the people looking on, I'm doing this for them. But, I mean, that's not the only context in which this kind of thing functions. Right. I had a priest one time tell me, an experienced priest, a good holy man, he said that a saint one time told him, because this particular priest, actually, I'll just tell you if you check out my Orthodox engagement podcast and check out the interview I did with Father Nicholas Paulis, he met multiple canonized saints. So worth listening to that conversation because of all the things he has to say. But one of the saints that he met, I can't remember which one it was now, he told him that he needed to spend a lot more time praying, that his emphasis when people around him were not doing what they should be doing should be Prayer and not pressure, which that's super hard. Although in some ways actually way easier. But it's hard, I'll say, like as a parent, it's hard, you know, if your children aren't going the right direction or doesn't look like they're going the right direction, it's hard not to pressure them, like do what you're supposed to do. It's hard to pray for them, really, seriously. That doesn't mean you shouldn't instruct them, you shouldn't correct them, but if all you do is pressure them, then you have a problem. And I think there's so much of our modern world because of the way that we misunderstand what language is for, that we think language like, like alters the world. Like it's magical, you know, like there's a reason that word faith theology has become big, especially in the last several decades, I think, is because the way that we understand language now, if, if, you know, if we can pressure people, shout people down, cancel people, whatever, then I don't know what then what, some kind of utopia is going to arrive or maybe I'll just feel better about myself because I shouted down the bad guys or whatever, I don't know. But again, it's functional atheism. God is not involved. So I. It's on me. I'm the one. I'm the chosen one, I'm the Messiah. But I'm not and you're not. And if there are things that God has told us to do, but if we're not accompanying it with prayer, then we're not doing it right. Because one of the greatest commandments is to pray without ceasing. And so whatever situation we're entering into, particularly ones where people around us are not doing what they should be doing, which, by the way, that's me too. Each one of us is not doing what we should be doing. But one of the hardest things in the modern world is to be surrounded by people who have. Are not doing what we want them to do, which of course in our minds is what they should be doing. We have to really learn to pray for them and believe that God is at work in the midst of all these situations. We have to, because if we don't, then we really are kind of functioning like atheists. And an atheist is not necessarily someone who doesn't believe in God. Actually, there's a lot of people who believed in God over the history of humanity that have been called by, by saints atheists. And they didn't mean that they don't believe in God, they mean they're without God. They're functioning without God because that's what the word in its most literal and original sense means as someone who's without God. And so my, you know, my, my charge for everyone, especially myself, because I'm lacking in this absolutely is, is going with God. Don't be an atheist. Be a, I don't know, metatheist. I don't know what that might mean, but yeah, I'm using it very literally. Be with God, go in with God and believe that God is actually going to do much more of what's needed than probably, I think I can accomplish what's needed. That doesn't mean I'm not supposed to act. I have to follow the Commandments, but it's not on me. I'm not the one who's going to bring about a utopian world. And in fact, bringing about a utopian world is not the goal of the Christian to begin with. Doesn't mean that we shouldn't try to transform ourselves, our families, our communities and so forth. But we do it by living the commandments and by doing what has been given into our responsibility to do so. That's one of my takeaways from this evening's conversation."}

Christianity at the macro level and the micro level throughout, especially the latter part of the 20th century, in the beginning of the 21st, has been far too devoted to social engineering at the macro level. I'm talking about political involvement. The idea that we need to create these external structures of force that will compel people into certain ways of living or not doing certain things or doing things in a certain way, some of which are legitimately Christian and some of which are not. They're cultural and other things. And we're confused at the micro level. That's like the example Father Andrew gave, you know, I mean, to make sure at all costs that my kid, you know, makes it through high school and probably college without having sex with anybody, doing any drugs or drinking alcohol."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #108 - 2025-01-09 - Is Progress Even a Thing -","start":7252.78,"end":7253.02,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"And."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #108 - 2025-01-09 - Is Progress Even a Thing -","start":7255.5,"end":7616.9,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"When those things are approached at that micro level, and there's plenty of other micro level examples too, in terms of how we want our family life to be and how we want our parish life to be, and then political life, how we conceive of the place where we live at all of those, we address it at the level of social engineering, right? There is an end. There is a purpose we have, right? And now, you know, the means are kind of highly negotiable. You know, if to keep my kid from sleeping with their girlfriend or boyfriend in high school, I have to tell them that they'll get 23 venereal diseases and, you know, XYZ. Other things that, I mean technically aren't true, but that are really scary. If that's what works, let's do it, right? And if we have to, you know, tread over a few people's souls and drive people away from hearing the gospel from the church in order to force their external compliance with certain elements of Christian morality at the political level, so be it. The number one problem with that is how's that working out for you? Which is badly. It doesn't work. But then secondly, even if it did, it's not really accomplishing what we really want to accomplish. Because what we really want to accomplish is, you know, if you're a parent of kids, you want your kids to know Christ throughout their lives. That's what you really want. Those other things are actually secondary to that. And you want your parish to be a godly thriving parish, and you want your family to be a godly thriving family. And you want to live in a place surrounded by other people who are following Christ, right? Or that at least, you know, makes it conducive for you to follow Christ or at least leaves you free to follow Christ, right? That's what we really want. And you don't get that by this kind of external social engineering, by trying to force it or cajole it or use language to redefine it, or salesmanship with slogans or using people's angers or baser impulses, inciting those and exciting those to get them on your side. The only way you get there is day by day following Christ, following the commandments, as Father Andrew talked about, day by day being transformed yourself. And when you do that, and you do that while getting around other people who are doing the same thing as we said, that that forms out from you into a community that's being transformed. And then at a larger and larger level, right, it would be better to live in a culture where abortion is unthinkable than to live in a culture where abortion is outlawed, where there's no abortion because nobody wants one. Not one where there's no abortion, because there are draconian punishments for having one. Pick your social issue, pick your cultural issue. Or we can go down to the micro level, right? It would be better to have your kid not sleep with their boyfriend or girlfriend in high school because they understand what love is and they understand human sexuality as God created it, and so they wouldn't do that. It's better to have them not do it for that reason than to have them not do it because they're scared they're going to get a disease or they're scared of teenage pregnancy. Love better than fear 100% of the time. Sorry, Machiavelli. So that's really what I think comes out of this and is the purpose of what we were talking about, about tonight. Our purpose in the world is not to make progress, is not to build something and then have that thing we built last past our death. Our purpose in this world is to be transformed and to grow in the likeness of Christ and to live in God's love, not all alone, but with other people around us. And when we do that, all of the things we're scared of, all of the things that we're worried about, all of the things that we're tempted to try to engineer by force, those things all end up getting taken care of. Turns out when you seek the kingdom of God, first these other things get added unto you about that. Yeah, somebody told us that would happen."}
