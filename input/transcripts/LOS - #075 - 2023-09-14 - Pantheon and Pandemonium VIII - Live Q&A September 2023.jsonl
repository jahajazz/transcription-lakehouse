And he will be the light of the nations and the hope of those whose hearts are troubled. All who dwell on the earth will fall down and worship him. And they will praise and bless and celebrate with song the lord of spirits. First Enoch, chapter 48, verses 4 through 5. The modern world doesn't acknowledge, but is nevertheless haunted by spirits, angels, demons and saints. In our time, many yearn to break free of the prison of a flat secular materialism, to see and to know reality as it truly is. What is this spiritual reality like? How do we engage with it? Well, how do we permeate everyday life with spiritual presence? Orthodox Christian priests Father Andrew Stephen Damick and Fr. Stephen DeYoung host this live call in show focused on enchantment in creation, the the union of the seen and unseen as made by God and experienced by mankind throughout history. Welcome to the Lord of Spirits."}

Right. But yeah, it's, they're, they're interesting stories. I mean, a lot of what's in there, I think a lot of it is simply historical narration. Right. You wouldn't necessarily read every single bit and say, ah, from this, I take, you know, this significant theological point. Right. That's, that's my impression of a lot of what's in those texts. Although, I mean, you can interpret all of it that way. Like, you can interpret it in a way that's beneficial to you in a spiritual way, but it's not like. It's not like Genesis. Right. It's a, it's a different kind of book than that, you know, where almost, especially in the early chapters, where almost every verse you can make major theological points out of. Right.

But first Maccabees, in addition to giving important history, I mean, I think part of the reason why it got rejected from the Jewish or they didn't really get rejected, why it didn't end up in the Jewish canon, is that it represents a set of traditions that played out very badly across the course of the first century A.D. there was a very common. The common image of who the Messiah was going to be among a lot of common people in Judea. At the time of what we're reading in the Gospels, for example, was John Hyrcanus. And they saw this in very material terms, a welding together of the king and high priest. In very material terms, the overthrow of the Romans. This builds up into the Jewish revolts, which, as I've said before, are like the Matrix sequel or the Matrix movies. There were three of them, but everybody only wants to talk about the first one. And they got worse as they went."}

Yeah, and so there was sort of a. Obviously, as the edges of the Ketuvim of the writings are sort of getting finalized, those borders are getting more strictly drawn. In the early second century, in the wake of the Bar Kokova rebellion, the sort of rejection of that whole tradition of zealotry and of the. That kind of idea of the Messiah, I think meant that First Maccabees was not destined to a long and happy life in rabbinic Jewish circles. Now, part of the reason why I think it's important that we have it in our Old Testament is that there are several points in the New Testament that are clearly reflecting on and in some cases inverting things that are going on in First Maccabees that if you haven't read it, you don't know about the most obvious one, especially since Father Andrew's. Here is the whole episode on the road to Emmaus. Really, the whole ending of St. Luke's gospel is patterned around verse Maccabees. Because of course, the other place where Emmaus is mentioned, the reason it's relevant, is the battle of Emmaus in First Maccabees, which is sort of the climactic battle. So when. When you're talking about these people on the road going to Emmaus, that's like saying they're on the road to Gettysburg."}

And they get to Emmaus and Christ wants to go farther, but they constrain him. Right. And right after this sort of celebration of the Eucharist that happens in Emmaus, it says the way St. Luke's gospel ends is the Disciples are all in the temple praising God. And then you open up Acts at the beginning of Acts, they are not in the temple praising God. They're still locked away in a room. So why does St. Luke choose to end his Gospel in the Temple? Well, because that's what happens after the victory at Emmaus is they go and they rededicate the temple, right? And so there's this deliberate contrast, right? And there's this association of the Eucharist with Christ's victory and this sort of reorientation as Christ opens the Scriptures to them on the road to Emmaus, correcting their view of all this, right? Because they're downfalling. Because they, oh, we thought, you know, Jesus was going to be the Messiah, you know, but I guess not, right? So he has to reorient them. And so having Maccabees there, you know, what the, the text is here is working off of what it's, what it's inverting and redirecting, right? That set of Jewish traditions. And so insofar as our Old Testament is there, as you know, the Old Testament Scriptures are the scriptures upon which the New Testament is a commentary. The New Testament is a commentary and an explanation of the Old Testament. And so first, Maccabees actually fits very well because of the way it's reflected upon in certain parts of the New Testament."}

There's a correct answer to that, though. It's sin. But that's. But even that, through repentance, can become a means through which God works in your life. So the sin itself is not a sacrament, but it becomes the occasion for one. But, yeah, that's a riff on my old mentor, Ed Clowney. Someone asked him once if a particular psalm was messianic, and he said, are there non messianic psalms? But yeah, so, I mean, potentially. So the understanding of the Orthodox Church is that, at least in potency, every aspect of creation and every moment of your life can be a point at which God is working in your life and you're cooperating with his work in your life and in the world."}

And I'm sure you don't have that temptation, Elizabeth. But, you know, since we're talking and sometimes people have this idea that. And they almost paganize them, Right. Like, you have to do everything in this exact way, and if you do it a little different or whatever, then it just doesn't work and it's no longer this anymore. But that's not the way that the church actually functions. I mean, that doesn't mean there's not right ways to do things. But. Yeah, yeah. I don't know. Everything is kind of. Kind of a sacrament. I. I like what Father Alexander Schmemann says in his book for the Life of the World, where he talks about the whole world as being secretly sacramental, and that what the church does is sort of reveal it to be what it really is, what it was meant to be by God.

But my first question involves Christ's blood during the crucifixion. So I have heard various stories and I don't know the veracity of them, so I'm hoping to get comments on that as well as the effectiveness of this. But I've heard various stories of when Christ was crucified. Either one of two things One, it happened on top of Adam's grave. So then Christ's blood went down on to Adam's body. And the other one that I've heard is that the Ark of the Covenant was hidden under there. And so Christ's blood ended up on top of the lid or the mercy seat or whatever you want to call it. So my question is, is there any position on either of those two stories? And what is the significance of either of those things?"}

I've never heard the Ark thing before. The Adam's skull thing is represented in a lot of iconography, for sure.

But it doesn't make sense to me that it would be the Ark, if only because the Lord is crucified outside of the city, what would the Ark be doing out there, right?"}

Where it was supposedly housed for some period of time. And then there's all kinds of. Well, it's buried somewhere underneath it, or, well, it's, you know, got taken somewhere else or. Well, someone took it when the Knights Templar got done in, etc. Etc. But that's where that comes from. Also see the first Assassin's Creed game, but the. The first one, the part about Adam, is actually part of Christian tradition going all the way back into pre Christian Judaism. So in terms of sacred geography, Jerusalem was considered to be the place where paradise had been. So Mount Zion. Right, because it became the mountain of God. Right. It was being the mountain of God that then is the place where paradise is. And so it became the place where paradise always was. And so that then meant that the hill outside the city, right, where Did Adam die and get buried outside? Right. And that's why it was called the Hill of the Skull. That's where Golgotha comes from, was that was the site where Adam was buried. And that's why that's depicted, as Father Andrew mentioned in the icons of the Crucifixion. The skull. That's Adam's skull down beneath the cross that Christ's blood is running down toward. And if you go to the Church of the Holy Sepulcher and you go downstairs, it's down underneath. You have to wend your way down underneath. There is a chapel of Adam down there at Adam's tomb in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre."}

My second question involves the. I guess it's called Anno Mundi. But I. So one of the things that Father Stephen had said, if I remember correctly, was that he doesn't take an official position on, like, the age of the earth, because Church had not taken an official position on that. But then in the past month or so, I saw all this stuff on Facebook from different, like, Orthodox groups and entities and other things like that, talking about the liturgical New year and also, like, involving that, like, anno mundi saying it's like something 7,000 or 5,000 or something like that. So I was wondering if you could explain what that is. And, like, is that the Church having a position, the current age of the Earth, or what is that if it's not an official position?"}

I know some people don't understand what I mean when I say that young earth creationism is modernism. Right. But that's what I'm pointing at. Right. Because yes, the Church Fathers, people in the ancient Church, in, in the Roman Empire, the Christian Roman Empire, didn't believe the earth was millions of years old. Absolutely true, Absolutely true. But they also didn't attempt to determine that using pseudoscience or a fundamentalist reading of some addition to the Bible. That's not how they arrived at that."}

But what he's also forgetting is that I've got his number, which means, realistically, I have more like a 75% chance of winning.

And there's like a contrast made there between eventually here between the manna and the quail that God gives them. But like they're still.

And church fathers and other adjacent ancient Christian commentators talk about, like, the meat that they're satisfying themselves with. And it seems like, you know, the contrast also made with the manna, like the bread from heaven isn't. They're not satisfied with that and they eat something a little bit more lower, let's say. But what is historically going on there? Just seems like there's something else. I mean, could be. My main part of my question, I guess, is like they're literally livestock herders. They have all the meat and hamburgers that they want with them. What does it mean for them that they're lusting after meat when they. They're literally have herds of livestock with them? And so what is. What is going on there?"}

Right. One of the things that actually that made. Now, these are not Indo European peoples, but one of the things that made Indo European people much more capable of surviving on the steps of what is now Ukraine is that there was a little gene switch that flipped that made them able to metabolize milk in the years past infancy. And so they were then able to travel with their livestock a lot further because they could drink their milk and survive off of that. But you wouldn't necessarily want to slaughter them, you know, because once you kill an animal, it's gone. Right. So, yeah, I mean, they. They're probably using some of those animals to work. And for various reasons like that, they're not going to just be killing them and eating them because they're not living in a great area, you know, they're wandering in the desert. So that's, that's my, you know, off the cuff analysis. I don't know. Father Stephen. Yeah, give me some actuallys and corrections. And what do you think?"}

So the first thing has to do with meeting meat eating in general, which is something we've talked about on the show before, how there's this movement in Genesis for, from Adam and Eve eating fruit from trees, which doesn't even kill the plant."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #075 - 2023-09-14 - Pantheon and Pandemonium VIII - Live Q&A September 2023","start":3170.98,"end":3173.7,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Yeah. It's just the plant giving you something, right?"}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #075 - 2023-09-14 - Pantheon and Pandemonium VIII - Live Q&A September 2023","start":3173.7,"end":3465.09,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Like, yeah, the creation offers itself to Adam and Eve for food. Then after the expulsion from paradise, Adam has to work the ground by the sweat of his brow to bring forth food. Right. And that ends up, you're killing the plant, you're harvesting the plants, you're uprooting the plants and having to plant again and reseed and, and do all that work, but we're still just dealing with plants. And then it's only after the flood that humanity is, is given permission to eat meat. But that's also when the strict prohibition of eating blood comes in. Right? Because this isn't just license for man to become a predatory right, to become a predator. And so, and this is intimately related to the fasting rules of the Orthodox Church, then how that's understood and the monastic diet and all of that. But that diet now, right, as Americans especially now, we eat tons of meat all the time compared to anyone else in the history of the world. So it was, as Father Andrew said, fairly rare for people to have meat outside of sort of major feasts. So that's one piece. The other piece is running through Genesis this theme of the corruption of the city, right. Babylon being sort of the archetype Babel. Right. But you know, Abram and Lot divide the land and Lot wants to go live first near the city of Sodom and then next to the city of Sodom. And then all of a sudden he's in the city of Sodom and then he's sitting at the gates as one of the town leaders of Sodom. And so Egypt in Exodus represents the world empire. It is the Babylon of its day, right? It's this civilization that was the greatest superpower at the time. Exodus begins in the sight of the world, but the site of the greatest evil. And so if you read Exodus in the King James version, you'll see all these warnings about them craving the flesh pots of Egypt. And this is referring to the sort of lifestyle, right? This is why this ungodly pagan lifestyle of the cities has some appeal to people, right? There is this lifestyle. They're eating better, right? They're drinking better, they're enjoying this lifestyle that promises enjoyment in this world, right? And so that theme. And that's the place you have the flesh pots of Egypt, that's bringing them together, where you have the meat that's eaten, the meat that's served for food in Egypt, the luxurious food of Egypt. And so when they're craving meat, when they're dissatisfied with the bread from heaven and they're craving this meat, it's not just that it's meat in general. It's not like, oh, I need more protein, right? It's. This is specifically the flesh pots of Egypt that they're craving. It is the lifestyle, it is the relative plenty, the luxury of the city of man, right? Of the world that they're craving rather than being satisfied with what God is giving them from day to day. And God with the quail, for example, will on occasion stoop to our level, right? And that's a constant dynamic through the wilderness. Wanderings with Israel is despite Israel at any number of points sort of meriting their own destruction, right? And God starting over with somebody else. God condescends to them, right? Out of love. And so you get that dynamic of condescension with the quail, but this sort of demand and craving for this demand of God that God give them this kind of lifestyle is one of the crucial sins there. And this is not something that's foreign to our time."}

Right? So the. The gods any given person worshiped, and this is a family thing. Again, this is a communal thing, not an individual thing. Your. Your family had family gods. There might be some God that's a patron God of your family. There might be some famous ancestor of yours that's in the hero category, the sort of demigod category, whether they were actually an ancestor or not. You know, by our modern genealogy standards, the gods of the place where the family was originally from, the God or gods of the place to which the family had moved at some point. Right. And all of those are kind of conglomerated into the gods that were worshiped by a particular family or household extended family, and those would be represented materially through idols. That's what's being referred to in this case with the household Laban's household gods. And like I said, this continued all the way up to the Roman period. In. In the Roman household, that would be at a hearth. At the hearth, which was the center of the home and the center of Family life there would. That's where those idols would be. That would be the place where the family would gather for their familial worship offerings, that kind of thing. And so when Christianity comes. Right. Christianity obviously displaces that. Right. So St. Paul goes to Corinth, and you have pagan Romans, not Jewish people in Corinth, but pagans who join the Christian community. Right. Number one, no more idolatry. Right. So household gods have to go. Right. But what happens pretty much immediately is that it's not just like, okay, so now your family's not gonna gather for prayer or veneration or anything in your house anymore. No. Right. But you're going to gather instead to worship God in Christ. Right. And so you have those household gods getting displaced by iconography very quickly."}

I really enjoy the many discussions that the show has about the history and context of the ancient near east, the religious environment, and how the scriptures, the prophets, the apostles, engage with the world that they live in.

For example, I've taken Greek and Hebrew. I'm familiar with some of the extra biblical texts. You know, I've had a couple courses where we've looked at Mesopotamia, Eucharitic texts like the Baal Cycle and Emil Leash, etc. Shout out to Father Stephen, even the poem of the Righteous Sufferer, AKA Babylonian Job from a few episodes ago. But I feel like I fall short in going beyond that and often get stuck in contemporary, mostly modern, textual critical schools that want to reinterpret the ancient world through modern lenses. And so to put simply, how can one like myself or who's interested in understanding the world of the Bible study get a better context of the ancient Near East? How can a layman get a good starting place to do their own study and to be able to kind of engage with the stuff that's talked about on Board of Spirits, but they don't have the opportunity nor the incredible discipline for a formal PhD program, but would love to access whatever is generally available with like a computer or a library. So, long story short, how would a layman be able to do the work that y' all do regularly on a regular basis and get some amazing stuff out of it?"}

I. You know, the thing that I would suggest starting with is to read. To read the Old Testament Apocrypha as one of the best places to go. There's. I mean, that's a big bunch of text just right there. Like if you get the Charlesworth two volume set, that's two big books. So I mean, that is a good place to start for sure. I know. Another recommendation that we often give is especially if you're not, if you're not able or can't or just don't want to learn the ancient biblical languages. The Net Bible Full Notes edition is really great because even though the translation is kind of clunky at points, actually, let's just be honest, it's almost all clunky, that translation, but. But what it has is really detailed translation notes explaining why they translated the way they did and giving alternatives as well. And the cool thing about that is the whole, that whole text, including the notes, is on the Internet for free@netbible.org I think is what it is. So that's another good way to begin to take those deeper dives into some of that stuff and at least begin to see the larger world of what's going on there. But I mean, the biggest thing really is just, I don't know, frankly, go to Orthodox services a lot and really focus on what's being sung. Right. I'm not one of these people that says, oh, just go and the services will teach you everything. Because number one, that assumes that you can't even understand what's being said in terms of. Right. Like teaching knowledge that you can think about and talk about and discuss. So number one, it needs to be in a language you understand. But also a lot of parishes don't have a full, full cycle of services. So it's limited in that regard. But nonetheless there's still a huge amount there to give that sense of the way that the church interprets the Scriptures. So those are the three suggestions that I would give. And Father Stephen is now going to tell you where you can learn ugaritic at home."}

Right, interesting. So people will pick up a book about the Old Testament, you know, and it could be arguing for the documentary hypothesis. It could be arguing for some kind of crazy theory about Yahweh being part of a pantheon with Ellen Bale, you know, whatever. It could be the most liberal, weird 19th century German thing in the world. Right. You don't read secondary literature for the conclusions. Right. The conclusions they come to.

So cool to finally call in. Longtime listener. So it's cool to actually call in and ask. So I have a question about death by holiness. So something that this show has clearly established how it's a phenomena in the. In the scriptures, really illuminating the fact that this is a byproduct of the purifying nature of God. Right. So this really led me to start thinking about, you know, like, Christ's appearance on Mount Sinai. Moses can't look at God like the Father. Right. But he could talk to the angel of the Lord. So I really started thinking about the incarnation. You know, God walks the earth. Jesus dies with sinners. Nobody's bursting into flames. So, you know, in fact, sinners are healed. So, you know, it gets a little muddy. I start thinking about the Holy Spirit. So I guess my question is, you know, is death the step by holiness phenomena? Is this an exclusive quality of the Father? Are there, like, levels to this purifying quality? Yeah, I'd appreciate if you two could, like, rip on that in regards to the Trinity and how to understand it."}

So, you know, that's why, for instance, to eat and drink the body and blood of Christ in an unworthy manner is harmful to you, as St. Paul says. So I mean, that's a direct, that's a direct obvious reference right there to death by holiness from the Son of God, right? So, yeah, I don't know, Father. This is such a, such a great core concept of this podcast. And really, I think once you get the idea, you start to notice it everywhere in the Bible, right? And why do certain kind of things happen, like Ananias and Sapphira lying to the Holy Spirit? Boom."}

So in Leviticus, the tabernacle, right, God comes to dwell in the tabernacle. It's filled with his presence. And then what happens immediately after Nadab and Abihu, right, get, they're on fire for the Lord and they die by holiness. And then in the text of Leviticus, the Day of Atonement ritual is put into place because of what happened to Nadab and Abba to prevent that from happening again in a more widespread way in the camp. And then you have the same pattern in the Book of Acts where the Holy Spirit, right, the presence of God comes to dwell within, within the Christian community. And one of the first things that happens, Ananias and Sapphira, death by holiness, right? So the sort of stakes have not been lowered in the New Covenant in that regard. In the case of Christ's incarnation, this is what's going on, for example, when his flesh is referred to as the veil, talking about the veil of the temple, that Christ's humanity mediates his divinity to us in a certain, in a way that prevents that sort of death by holiness, that allows him to be seen by us and interacted with by us, right? It's not that. See, this is, this is one of the reasons why we talk about the humanity of the quote unquote, pre incarnate Christ on the show sometimes, even though that makes everyone's heads hurt. Because it's not that, oh well, you can't see the Father, but you can see the Logos, because the Logos is like less God or something, right? That would be Arianism, right? Christ is not the mediator between God and man in that sense, right? That he is some being that is in between God and man. Christ is a mediator between God and man in his own person."}

Our shared human nature. And it is our shared human nature that then allows for that mediation to humanity. So that's what prevents people from dying when they look at Christ, Right. Or when they stand in his presence or even are sinful in his presence. Right. The other thing right, is that, of course, there is a voluntary nature to all of this, right? So, yeah, Nadab and Abihu did something egregious and died by holiness, but every other high priest who ever went back there was also a sinner."}

That Zechariah is St. John the Forerunner's father, right. Who he's talking about who was murdered recently, right. Between the altar and the high place. Right? But so for people who don't accept that, the problem with identifying who that Zechariah is is there are multiple priests named Zechariah between or in the intertestamental period who were murdered in the temple."}

You know, it's not that Christ couldn't have struck dead all of the Roman soldiers and Jerusalem mites who were crucifying him if he wanted to. Right? They could have all died due to their wickedness in his presence. Right. But there's a voluntary aspect to it as well, Right.

I was calling because you guys have talked a lot in past episodes about understanding how things are made holy by being set apart or things that are set apart and are used for holy purposes. And that makes a lot of sense, especially when looking at places and objects. But I'm wondering about, especially how practically do you do that with time, especially looking at, like, keeping the Sabbath holy, being able to honor, especially on a feast day, being able to keep feast days holy. And I mean, without getting super legalistic of like, okay, well, we're gonna, you know, just, we have to go to church and there's no video games and you can't do this and you can't do that. And like, I don't, like, what's the actual, like, manner in which we can approach keeping our time holy and set apart in a certain way, especially in big families, because I have six kids, so keeping time holy is a challenge anytime. So."}

I'm two thirds of the way, you know, where you are. Six is magnificent. Yeah, Right. So, well, let me pass on a little bit of wisdom from my wife. She has a lot of it, actually. So she has, you know, especially since her husband is a priest, when it's time to be in church in particular, that means she's managing the kids largely on her own, thank God. Now, the older ones help with the younger, although not always, as I'm sure you know, as a mother of six. Yes, yes, right. But. But she. I hate to speak for her here, but I think this is such a beautiful thing that I've heard her say, especially to younger mothers. She refers to dealing with that as praying with your feet. And apparently there was for a while. I don't know if it still exists, but there was an unorthodox mother's blog out there somewhere. I think she was also a priest's wife titled Praying with My Feet or something like that. And it just refers to just the simple act of having to go in and out of church over and over and over and over again, which I'm sure you've experienced."}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #075 - 2023-09-14 - Pantheon and Pandemonium VIII - Live Q&A September 2023","start":6175.78,"end":6590.66,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Oh, yes. Right, right. So, you know, a lot of times when people want to, like, okay, you arrive at church on Sunday mornings like, this is holy time. It's set apart, it's holy. How do you do that? You go in, you focus, you be in church, you listen to the prayers, you sing along, you make the sign of the cross, you receive the sacraments. And then a kid starts screeching, right? Maybe it's your child, maybe it's someone else's child, but it's an opportunity for repentance, but it feels like distraction. Right? And so, you know, the task of parents and of helpful godparents and aunts and uncles and older brothers and sisters is to help train those younger ones to learn how to keep the time holy themselves. And that is an ascetical act. You have to sacrifice your own sense of momentary peace in church in order to train someone else how to be there and be ready to receive what we all showed up to receive. Right. It's not easy by any means. In a lot of ways, the clergy, we do have our challenges, but in that regard, it's pretty easy for us, relatively speaking. We're generally surrounded by people who are trying to be pretty focused and are doing it fairly well. Although clergy can get distracted, too, for sure. But, yeah, if you don't catch everything that's sung or, you know, you only hear 10% of the sermon, if that. Right. I mean, my wife has missed many of my sermons, and, you know, God bless her, she doesn't need to hear my sermons. She lives with me, so she has to hear me blow V8 all the time. If you never hear those things right, you are still doing something that is extremely hard, holy, Extremely holy. Right. To me, the moment that we stand before God, if we can speak about it in this way, there's two recommendations I would like to receive at the throne of God. One is from my wife. I hope that she can say, yeah, you can let him be here. And the other will be for my children. And if they can do that, then by God's grace, I will have been saved. And so those of us who live in families, this is our biggest task, is to assist and to participate in the salvation of the people that we live with, because, not only because it helps them, but because, although that would be enough, but also because it helps us. And I remember there was one time, I don't remember if I've said this on this show before, but there was one time I was in confession with my father confessor, and I was describing him, my struggles, trying to live a good life. And I said something to the effect of, you know, but the people around me make it really hard. You know, I could be a better Christian kind of, if it weren't for them. You know, that's basically what I said to him. I don't remember the exact words, but that was the message. And he said. He said, you know, all the things you've described to me, all the struggles that you have, right? The. The way that your. Your family acts, the struggles that they have, the failings that they have, the strengths they have. He says, you have asked God for salvation, right? I said, yes. He said, this is what he's given you because he knows that this is what you need for your salvation. And if you wish there were some other way, then what you're trying to do is walk a different path on the one he actually gave you, because this is what you need to be saved. This life that you have said, you know, they're not in the way. They are the way they are the way, Right? And, yeah, I mean, I know full well that when you're feeling exasperated at children or at anybody, it feels like it's impossible to pray. But, I mean, we have multiple, multiple saints who have said things to the effect of, you know, one person who offers a single prayer in the midst of the world actually is doing a greater work than monks who live in monasteries and get to pray in peace all day long, which is an amazing thing to say for. And most of these sayings come from monks, you know, so. So they recognize that. That the struggle, the challenge and the salvific value of the difficulties that we have just trying to do the basic acts of prayer and piety and just trying to keep some order, that. That is a very, very powerful, powerful thing. I know this turned in kind of a monologue now, but I do have some experience with this, and I mostly have experience watching my wife, who has really, really has worked very, very hard at this and seeing it pay off. I mean, my children range from ages 6 to 16. So, you know, and I'm not going to say that any of them are always 100% totally ready to be in prayer or whatever, but as I've watched them begin to love it and connect and so forth, I can see that this is the work that my wife has done, right. And that I've tried to contribute to, but especially that she's done. So I know that's what I would say about that, especially about trying to participate in church life with six children. It's a glorious thing that you're doing. It really is. It's a holy, holy thing that you're doing. And you don't know how many lives you are going to benefit by not just the six small people that you're dealing with, but also the people who watch you dealing with them. The people who watch you even maybe get frustrated and then come back and keep doing it, because that's really important. But then also the many lives that those children will affect as well, that they will pass on. I mean, so it's. It's. It's a grand, grand work. And so it's going to feel like a great quest because. Because it is. So that's what I would have to say to that. Okay, so now my long monologue is over. Father Stephen, I'm going to hand the ball over to you."}

We do that ritually. And those rituals don't have to be sacred as opposed to secular. They need to be sacred as opposed to profane. So for example, when I was a kid, I wore different clothes on Sunday than I wore every other day of the week on Sundays. When I was really little and my grandfather was still alive, we went over to grandma and grandpa's house for Sunday dinner every week. We didn't do that any other day. We later on, when I got older and my grandfather passed away, it was. Grandma would come over to our house. But when she came over to our house for Sunday dinner, we all sat at the dining room table, not the kitchen table where we usually ate. Right. It was different. None of those things are particularly sacred or holy or quote, unquote, religious in the modern sense of sacred secular distinction. But all of those things were actions by which Sunday became a different day for me than the other days of the week. A few years ago, I tried to have a conversation with somebody who is an atheist."}

Long time, first time, very thankful for Lord of spirits, my wife and I have become. I've begun attending Orthodox church, thanks in large part to your work. And we're reading Religion of the Apostles. But I'm trying to understand the view of sacrifice and idolatry you're putting forward. That's young. There are a few things I'm struggling to fit together. You frame sacrificial. Well, he frames sacrificial worship as a form of hospitality towards God when done correctly or towards other spirits when done wrongly. And if I recall correctly, he refers to the spirits that God put over the 70 nations as falling by accepting the sacrificial worship. But if it's just hospitality, why is it wrong for the nations to offer this form of service and wrong for the spirits to accept it? And if I can just throw in a follow up, I notice the hospitable offering of animals and other sacrifices and is often paired with offering incense, like in Kings, where it talks about them offering incense to baal. So then why does the seventh council say the images of like, you know, saints and angels can be offered incense? I'm just a little confused how this all fits together. Thank you for."}

Well, number one, it's not just hospitality as a general category other than because otherwise that would mean, you know, having your, your best bet over for dinner would be idolatry. Right. So it's, it's. That's not all that it is. It's hospitality as to a God which has a particular ritual form. Okay. Yeah. It's not just hospitality in general. So what does that ritual form look like? Well, in idolatry, they set up an idol, they put food in front of it, it gets offered ritually to the God and then either burnt completely for the God or maybe part offer the God and part eaten yourself. And the whole idea is to kind of control the God and get what you want from it. Right. That's what's going on in idolatry. And when you invite that God into your community in that way, then you become like that God. Right. So it's a kind of intimacy, spiritual intimacy, that is only appropriate for Yahweh, the God of Israel. You know, if you offer that to an angel, an obedient angel says no. We see that happen in scripture. Right. They do not accept sacrifices. You offer that to Paul and Silas, they say, no, we're not going to take that. Right. That's what happens in Lystra. So it's really about this set of actions, and this ritual way is appropriate only to God. With regards to incense, it is within that context of hospitality and sacrifice. But what's happening with incense and icons or even, you know, other humans. Right. Because other people standing in church get sensed when the deacon or the priest comes down and senses them. Right. It's not being offered to them. It's been offered to God. Right. The prayer actually says, that incense we offer to thee, O Christ our God. Right. It's been offered to God. So the sacrifice is to God, but then it is used to purify and to make sacred the space and the people. Right. So it's an act of purification. So incense, I mean, incense, the ancient world had. Had this notion. It also. It has the sense of hospitality, not just because it smells nice, but because there's a sense of. It cleanses the air. And there was this understanding that it. That it wards off evil spirits. Right. So it has this pure. The spiritual purification element. And I think I remember reading recently someone actually. Not that this super matters for this regard, but it's interesting to note that apparently incense also even has a kind of purifying effect on the air with regards to things like diseases that are airborne, that it actually helps to ward off that possibility too, which I'm sure ancient people must have. Must have noticed maybe that as an effect. So I don't know, Father, am I leaving something out or getting something wrong or."}

Right. Because the place to go ON this is First Corinthians 10. And what St. Paul says about sacrifices, including the Eucharist. Right. What does he say? He says what the nations sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons and not to God. And he says, I do not want you to be. And the word there is Kenania, which is usually translated as participation or partakers, but that's the word we sometimes translate in modern English is fellowship. Right. I do not want you to have this hospitality, this fellowship, this participation with demons, right? And he says you can't participate with Christ and with the demons, right? So that is. That is the issue there, that, that this hospitality is not just like, oh, we had, you know, the new neighbors over for. For, you know, tuna casserole, right? It's. This is, you know, creating this relationship of community fellowship that we're talking about, and doing that with a demon, with an unclean spirit, an evil spirit, obviously, is like a horrible idea, right? And is going to lead to destruction, whereas doing that with God is going to lead in a fundamentally different direction, right? So this isn't just hospitality in the sense of doing something nice for somebody. This is like community building. The, these communal meals and the sacrificial rituals that surrounded them are what created communities. That's what made an Athenian an Athenian was participating in that sacrificial ritual life. This is why there's such a crisis when St. Paul starts going to these Greek cities. And that's why some people start suggesting, hey, why don't they just all become Jews? That'll solve the problem, right? But St. Paul says, no, they need to stay Greek. And being Greek needs to mean something different than it used to. And that's a long process that takes centuries, right? But ultimately, the Greek identity today, part of it is being an Orthodox Christian. Hey, it worked, right? And so that's fundamentally different than what it meant to be an Athenian in the first century, which meant worshiping Athena and participating in certain pagan vessels. So this is. This is fellowship, this is hospitality, is community building, the building of family bonds among. Among people that you don't want to do with demons, you want to do with God, because we're part of the household of God. In terms of incense, what Father Andrew said is, is right in the sense that we literally, at the altar, offer the incense to Christ and then the smoke is distributed. So, and this is true not just. This isn't just a biblical principle. This is true in the Torah. This is also true in every other ancient culture, because every other ancient culture offered incense. I know it sounds crazy. We've said this on the show before. I know it sounds crazy to your average random modern person to say that the default way of worship among the human species is the offering of incense and sacrifices. But I offer to you, the history of the world is proof, right? Literally every culture on earth, everywhere, but that, that smoke with incense is the product of the sacrifice. And blood was seen in largely the same way the blood of an animal sacrifice that is right. Or with a drink offering, the wine. Right, but. And what does the blood of an animal sacrifice do? It has this purificatory effect because by virtue of that animal being designated as the sacrificial animal and used as sacrifice, the blood is moved into the realm of the sacred and therefore has this purificatory effect. The same thing is true of the smoke of incense. And so in the same way that, for example, on the day of atonement in the Torah, the blood of the goat that's offered to Yahweh as a sin offering is then distributed in a certain way to purify the accoutrement of the holy of holies, of the holy place. The smoke is just. Of the incense is distributed to purify all those present, including those represented there by icons, including the humans there present, who are, after all, the icon of God, the image of God."}

I can't tell you what an honor it is to have a small part in this, your very final show. It was a really good run, guys. I love the bat stuff. You know, I just wanted to quickly apologize again for not reviewing with you our AFR audience standards way back in 2020. Now, that would have saved us both a lot of headaches, am I right? Yeah. As you were reminded, we have that pesky little AFM wide cap on the number of nerds with whom we're associated and which you guys blew right on past by episode two, didn't you? And it didn't seem like the geeks were Ever going to stop tuning in, I tell you what. Anywho, even though Melinda had to cancel the program, and if I can be honest here, she never really liked it anyway. Too much giggling, she says, I just wanted you to know, as you put Lord of Spirits to bed for the very last time, that it was such a joy to spend six and a half hours with you every other week.

So my question today is I feel like there's this idea that, you know, which, you know, is this idea of that the original sort of intent. And I know this is summarizing a lot, but the idea of taking the Garden of Eden, paradise, you know, this sort of, like, divine order that God originally created the world with and expanding it outward. And I feel like this brings, at least for some people and sometimes for, well, this sort of, like, image of this very, like, bucolic image of gardening as being something kind of meditative and peaceful. And I know from experience there's actually a lot of suffering and Frustration involved. So I was wondering how sort of this idea of, I guess you could say divine gardening and divine order contrasts with, you know, the consequences. And after the fall, in terms of Adam and Eve being told that they have to toil for, you know, their food and that the ground essentially, you know, they have to work the ground for their food. I know we're not supposed to be taking that literally, but, you know, how do, how do those ideas sort of, what does that heavenly gardening look like, if that makes sense."}

I mean, I think ultimately it looks like if, you know, if you read all the way through the Scriptures, right, ultimately it looks like the new Jerusalem. Right. So, I mean, we do tend to think of, of, of paradise as being this, you know, like, like those flower gardens that, you know, we, you can go to old mansions sometimes, they have lots of big flower gardens, that kind of thing. But, you know, it's, it's depicted. So paradise is a walled garden, right? So there is not just, it's not just this kind of untrammeled wilderness. It's cultivated. It's cultivated and it has human participation intended and designed for that. Right? So it's, it ultimately is about civilization, but it's civilization as given by and in concert with God rather than the civilization that Cain created, creates, which is opposite all of that. Right? So, you know, when, when Adam and Eve, it becomes hard for them, it's an indication that they're still supposed to be working on what they were given, but now it's going to be hard because of their mortality, because of their sin, right? It's going to, it's going to take work, it's going to take repentance is what it, what it ultimately means. And the beautiful thing is that even when someone gets to the point where sin has been cleaned out, that doesn't mean like, okay, bam, now we have paradise. It doesn't mean that actually. It means like, okay, now we can begin in some sense, now we can return to this task, but it will be actually greater than even what Adam and Eve had ultimately, because Christ has come, and through Christ is the, all of this as a possibility, right? So I don't know, Father, more to say about that, less to say, correct?"}

It's just now very difficult. Now it's a struggle, right, to do it. And this isn't just the fault of our first Parents, this is the fault of us. But in part, you know, we've got this Puritan, Calvinist thing in the back of our heads, at least as Americans, where when people hear what I'm about to say, which is turning the world into a garden is essentially humanizing it, they look at that with horror, right? Because we're all kind of convinced at the back of our heads that humans are totally depraved. And therefore, to humanize something would be like to pave paradise and put in a parking lot or, you know, turn everything into a giant city or corrupt everything or cause mass extinctions, right? Because nature is good and beautiful until humans show up."}

That's a problem with our anthropology, right? Because the place where we look to see what a human truly is is not Adam and not me, but Christ. Christ doesn't just show us who God is. He shows us what a human looks like, an actual human, what we're trying to aspire to be and grow into. And so turning the world into a tended garden is humanizing it because it's about re establishing the relationship between us as humans and the rest of the creation that was damaged at the expulsion from paradise and shattered by Cain. And we see this, we see the image of this in the saints, for example, with their relationships with animals, sometimes wild animals, right, who they were at peace with, they were able to live. Live at peace with, right? Why? Because. Because of their way of being in the world and because of them becoming human in Christ, the relationship between them and the rest of creation was sort of re established. So that's part of what we're shooting for. And that's not something. That's not a switch we can flip, right? And it's not something I can give you. Here's the. The 10 steps to turning your world into a garden. I'd sell more books that way. Probably people like that kind of thing here in America. But. But it's. It's. So as we work toward being conformed to the likeness of Christ, becoming more like Christ and therefore, and thereby becoming more like God, the relationship between us and other people is re established. And the relationship between us as people and the rest of the creation is re established in a way that gives order to it and gives it renewed life rather than the opposite."}

And it seems like, you know, in. In our normal phenomenological existence, you know, we do experience Santa Claus as existing, but more so as a body. I think trying to just understand what the Orthodox Church teaches on this and what has been talked about on the show before. I don't know. What do you think about that?"}

I think I got what you're talking about. So, I mean, without. I can't say I completely understand all of the ins and outs of Peugeot's arguments about this, although I've watched the Santa Claus video. We've talked about this before. So the question might be, like, is St. Nicholas. Right, the saint. Is he making use of all of these cultural elements to do something like, is he using them as a body? Right. I think that that would be a hard sell for me because, you know, Mall Santa is not necessarily conveying Christ to you. Right. Which St. Nicholas is always concerned about doing that because he's a saint, because he belongs. He's a bishop of the church. You know, he's a saint. He loves Christ, he worships Christ. Right. So is there something else that's making use of all that? And I know one of the big questions is sort of, does consciousness arise out of kind of a mass of movements of people? Like, is there a spirit that arises out of it? I. That suggests that human beings can get together and create spirits like that? We can create beings. I don't think that's true. Now, can a spirit influence a whole people all at once? Absolutely, of course. I mean, we've said that many, many times, you know, so, yeah, I think There's a difference between a spirit animating a people and Although, I mean, it's not a huge, huge difference necessarily, but. And, and like having a body. Yeah. I don't know. What do you think, Father? We're kind of getting in some good metaphysical weeds here, so."}

In fact, the last time we talked about it, I explicitly said that I'm not entirely sure. And the last time I saw him address this, in fact, if I remember correctly, someone directly asked him about, like, what, what I said the last time this came up on the show."}

Right. And in that context, Peugeot kind of said that he didn't think you should try to nail it down too much. Meaning he deliberately is not defining this really tightly. Right. So I'm not going to claim I can define his view more tightly than he thinks it should be defined, but I can't lay out what I'm saying I can try and lay out. So what I'm saying is Santa Claus exists as an idea. St Nicholas exists. He is a person. He is a human person, Right. And those are two distinct things metaphysically. So he as a person has a body in the sense that we talk about bodies on this show. A nexus of power and potentialities, Right. He has agency. He is able to act as an idea. Santa Claus is an idea. Idea. An idea does not have a body and does not have agency or the ability to act. But a, an idea is something that can be utilized, Right? It is an instrument. So St. Nicholas can use the Santa Claus idea instrumentally to do things, but other beings and people with agency can also. Right? So a, a good hearted human can use the idea of Santa Claus to dress up and go and visit a children's cancer ward, right. To do good to those kids. Another person can use that idea and dress up as Santa and use it to go rob houses, which is totally a thing, Right? Like, and so at Coca Cola can go and instrumentalize those ideas to sell you high fructose corn syrup and caramel coloring, Right? So an idea can be instrumentalized in, in all of these different ways, but it's not itself has agents have agency because it's not a person. Whereas St Nicholas is a person and so is a person who can instrumentalize those ideas."}

I could go around asking people for money, trying to trade on my E Micro celebrity to accumulate some small sum of money. Right. But other people can use it, too. Right? So someone could go on Twitter and say, well, Father Stephen DeYoung said, and what are they doing when they do that? They're using the idea of me to make some point, to win some argument. Right. To get people mad at me. And on their side, whatever they're trying to use it for. Right. They're instrumentalizing that idea. Right. So that's another example. Right. Of that. Right.
