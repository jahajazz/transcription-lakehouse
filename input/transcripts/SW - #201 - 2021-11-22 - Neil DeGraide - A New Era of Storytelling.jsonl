You have to. Like you said, I think the way you talked about it, where you have an image and then you poke at the image and you turn around it and you, you kind of nurture this intuition is a much better way to do it. And then once you, once you have something out there, then you can combat with clippers and just kind of prune it a little bit or readjust things slightly so that they're more, they're, they're, they're more coherent in terms of the structure.

Not like computer programmers and not scientists. Like in terms of changes in the sense of what happens in the world. Like you can make a technology, but the dream of the world comes from the prophets and the artists. And even in the scientific revolution, you can see that Cyrano de Bergerac's voyage to the Moon precedes any scientific desire to go to the moon. The storytellers were the ones that the, the, all the imagery that happened in the 17th century, a lot of it was storytelling. It wasn't. And so we need to.
