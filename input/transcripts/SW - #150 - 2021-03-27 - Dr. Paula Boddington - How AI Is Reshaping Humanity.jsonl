I would like to introduce you to Dr. Paula Boddington. Dr. Boddington is a moral philosopher. She teaches at several schools and she's also a published author on questions of morality and several issues as well. She dabbles in all kinds of subjects. I've seen her on television in the uk. She discusses the problems of AI, which is why I have her on our show today to. To talk about the narratives around AI, the ethics of AI, because I know it's something that interests you, the people that watch this channel quite a bit. This is Jonathan Pageau. Welcome to the symbolic world. So, Dr. Paula, maybe you can start by introducing yourself, because I do what I can. To introduce yourself and tell us a little bit how you got interested and how you moved into the field of AI and morality."}

So when I started working on issues about AI and ethics about five or six years ago, just by one of those chances, because I was working at one of the colleges in Oxford and there were a couple of people there who were really interested in this. So we applied and round about the time what was happening was it was around about 2014, 2015, there was a lot of attention to the problems of there might be forthcoming disasters in relation to AI. So people like Stephen Hawking and Elon Musk were speaking out, claiming that. Well, really worried about concerns about what might happen when we develop AI in the future. And then what happened was that there's an organization called the Future of Life Institute, which is based in Boston. And Elon Musk donated a whole lot of money for research projects looking at beneficial AI. So three of us, we put in a proposal and were lucky enough to get one of their grants. So I was working on that for a couple of years. But the topic we were looking at was developing codes of ethics for AI. So I worked on that, which is. It kind of. It's really interesting. There's. Now, there are so many codes of different codes of ethics for AI all over the world. There's actually a website that collates and tracks them all. But what I was really interested in was not so much developing a code of ethics because, well, what I'm really interested in is looking at the issues behind that, looking at how you might even start to think about what the ethical issues are, and then talking about codes of ethics. There's two layers to it because you don't have just to think about what the ethical issues are. You have to think about how you're actually going to bring this about in practice. How you're actually going to bring about good practice because there are so many examples of organizations that have got fantastic codes of ethics and it makes no difference whatsoever. One of my favorite examples is Enron who Enron, younger people might not remember, collapsed disastrously, taking the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of people. Had fantastic code of ethics. There's also a really fantastic code of medical ethics, giving dignity to the patient and informed consent. That was around in Germany before the Second World War, so that was before the Nazis, so that's always really, really, really important to remember kind of thing. So that's how I got to work into in the ethics of AI. But prior to that I'd done quite a lot of other work in philosophy in relation with. I've previously looked, looked at work with teams of genomic scientists looking at ethical issues in genomics research and before that in clinical genetics. And before that I've done a lot of work in relation to how we think about what a person is. So I've done some work in relation with a psychologist in relation to how people with learning disabilities are regarded. And I also do. So what I've also been doing because I've done lots of different bits of work, so this is a really long introduction. So one of the things I've been doing as well for the last few years at the same time as doing work in relation to the ethics of AI, it's. I've been working with a team of sociologists who do ethnographic work looking at the care of people with dementia in hospital wards, which is like, really, it's such good luck to be looking, doing, working with those two different things at the same time because they seem like they're worlds apart. But it's really, really valuable because of a contrast, because of how people with dementia are so marginalized and. And also it's related, of course, to ideas of a loss of cognitive capacity. On the other hand, you've got people working in AI who feel that intelligence and cognitive capacity is the pinnacle of human endeavor, but we should try to surpass as. I'm sorry, it's a really, really long introduction."}

Or not of the problem, one of the realities of AI is that there's a personification of AI. It just happens naturally in terms of how we treat it, how we approach it. And it's a long story with robots and Isaac Asimov and it's a very Old story. It's not something that just right away happens. But we have this tendency to personify AI, and like you said, there is a tendency to de. Personify people who have cognitive breakdown because we have associated personhood with cognitive ability or with. With mental ability."}
{"episode_id":"SW - #150 - 2021-03-27 - Dr. Paula Boddington - How AI Is Reshaping Humanity","start":336.56,"end":426.92,"speaker":"Dr. Paula Boddington","text":"Yeah, yeah, precisely. Those are the issues I'm really, really interested in. And when we think about AI, there are different kind of narratives that are told, not always consistent with each other, but different narratives in different areas of AI about AI, but they always go along with an assumed or explicit or often implicit narrative about humans, because humans and AI are seen in relation to each other. So that we use AI, or the AI is being developed and in order to sometimes replace humans. So when you have to ask the question of why would you want to replace a human? Sometimes for good reasons, actually. So, for example, I mean, one really good reason would be if you wanted to clear a land field of landmines, so much better to use a robot. So some of it's good, but. So you either want to replace humans or you want to try to enhance humans. But if you want to enhance humans, if you want to enhance something, you have to have an idea about what would make it better. So you have to have an idea, because not all, you know, not all changes are enhancements, are they? So you have to have some idea about what it is that humans are lacking. So it always goes along with some idea about how humans stand in relation to the rest of the world and some idea about what faults humans might have or what imperfections they might have that we can surpass. But it does really, really tend to reinforce. There's been work in moral philosophy for quite a long time about notions of personhood, which I think are. My personal view is that they are too biased towards the cognitive. But the work in AI only just reinforces that."}
{"episode_id":"SW - #150 - 2021-03-27 - Dr. Paula Boddington - How AI Is Reshaping Humanity","start":427.8,"end":491.69,"speaker":"Jonathan Pageau","text":"Well, there's something about what you're saying in the idea of this image of the golem or this image of the artificial being that we saw kind of popped up very strongly in the time of the Romantics and Frankenstein. And all of this kind of narrative is very important to understand. This mirror, it really does end up acting like a mirror. And so we end up projecting our politics, our morality. And like you said, the most dangerous part of it is that it's often implicit. We don't actually know. So, like you said, like, when Elon Musk says he wants to make human beings better by implanting a chip in their brain, no one ever asks what you're talking about, like, what Is this better? And it usually just means more powerful in terms of adding capacity. That seems to be what we're talking about. But adding capacity, what is it? The Spider Man. Famous Spider man quote, with great power. And so adding capacity is not always something you want to do."}
{"episode_id":"SW - #150 - 2021-03-27 - Dr. Paula Boddington - How AI Is Reshaping Humanity","start":491.77,"end":593.45,"speaker":"Dr. Paula Boddington","text":"Yes, yes. Yeah. Yes. It's interesting. So one of the things I was just looking up this week, thinking about talking to you, is that very often you talk about AI. If you Google it, you'll find lots of people talking about AI dethroning humans. But it's really, really quite interesting as to the context in which that's used the idea that we'd be knocked off our throne. And actually, it's also really interesting because a lot of people are kind of like, welcoming that, because a lot of people are really against. So a lot of people say, for example, have a really simplistic notion of a religious view of humanity, but wear the crown of creation. And. But Darwin has come along and knocked us off our pedals, and that's a really good thing because we shouldn't lord it over the rest of the rest of. But if you look at the context in which they talk about dethroning, AIs, dethroning humans, it seems a lot. It's often in context of something like when AlphaGo beat Lee Sedol, the world GO champion, or at something like chess or something where there's some beating the humans at some intellectual task, or often where it's really, really easy to work out. It's really easy to work out whether somebody's better at go, because there are criteria for whether you've won or not. Completely certain. But also, it's made me think about the sorts of things that we're worried about being dethroned, because as far as I know, Arnold Schwarzenegger is not crying his eyes out because a forklift truck can lift heavier things than he can. And, you know, Usain Bolt isn't worried that cheetahs can run faster than him. So it really is. Something about. It really does tell a lot about why we think that, like, being clever at certain things are kind of dethroning us. We're not at all worried that chimpanzees could. A chimpanzee could rip you from limb to limb because they're so much stronger than us. We don't care."}

{"episode_id":"SW - #150 - 2021-03-27 - Dr. Paula Boddington - How AI Is Reshaping Humanity","start":606.17,"end":726.71,"speaker":"Jonathan Pageau","text":"The idea. I think that the idea that you're talking about is because the west has really taken up the underdog story as being the story, right? We've taken up the revolutionary story as being the story itself. And so all our movies, all our stories since the Enlightenment have been revolutionary. And so because of that, then there's this surprising thing, like you said, which appears in stories, which appears in something like the desire to have AI dethrone us, or the desire for extraterrestrials to come and show us up, or just even the cuckolding narrative, which has become strangely popular. All of this is this strange manifestation of this revolutionary tendency which turns against you. It's almost like you're revolutionary, but then you expect, almost like implicitly, that something from underneath is going to come and take your place. And you see that in. It's an old story. It's the story of the Greek gods, how they castrated their father. And then, you know, that's what it is. So one of the things that I've been saying on my channel, and I've said it kind of here and there, but I want to say clearly here, I guess, because I have some friends that are in computer science and very smart people, you know who I'm talking about here, the people who are watching this, and they tell me that it's technically impossible, right? General intelligence in computers is technically impossible. And it's funny because I don't have no way of knowing that because I'm not a computer scientist. What I do know is that it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter whether it's technically possible or not. What truly matters mostly matters is what story we tell. If everybody believes that this is happening, then that will have way more an effect, way more of an effect than if it actually happens. And you can't know something's conscious anyways. How can you know that? I can't know that of you. I can't know that of completely know it. Like, I can't know it internally the way I know my own consciousness. I don't know how you would even evaluate that."}
{"episode_id":"SW - #150 - 2021-03-27 - Dr. Paula Boddington - How AI Is Reshaping Humanity","start":726.95,"end":816.55,"speaker":"Dr. Paula Boddington","text":"No. I always wondered about people talking about AI becoming conscious because you don't know if another person is conscious. I remember when I was a philosophy undergraduate and we had to write an essay about the problem of other minds. And I spent a whole week really, really, really worried because when you think about it, you don't know that anybody else is conscious. So actually, that's one of the things that's really interesting about how we project these things onto AI because a lot of people are Talking about, oh, if AI or robots become conscious, then they've got rights. We should treat them in the same ways we should treat humans. But it's really interesting because even if they were conscious, how would you tell they were conscious? But also how would you know what their consciousness was like? Because we look lots of. I mean, loads and loads of animals we assume are conscious, but we don't think they have the same rights as human beings. We don't think that a dog's got a right to vote because he's conscious. So it's really interesting how quickly we assume, but how quickly so many people assume. But also it's. I mean, actually it's a really human tendency. It's a really human tendency to extrapolate humanity onto things. Like you see faces of things all the time. And there's a tendency to sort of extrapolate humanity onto robots really quickly or worry about. So I remember Joanna Bryson who works in robotics and she also works now a lot in ethics, she said she noticed that when she was working with robots, people would really worry about whether it was like cruel to unplug the robot. So, yeah, it's really interesting project onto it. But also, I think there's another reason for. So we could."}
{"episode_id":"SW - #150 - 2021-03-27 - Dr. Paula Boddington - How AI Is Reshaping Humanity","start":817.43,"end":885.27,"speaker":"Jonathan Pageau","text":"Sorry, it's really. It's super. It's not just a little interesting. It's very interesting because what's mostly interesting about that to me is the notion of the, the making of a body. Right. And so the idea that. The idea that you can make a body to host intelligence is something which has existed forever. That's what idols are. Idols have always been, you know, statues of gods have always been the creation of bodies that would host intelligences and that intelligence would manifest itself through proxy, like in a proxy through proxy through. It's the believer, let's say, are the people sacrificing to that God through this image. And so it seems to me that we're seeing something similar happen now is that, let's say the intelligence of artificial intelligence is through us, like we are the proxies of the artificial intelligence. It needs us in order to be intelligent. But that doesn't mean that it doesn't act the way that an ancient God would also act, because we trust it like the way that the ancients trusted the gods. We trust Google, we trust Facebook, we trust these algorithms."}

But also it's Worse than that, because we've painted ourselves into a corner, because we have to trust it, because everything is set up. Everything is set up in order to have to. You have to use it. And even if you aren't, you're walking down the street and it's being used. So we've painted ourselves into a corner there. So, yeah, so say you, because there's also a lot of distrust as well. But it actually gets back to the question about you say computer scientists say you'll never have artificial general intelligence. I mean, who knows? Because others argue that you can, but it's always, in a sense, you always have to oversimplify to explain points. But you can divide concerns in ethics of AI broadly into people who are looking at the future. So the possibility of super intelligence, something which might be in the future, sometime, maybe 25 years in the future or whenever. There's lots of debates about how long it's going to be if that happens. So some people are worried about super intelligence and then they're worried about whether. So that's in two branches. So some people really look forward to that and think that is really great and our descendants will actually be digital or humans will become digital. So that's one lot actually think that, and another lot are really worried about this and we need to prepare. So one argument is that maybe it won't happen, but we need to be ready just in case it does. Trying to make AI sort of beneficial for humans and really worried about AI is going to take control. So there's a worry that in the future it'll take control. And then there are people who are concerned about what's happening now with the AI we have now and all the other computing, which is maybe not quite AI, but I think that's a false dichotomy because it's already taken control. It's already taken control."}

And I think to me, the best way to see it is still in the analogy of the ancient God or the ancient temple, is that it's taken control through a priestly caste, which is what would have happened in all the temples before is that the will of the God manifests itself through the priestly caste, which informed the people and tell them to look to the God. Right. The caste is saying, look to the statue, and then they are explaining the will. And it's like, I'm not even saying that as if it's bad, it's actually how reality works. But you need to know who your priestly cast is. And I think that that's one of the things that at least in certain spheres is worrying people the most is that these tech elites are not definitely not a superior cast. Like, they're definitely not the people you want to entrust your civilization to."}

So yeah, I think it's really important to remember that because when people talk about AI being in charge, we also have to remember that there's people. It's actually people doing it. It's big corporations and. And they're half in charge and half not in charge. That's the problem. They don't really know what they're doing. It's like you've got a priestly chart cast of half wits, really. It's like you."}

It seems like there are some mechanisms which are set at hand. And so like, one of the things you said at the outset, which really intrigued me is the idea that the problem of the ethics of, like the problem of the ethics of AI isn't just about deciding what the code of AI is. It's that there are certain patterns which are there which will lay themselves out. And so you can say whatever you want. It's almost as if you said, like, I'm going to create an ethics of weapon making. And my ethics of weapon making is that you can't use these weapons to kill people. Okay, dude, it's like, that's really nice. But though you're making weapons. And so it's the same with AI, it's like there's an internal mechanism to what AI is doing that means that you can't just impose an ethical system on it. You can recognize the ethical possibilities of it and you can try to implement them as best you can. But there are certain things, for example, the near infinite amount of power that it can give certain aspects of reality. It's something that. It doesn't matter what ethical system you apply to. Right. Whatever ethical system you try to apply to something which has massive power is not going to hold."}

So one of the things that's happening. So for example, we're trying to. Sorry, I'm stuttering. Because there's so many different things to think about. But there are ways in which people are trying to make certain that the ethical systems are as ethical as. But sorry, the AI systems are as ethical as possible. So there are loads and loads of people working on like, technical aspects of how do we ensure privacy. So there's big issues with privacy because of all the data that's being collected all the time, but not the data that's being collected for ways in which we could analyze it. So you can extract stuff out of the data that you had no idea that you could extract, for example, so they could work out. They can work out from. They can work out from your shopping habits whether or not you might be developing dementia. They can work out your mood from how you're typing. They can work out all sorts of things about you can guess all sorts of things about you by analyzing the data. So the way in which we think about privacy is all being shaped by how we use the tech at the same time as we're trying to make certain that the tech guards our privacy. Is that the kind of thing you're thinking of? So the ways in which the technology lures us into posting stuff on social media, the way in which it manipulates our emotions so that it tends to. Like Twitter, for example, tends to incite the worst emotions. It tends to get at your kind of, like, angry feeling so that you'll then reveal things about yourself that you wouldn't ordinarily reveal. So the way in which we're thinking about the notion of the self, how we relate to other people, how we think about all those things, is changing all at the same time as we're trying to control it. Exactly. Is that something."}

And I think that one of the things we saw with, like, Covid, you know, I did this interview with Christian roy about Marsha McLuhan, and he talks about how McLuhan said that we're basically already the sex organs of the machine. And it's like, it sounds like something witty to say. And, you know, you think, okay, yeah, that's really pithy.

They're just a helpless pawn and could do nothing. So there's a sense in which they are. There's a combination. It's like they're the Doctor rebels, henchmen or something. They're actually working in conjunction with it. But, yeah, so the way. I think it's really interesting how the way in which we relate to each other through all this zoom and distance meetings is changing so much. Of course, one thing to remember is that lockdown hasn't changed the lives. Some people's lives haven't been changed very much at all. So the people who are delivering, they're still going out delivering. So. But it's like, it's perhaps interesting as well, the way in which it helps to divide people because it's basically, as you could point out, there was a TWEET the other day that I really laughed at. But of course, you know how tweets are always taken too literally these days? Somebody said, in reality, there has been no lockdown. Middle class people have been hiding while working class people bring them stuff. So there's."}

We have different experience of it, but the way in which we'd relate to each other, say, over zoom, is really, really interesting because it changes how we think of ourselves because it makes you much more conscious because you can see yourself. So you're thinking, I look stupid. Do I look stupid? You know, what's in the background? I nearly gave a class a couple of months ago and realized that I had my washing in the background, so I didn't want the students to see my washing. It's all that sort of thing. But how we relate to the other person. So even the visual information you get from a camera, even a really good camera, it's a tiny fraction of what you'd get if you were in the room with a person."}

Because you don't realize that when you're with someone, you notice very small things.

Like, you know, you notice how. You notice, like, how dirty someone's hair is, or like, it's like these little things that you sense when you're with someone, and it's gives you an impression of how that person's doing or what's kind of going on around them. Whereas with zoom, you know, and it's just. It's a. It's another version of something like social media. You know, I've argued for a while that social media is basically, you know, a form of showing yourself and then watching other people. It's like entertainment brought to the individual level. And it's not true. It's not true interaction. Right. It's a form of even this. Like, obviously we're having a public discussion. Right? This is the same discussion we would have if we were sitting together in a coffee shop."}

But then one of the things I was thinking about in terms of. In terms of. I was thinking about it in terms of how AI AI sort of runs on electricity and the importance of electricity. And then it occurred to me, but of course, we run on electricity as well as biological creatures. And our electric fields from our bodies extend beyond our bodies. So I actually have no idea what impact that would be and whether you could pick it up from other people if you're in the same room as people. I'm just thinking about the physical distance of.

Why would that. Like, I don't know why that would bother anybody. Like, why would that bother you? Because animals have all kinds of ways of perceiving that are not just like the four senses or whatever. So I think that you're right that we. Obviously, this technology is. Is extremely focusing. Like, it's extremely limiting in terms of our human experience. And with my kids, I see it. It's nuts. Like, my kids, we had very limited tech in our house. Very, very limited. Like an hour of watching something a week, pretty much. And then Covid hit, and we just lost absolute. There was no way. Because the only way they could have contact with their friends was through.

So it just occurred to me, but like the family I'm from, like my mum and dad, especially my dad, really, we're not the sort of family who actually spoke very much. You know, we weren't terribly chatty, you know what I mean? But you still want to go and see somebody and you would, like. I'd often spend hours with my dad just like sitting together in silence. And it's that kind of thing thinking about that made me really realize how this is all focusing towards certain aspects of human experience only.

But I was going to say, for example, that system, let's say this system now, if you try to apply an ethical layer on top of that, it's limited by the very system itself.

But I was just going to point out something, something really paradoxical at this, about how this is, if this relates to AI and computing. So the value of AI, we can see the currency of that is intelligence. And trying to introduce cognitive capacity and intelligence as if that's the most important part of human beings. But then how it treats us, it's nothing to do with intelligence. It's hitting the sort of baser part of ourselves. It's like hitting raw emotion and not just even general emotion, but just a really. Just a really attenuated part of it. So the ways in which. Yeah, so this is an aspect of control that's like really, really disturbing, I think, and really, really worrying and also a big split in how. On what values there are in the system. So you especially see this in a lot of a futuristic, futuristic talk about AI. It's as if there's a lot of futuristic talk, as if humans are, okay, we're pretty intelligent, we've come as far as we can get, and then the next stage is going to produce even more intelligence to try to either have a transhumanist to extend our intelligence, or maybe just see that biology has got its limits and we need to go into a digital form and get more and more and more intelligence. So there's that aspect of it. But then how we're being treated is we're being. We're being basically being treated like farm animals. We're just basically being treated like, like objects."}

But what I think that, like, when Facebook and Twitter started, they basically, they understood one insight, which is attention. We just need to keep people's attention. And then they didn't at all realize that the easiest way to get someone's attention. Right. Is through appealing to the lizard brain. Right. Appealing to the rawest emotion you can appeal to.

So one of the narratives is there's an idea that AI is going to take over, it's going to do a lot of work for it, make life better for humanity in general. And that's the beneficial AI movement is all about that. But if you look at a lot of the things that's happening with things like social media and Facebook, there's an underclass. There's all sorts of work, all sorts of hidden work that's going out to human beings actually doing it. So appalling jobs doing content moderation, which are generally really, really poorly paid and a job that no human being should have to do. Having to look at the really. It's just horrendous. And a lot of the stuff like in machine learning is farmed out to people, people who are labeling images and doing sorts of. It's actually people doing the labor. So in a sense it's a bit of a.

But then there's also the problem that it's really interesting how it creates itself because one of the reasons. So it all feeds into then cultural issues. So one of the reasons why you might. So let's suppose we take the idea of hate speech. One of the reasons why there's so much stuff which counts as hate speech is because of how social media works. It encourages it. So it's created a problem and then it's trying to solve a problem, but it all spills over into society because as well as this happening, we have issues going on in culture where people are now falling out, having rows, getting thrown off social media, all those kinds of stuff. And then the idea of hate speech is then getting built into laws, various kind of laws. So there's a really interesting. This is one of the reasons why I think we need to modify the idea that or the sex organs of a machine, because there's far more complex going on as well.

It's really interesting. It's really interesting, but you have no idea what to do about it. But it's also interesting that a lot of People working on it, I think, haven't actually necessarily thought about the problem of being. The problem of being ousted because of hate speech, because they assume. Because a lot of people working on this problem. There are lots and lots of people working on this problem technically, and looking at hate speech and how the algorithms work and so on. But a lot of them have certain assumptions, I've noticed, have certain assumptions where it hasn't occurred to them that the hate speech is going to be biased in certain directions. So actually, it was interesting a couple of months ago, I was reading a paper where some researchers had looked at an algorithm that Facebook uses and how it tends to be biased towards what they called hyperactive users. So certain users who are online a lot and comment a lot, and so the algorithm boosts them so they get more visibility in Facebook. So you might kind of think, well, good for them. They're putting in the effort. But they were concerned about this. When I first read it, I said, they're concerned about it because these groups tend to be far right. But then when I read it again, I'd actually misread it. They were just concerned that the groups were right wing. So it wasn't that they were concerned that they have a certain. They're biased politically. It's because they're concerned that they were right wing. Hang on a second. You are allowed to be right wing, aren't you? Last time I looked. It's because they have. The people writing it have got themselves. Their particular bias."}

A lot of the stuff that's going on is really contradictory. So on the one hand, a lot of the AI, a lot of the AI is tending towards uniformity. So uniformity of language, the dominance of English, the dominance of Particular sorts of English, actually the dominance of American English and, oh, things like, you know that when we spoke before, we were talking about that.

And also because it's because, let's say people with alternative gender like identification are so rare, but because they appear as a marginalized group on the social media platforms. So the social media platforms want to protect them because they're a marginalized group, therefore bolster their voice, therefore make them appear as a substantive like category of human, of society, when in reality, you know, like actual transgender people are like, how many people? Like, unless you were in that scene, you'll maybe meet one or two transgender people, you know, in the world. Like, you rarely meet people like that unless you like really in a certain scene. So I mean, that's just. That's fine, it's reality, but it's just, it just like you said, the very system itself creates this weird thing.

Who wants to exclude people? But because there's such a concern about being biased in the data and biased online, that feeds into the idea that you need to protect these minorities because of a focus on particular minorities. But I also discovered something really interesting. You know, Facebook's famous 70 different, two different genders identities that you can have. I was looking it up and you could, if you put in your gender, you have to start typing it. If you drop down menus, a different, different sorts of. Different sorts of ones.

So when people talk, I mean, if you say anything critical, it sounds like you're against trying to get rid of bias.

It's not the problem of saying you want to get rid of bias. It's the problem of saying you want to get rid of bias, but secretly wanting to impose your bias on everybody else. That's really the problem. Right. It's not like if we had a normally, like if we had like a normally recognized hierarchy of being that. It's like we recognize it, we see its problem. We see it's. And we just say, this is what it is. Right? That say, like, the ancient world is like, okay, so you have the king, you have the bishop or the priest or the pope, and it's like. And then the world kind of lays itself out, so you can hate the king, but he's still above you. And you recognize that hierarchy. And then the world kind of lays itself out in that way, and everybody kind of knows that that's how it happens. But now, because we say, no, there is no hierarchy. It's equal and it's objective and it's all this stuff. But then secretly there is a hierarchy. There's like a secret hierarchy and a secret bias that no one wants to acknowledge. This is something that has been frustrating so many people in the media as well. Like, not just media, like media and social media companies, that they keep saying that they're being objective, but obviously they're not. We just wish they would tell us, just say that you're not.

But let's. I mean, one of the really interesting things about the emphasis on bias is because I think it also speaks to an idea about the idea about how AI sees what's wrong with humans, a way in which AI might seem to be better than humans. So it's like, if you. This is talking in really, really crude, simplistic terms, but if you think of AI as being better than us because of the intelligence and its data processing capacity, then it's as if the problems with human decisions come in from our biases. And that's because of our emotions, which the emotions are getting in the way of getting to the right answer and being completely objective. So that's really, really interesting because the emotions are seen as. So, on the one hand, having these emotions and being biased because of our emotions seem to be a problem. Whereas at the same time, as we've seen, the whole system is working on manipulating our emotions. So it's kind of like it's slapping us around the face, accusing us of stuff, but then encouraging us to do the same thing. You know what I mean? Yeah."}

There's a private dwelling exception for like hate speech that you could like, basically. But if you're inside your say things in your house, well, there's discussions about whether we should get rid of that. But I kind of think that what's happening on social media is, is like warming the brain up for thinking that maybe that's a good idea. But of course, luckily there's a huge backlash against it. There's a huge backlash against it. So one of the things that's happening in lockdown is we're forced into all this social media. But I do wonder what might happen when, if we ever get out of it. I kind of think we might be like, have you ever seen cows let out at the end of a winter? You know, when they're left under the fields and age over? I think we might be like that. So.

Helps to remind us of what our real human values are. So."}

And if you can use the things you're saying to put a mirror up to people so that we can see ourselves in the way that we talk about AI and the narratives that are surrounding AI, that's probably the first step in helping us to avoid the major pitfalls."}

But I also think one of the big problems, one of the background problems for when people are trying to think about the ethical issues here, the paucity of how they're thinking about it. So a lot of. A lot of the work that I see around AI ethics is basically built into what you might broadly call broadly utilitarian or broadly consequentialist ways of looking at things, which also fits into the ways in which intelligence is understood. So those are really interesting narratives, I think, as well. I mean, running behind AI. So there's lots and lots of different disputed definitions of how you might define intelligence and lots of different forms of intelligence. But the form that's often used, which fits really well with computing, is the idea that something along the lines of intelligence is the capacity to reach your goals, to be able to take steps to reach your goals. So that intelligence is just instrumental, but it's just like an instrumental account of like a means end rationality that you have a goal that you're aiming to. Aiming towards. So then it fits really neatly. It fits really, really naturally into a utilitarian way of looking at things where you're going to try to produce as much benefit as possible. We have certain goals and preferences so that it fits into notions of trying to maximize happiness or minimize unhappiness, or looking at how we might achieve our desires or achieve our preferences. So it tends to fit into that. So one of the problems with that is that it fits into an idea of reason that fits really well into say like an enlightenment ideal of reason. That we're just making progress because we're having more and more rationality or we're achieving more and more of our goals. Like a Steven Pinker type view."}

I don't actually mind that way of seeing intelligence, the capacity to reach your goals. It's just that there are higher goals and there are lower goals."}

It's a world of whims and desires and pleasures and pain. Whereas virtue and the good, let's say in a Christian sense or a Platonic sense, that's the goal. Right. That, that's actually the actual goal of reality. And not only is it the goal of reality, but it is also the Achilles heel of artificial intelligence, which is why it has to farm. Because what it's farming from people is not, is not just. It's not information, it's the good, it's. It's farming quality. The capacity to recognize quality and to engage in quality is. That's the purpose."}

I can't say that word. Making instrumental. The capacity to view quality in order to attain practical more like money making and desire. Desire filling goals. So."}

I agree, but I think that's one of the points where. That's one of the points where it might flip and turn on its head because people will realize the futility of it. So you can see those kinds of things in narratives or discussions around what we might do if super intelligent AI develops, how we might be protected. So the idea that you might need to. One of the worries, it's like the wish fulfillment worry. But if you program a super intelligent AI to say, make us happy, then what it might do is like plug us into electrodes so that we're just getting our pleasant centers stimulated."}

Actually, it's interesting because these debates have been going on in philosophy for a long time. So the utilitarian, it comes out of the discussions about utilitarianism. People have been talking about this for a long. Because they discovered decades ago that's what rats would do. If you put their brains. That's what they do. They do it until they collapse with exhaustion. So. But of course, you would have to be out of your mind, out of your tiny mind to think that that was a good way of living life, wouldn't you? You would have to be out of your tiny mind. So then you. Then there's a branch was looking at. We need to try to fulfill human desires. But you also really quickly realize that fulfilling your desires. Which desires? So there's a problem about which desires you choose. But it makes it worse because of what AI is already doing to us, because it makes it absolutely apparent how easily our desires can be manipulated."}

So it's better to have Zuckerberg, like moronic Zuckerbergs for now than have someone who actually understands, let's say, the qualitative aspect of the human person and how it looks for communion, real communion, and towards a transcendent ideal. And then like they. You don't want them to get a grab of that and try to plug us into that. Because that's going to be."}
