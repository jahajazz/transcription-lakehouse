And he will be the light of the nations and the hope of those whose hearts are troubled. All who dwell on the earth will fall down and worship him. And they will praise and bless and celebrate with song the lord of spirits. First Enoch, chapter 48, verses 4 through 5. The modern world doesn't acknowledge, but is nevertheless haunted by spirits, angels, demons and saints. In our time, many yearn to break free of the prison of a flat secular materialism, to see and to know reality as it truly is. What is this spiritual reality like? How do we engage with it? Well, how do we permeate everyday life with spiritual presence? Orthodox Christian priests Father Andrew Stephen Damick and Fr. Stephen DeYoung host this live call in show focused on enchantment in creation, the union of the seen and unseen as made by God and experienced by mankind throughout history.

This is one of those words that gets used a lot by Christians all the time, but often without a clear sense of what it is or even how the way that we use the word has been deeply influenced by non Christian philosophies. So how is the soul actually understood in the scriptures? And how different is that from the common conception? So that's what we're going to be talking about tonight. I'm not sure if you're going to walk away feeling like your mind is more bent or a little bit clearer, but I guess we'll just see what happens."}

We'll call it the conclusion of a planned trilogy, even though we're stretching the definition of planned a little there. Anytime it's used regarding me, the definition of the word planned is stretched."}

And I'll add this, which is, you know, I like to look up etymology to see if possibly that sheds some kind of light on what we're discussing. But the truth is that the English word soul, it comes from Old English, it heads all the way back to a proto Indo European word that literally means exactly the same thing the whole time. Like, it is a persistent word that has always meant this, which is pretty rare, but as a result sheds no."}

And this is it. Yeah. So we're going to start, as is our want, at the beginning of the book of Genesis. And this is part of where we started back in the aforementioned episode where we started talking about this a little. And this is with. Even though this isn't the first time the word that's translated, soul, appears, this is where we're going to start. And then we're going to back up almost immediately and pick up the previous one. But in Genesis 2, verse 7, we read about the creation of Adam. Right. The creation of man. He's formed from the dust of the earth. And then. And then it says, sorry, pregnant pause for dramatic effect."}

The Latin word for anima."}

And while you say, right, you can't separate that out. You can't quantify that. Right. You can't. Despite many efforts in the late 19th and early 20th century, where they would weigh bodies of dying people to see if they could determine how much the soul weighed after."}

In a scientific way, but at the same time, right. If you've. If you've ever watched a person die, which in our modern society, a lot of people who aren't priests haven't. But if you've ever had to put a pet down, right. If you've ever watched something that was alive die, you know that there's a palpable difference between that being the moment before and the moment after."}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #066 - 2023-04-27 - Who Stole the Soul -","start":636.35,"end":766.45,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"A change has taken place, Right. The life that was there, that life is now gone. So even though we can't scientifically quantify it, we all know this experientially, right? Experientially, we know that it is in some sense that the life, the soul is a thing, but not a thing in the sense we normally talk about it in material terms. So as we sort of briefly mentioned in passing, in terms of Genesis 2. 7, the Hebrew word for soul is nephesh. Those consonants, those three consonants are shared in every Semitic language I know of. That's as the word for soul. Vowels, of course, are different because words are vocalized differently in different Semitic languages, but the consonants are the same. And the way it is used, because words, of course, have their meaning from usage, is when you survey sort of all the uses, that term available to us is that in addition to places where it's obviously talking about life and being alive, it is used to refer to desires and appetites. So that idea is deeply connected here at sort of the base level, from Akkadian on. In Switic languages, the idea of desiring, the idea of appetite and the idea of being alive. Right. So it may not be obvious how that applies to all kinds of creatures, Right. We've said before on the show everything alive has a soul, but there are different types of souls, right? So a tree has a soul, a dog has a soul, a human has a soul, but they're different kinds of souls."}

It may not be obvious that a tree has appetites and desires, but of course, if you study plants, right. If you study them at all, you know that they do, right?"}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #066 - 2023-04-27 - Who Stole the Soul -","start":803.72,"end":807.84,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Toward it, which is weird. Like they don't have ears, but somehow."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #066 - 2023-04-27 - Who Stole the Soul -","start":807.84,"end":816.04,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Yeah, yeah, Right. So roots grow toward water, leaves grow toward the sun to get sunlight."}

It's purely at the level of just nourishment, but it's there. Right. And animals, of course, have those same kind of drives, plus some additional ones. Right. So, I mean, they're looking for nourishment, they're looking for food, they're looking for these things, but they're also looking to reproduce. And not only reproduce the way like plants reproduce themselves, but animals, especially as you get higher up, more, More advanced animals in terms of their socialization and social forms. They have social forms. Right. They will travel in packs, they will have hierarchies within those packs. They will mate for life, they will raise their young. Right. And so there are these other additional sort of desires and appetites as you move into the type of soul that an animal has. Right. And then, of course, when you get to a human, it becomes sort of all the more complex in terms of our desires and our. And our appetites and how we relate to those. So it shouldn't totally shock us if we learn a little Hebrew and we read Genesis 1, verse 20, and we."}

Right. It says this. And God said, let the water swarm with the swarms of living souls or creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the expanse of the heavens. That they say. Well, see, it says water. The waters have souls in them, but the heavens don't. Doesn't say souls for birds. And there's a whole argument then saying that birds don't have souls, which. I don't know what the point of that is, but it's out there. I'm not kidding. I've seen this."}

But yeah, yeah. And so when we're talking about a soul here, to an extent, we're talking about going beyond just the life of a living being. Here's another angle on it. We're talking about a kind of embodied desiring."}

And that embodied part is important because this isn't just body in the broad sense, the way we usually use it a lot on Northern spirits. This is body is in a biological body. Right. Biological body has a soul. So we don't talk about angelic beings having souls. Right, right, right. Angel souls. And if someone. I don't know who would do this, and I'm certainly not going to mention his name again because I've mentioned it enough. But if someone were to say that God is a tri. Personal, immaterial soul.

And so that's why it gets included when the same idea is being expressed, right, in Greek. So if there isn't a word for it, how is this distinction expressed back in the Hebrew Bible?

And that means that effectively noasis, which is the property of the noose. Right. Is something that exists in other forms, in other forms of life besides humans, but again, not in the same way. So there is a unique connection and a unique type of soul. We're going to get into this more in the second half that a human has that is unique and different as we go on and get further and deeper into our definition of what a soul is. That is different than that of any other living thing in creation. And that is for a reason. Because remember, humanity is formed in the image of God. Humanity is created to continue the creative work of God, which is to put the creation in order and fill it with life. That includes other living things in creation. That includes animals, that includes plants. Plants and animals are linked. They also eat each other. But that we put them in order and we foster that life. This is why, as we've talked about before, the garden is sort of the perfect image of this. A garden is in order, right? It is in good order, but that good order has not produced sterility. Rather, that good order has allowed the life within the garden to flourish. So it's that perfect combination of the two. Right. And so when humanity is created and is sent to turn the world, originally to turn the world into a garden, into paradise. Right? Part of that includes the world being humanized, the inhuman parts of the world being humanized by being put in order and being filled, filled with life. Plants being cultivated by humans, animals being domesticated by humans, and through those, they are transformed. We don't have time to go through all this here, but there are some good documentaries online about the history of wheat."}

And that's changed them and transformed them in ways that most of us consider positive. So the rest of creation finds its fullest connection to God through humanity. Ideally. Right. But this is also why the fact that that's how creation can find its fulfillment is through humanity. And humanity finds its fulfillment in the humanity of Christ. That also means that when humans turn to sin and evil. Right. As Adam found out, cursed is the ground because of you. That also has effects on the rest of creation and can have the opposite effect of disorder, sterility. Right. On the rest of creation due to. Due to our sin. Because we form the rest of creation after ourselves. And if we're disconnected from God, then the rest of creation will be too, when we get done with it. So if the soul is the life of a living being, and we've talked a little bit more about soul, but we have to also define the word life."}

Right. Life is that thing that is gone when something dies. Right. But that's a negative definition, not a positive definition. It's sort of not being dead.

{"episode_id":"LOS - #066 - 2023-04-27 - Who Stole the Soul -","start":2705.94,"end":2761.22,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Right. So there's your definition of life. Right. Life is knowing God the Father and knowing Jesus Christ. And you come to do the former through the latter. You come to know the Father by coming to know our Lord Jesus Christ. That's what life is. And so in the past, several times on Lord of Spirits, we've referred to St. John of Damascus's discussion of the difference between physical death and spiritual death. Right. So he says that physical death is the separation of the soul from the body. Right. The soul leaving the body, the life departs from the body, and spiritual death is the separation of the soul from God."}

But what we see in what Christ says here in St. John's Gospel is that then there is a corresponding distinction and connection between faith, physical life and spiritual life. So physical life is the connection. Right. The union of the soul with the body, a La Genesis 2, 7, where we started out."}

And so one of our definitions then here, if this is our definition of life, and if soul. If the soul of a living being is the life of the living being, then the soul represents the connection to God of a living being through which it has physical, biological life. That means everything living is connected to God. Right. Not everything living is God is part of God. Right."}

You can't consume it. You have to pour it out. You have to return it to God. The blood of sacrifices, Leviticus, poured out at the base of the altar. You can't consume it because it's the life. And then in that same context, in Genesis 9, right there, at the same time that he's saying this, he says this applies in a unique and special way to human blood because humanity is made in the image of God. And because humanity is made in the image of God, he will demand an account for every drop of human blood spilled. And he goes so far as to say not only from every person who spills human blood, but from every animal that spills human blood, he's going to demand an account."}

My new book, An Introduction to Extra Biblical Literature, is now available. A lot of Christians today divide ancient Jewish and Christian literature into Two categories, what's in the Bible, what's not in the Bible? Christian east, however, has traditionally had a third category, a middle category, books that are read privately in the home. The Greek word for that is apocrypha. These texts from the centuries before and the centuries after the incarnation of Christ that go beyond even the larger canons of Orthodox and Roman Catholic churches, reveal to us the religious world and theological framework of the apostles and early church fathers. In this book, Apocrypha, I survey these works which connect elements of liturgy, scripture, iconography, patristic writings. Familiarity with these works will enhance readers understanding of the breadth and depth of the Orthodox Christian faith. Buy your copy of An Introduction to Extra Biblical literature and@store.ancientfaith.com that's store.ancientfaith.com we're."}

And as a part of the reason that everything is a mess. Could that be said in light of what you're teaching us now as being, since we're, you know, at war, so to speak? Not so to speak.

If there's not really, like, a separate self, it made me wonder, well, then if you have a loved one who is hit with, like, dementia or Alzheimer's, I mean, does that mean, like, the person you knew and lost is. Is gone? Like a hard drive just being wiped out?"}

It's interesting. We talked about them as sort of not being all there. Right. Like, that's the language that we use. But, yeah, I mean, it's. It's. Number one, I'm not a psychologist, I'm not a doctor or anything like that, but my understanding of the condition is that it's. It is an impairment of the way that the. The mind within, you know, the mind functions as it manifests itself to us. Right. So that doesn't mean that they're. That they're gone or that they're lost, you know, because still there's life in the body, right? So there's still that organizing principle, even if it's functioning at what might appear to us to be kind of a lower level of consciousness at the moment, but there. There's still themselves, you know, even if there's all kinds of wacky behavior going on or maybe Sometimes almost no behavior going on. Right. Because there's all kinds of levels of dementia. Like there's the kind where you just forget stuff and then there's all the way to the point where you're just lying there, you know?"}

I mean, I've known people like, I've done pastoral work with people where their dementia advances and they become very violent, for instance, you know, and just. Or they start cussing a lot, whereas they would never would have. You know, those kinds of restraints would have been in place before. They wouldn't have done that stuff. They would not have obeyed those impulses, you know. But I would definitely not say that their soul is gone because the body is still alive. I don't know, Father, you want to add or correct or adjust to me."}

Right. If you are your soul and your soul is some kind of psychological self or something, then it would seem to me that that's where you're kind of losing a person. And that's also where you get arguments like Peter Singer back in the day that unborn children and even infants aren't human. Yeah, right, right. If you are embodied, desiring, if you are a living soul, you are a body that is animated. That is what you are as a person. Then a fetus in the womb, a six month old, a three year old, a 20 year old, a 30 year old, a 75 year old, an 85 year old with dementia is still that person. Regardless of their ability to interact, regardless of their facility with language, regardless of how their memory is, regardless of what they're able to articulate, what math they can do, what abstract concepts they can comprehend, there's still a human person, and they're still the same human person, just at different stages in their life, but they're still the person. So to me, this is an important distinction to make. For that reason, if the body's just a husk and the real you is this nebulous thing within, if you lose contact with that nebulous thing within, you might be inclined to think that the person is gone, even though the person is standing right there in front of you."}

So the Greek word for soul famously, is psyche, sometimes pronounced in English, psyche. It's where we get psychology, etcetera, Psychic.

And so that seems an obvious connection, right, in terms of why this word, this Greek word, but the Greek word sikhi also includes the idea of will and desire. Right. Just like we talked about the Hebrew term including kind of desire and appetite. That idea is included. Also the idea of will. Now, this is the concept of the natural will. Not the way we commonly use will when we talk about free will, like making choices. We won't go down the whole Saint Maximus the Confessor rabbit hole right now on that. But the natural will is something which every living being has, which is sort of the internal push, the internal motor that directs them to continue living and to grow and to thrive. Right. So the. The acorn has the same nature as the oak tree."}

And stretch out the roots and stretch out the branches, Right. That's what we're talking about with the natural will, Right. Like I will live, I will grow, I will thrive. Right, yeah, that kind of thing. Whereas the choose the will in terms of decision making. In terms of making choices is. Right. I'm going to have Apple Jacks instead of golden Grahams this morning for breakfast. Right. Which is usually a good choice. But if you get the original recipe, golden grams with the honey in the recipe. Yeah, that might win. So you don't want them newfangled golden grahams."}

Yeah, so it's that kind of will that we're talking about in the soul, that the soul has this sort of internal drive. And so in Greek thought. So when you talk about Greek thought, we're talking about Greek philosophy, right? Basically, in Greek thought, there are these different powers of the soul. And not everything that has a soul has all of these powers. In fact, which powers of the soul a given living creature possesses is going to determine kind of what kind of creature it is."}

This is more the animal level that includes some of those things we talked about in the first half, like mating for life, caring for offspring, these more advanced things. But also includes, for example, animals will eat more than they need to eat to survive. Right. They have other kinds of desires, they have social desires, other kinds of desires that they want to seek to be fulfilled beyond just eating. The minimum to survive, procreating, surviving, the elements. Right. There are sort of more advanced desires than that. And then humans only in Greek thought have the noetic power of the soul, right? So in Greek thought, the nous is seen as a power of the soul. It is reduced to and made part of essentially the soul. And of course, as we mentioned, only humans have it in Greek thought. Everything else is not conscious. Everything else lights off. Right. In this ancient Greek thought. But because. Right. Notice the nous is folded into the soul."}

Because he says the big problem with humans just being heads is that as they were rolling around, they would roll into ditches and get stuck places. Again, he's not intending us to necessarily take this literally. And therefore they needed to develop bodies by necessity to sort of carry the head around and feed themselves and interact with things in order to keep the head alive. To keep the soul in the head. Right. But beyond, you know, the story sounding kind of goofy. Right. The point he's conveying, and it goes all through Plato's writings and is the earmark possibly of the Platonic tradition. Right. Is this kind of dualism where the body is a vehicle that transports the soul around."}

Yes. You know, effectively. I mean, it's not a. Like we. I'm sure we owe a bunch to Descartes as well, but it's still. I mean, it's basically Plato. It's.

And so this is embedded even in our language in ways we don't realize. So, for example, the Greek word organon literally means a tool or an instrument.

Our identity is not this internal thing that's eternal that we're born with and that we later discover.

That's what forms our identity. And so the big problem with identity in our culture is that everyone is so isolated and alienated from everyone else that they're sitting in front of their computer and they don't know who they are because they don't have any of these relationships or community structures or family or social structures. And Aristotle made this plan a long time ago. If you live alone, you can't be human. If you live alone, you're either a beast or a God. Animals can live alone. He thought the gods could hypothetically live alone, but humans can't. So you're either gonna have to become superhuman, like, say, St. Anthony, who became like God out the desert, or you're going to become subhuman.

And so sometimes when people hear the orthodox language of, well, humans. Right. It's. And it's said in different ways that are kind of sloppy. It's not that they're wrong. It's just they give the wrong impression based on all of this cultural baggage. Right. They'll say that, well, well, humans have a material part and an immaterial part. And so they're sort of the bridge between the spiritual world and the physical world. And what. That kind of makes it sound like, if you've got a bad case of Plato, brain from growing up in our culture is, well, my soul is like, living in the spiritual world, or at least potentially could, and my body is here living in the material world. And so you go and do DMT or something to enter the spiritual world or try different meditative practices to enter the spiritual world and leave the material world behind. And all of this. This is a fundamental misconstrual of what all that means, right?"}

But what we're talking about when we talk about humans being that bridge, it's precisely having this unique connection to God in Christ. Right? Because remember, life is not only knowing God the Father, but also knowing Jesus Christ, whom he sent. It's through Christ that this connection, right, this special human connection comes into being. And so it is that we are connected to God and to what God is doing in the world, both the visible and invisible creation that allows us to serve that bridge. And why the transfiguration, the redemption of the world happens through its humanization. Because in Christ, humanization becomes divinization. But we'll talk about that more in the third half. Yeah, but last, last note here, Right. This is why, as we mentioned before in the unction episode, bodily resurrection is so critically important to Christianity."}

I also include an eight week bereavement curriculum that can be used in a group or on one's own.

But before we take you caller, I just want to mention that we are still selling tickets for the Lord of Spirits Conference to be held at the end of October at the Antiochian village in Ligonier, Pennsylvania. You can go to store.ancientfaith.com events and get your tickets. There's only, I think, I don't know, a couple dozen spots left. Like we're looking at close to 250 people coming. It's pretty great. And there are now there are cabins because we've sold out the Antiochian Village Conference center completely. But now you can actually get cabins at the camp which is right next to the conference center. And you can fit eight people in each one of those cabins. It's much cheaper, but it's not quite the level of amenities that you would get down at the conference center or some other hotel or whatever. But it is a very cheap option for lodging. So again, it's stored@ancientfaith.com events. It's gonna be a whole, whole lot of fun. Come the end of October, I fully expect to see at least one person in a bat costume.

{"episode_id":"LOS - #066 - 2023-04-27 - Who Stole the Soul -","start":6341.07,"end":6377.33,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Yeah, I mean, it's a good question. So, like, I think one particular element of. Is, as we've talked about the image of God many times before on the podcast, is that we are imagers of God. Right. And so the. The human soul is that connection to God. I mean, everything that has a soul is connected to God, but we're connected to God in a unique way in. In a human way. And we image God in the world in a way that everything else doesn't. Right. So that is at least the connection that I would immediately make. Pun fully intended, Father. I don't know. What would you add to that or expand outwards?"}

Right. And in the union of our shared humanity with God in Christ and what that means for humanity. Right. Christ did not become incarnate as any other kind of creature, angel or otherwise."}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #066 - 2023-04-27 - Who Stole the Soul -","start":6408.7,"end":6436.4,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"And so we tend to. This is the thing from an ecumenical council that I find we talk about the least. Chalcedon said that Christ is, according to his divine nature, consubstantial with the Father and the Spirit, and according to his humanity, consubstantial with us."}

Right. With our concept of individual and individual human person, and not that Christ represents the union of humanity that we share with him with God. And especially when we're talking about the human soul and also when we're talking about the image of God. Because this is where the wibbly wobbly timey wimey stuff comes in. Right. If you look at an icon of the creation of Adam, the way him being created in the image of God is expressed in our iconography is that you have Christ there shaping his body, and he looks like Jesus."}

Now, I was hoping that this is probably because I still have a very rudimentary understanding of the argument, but I was hoping you might elaborate at least a little bit. As long as it doesn't get too off from the show of how that relates to the dispute between the Orientals and the Orthodox.

Is because he's dealing with what the issues surrounding what's going to be the sixth Ecumenical Council, which is going to establish that Christ has two wills and why he's talking about the natural will, the gnomic will. We won't go again all the way down that rabbit hole. But so sort of the paradigmatic point in Scripture, for this is Christ in the garden of Gethsemane, right? When he says to his Father, not my will, but yours be done, right? If it be your will, take this cup from me. But not my will, but your will be done. What's going on there? Right? And the natural will that we were talking about, this quality of the soul, this drive is exactly why we say Christ had two wills, right? So Christianity, human soul, which is a faculty of his human nature, has a human natural will, which human natural will is the drive to live, right? To survive, right? To not die."}

Sometimes people think when we say that Christ has two wills, we're saying like he had two different minds or two different consciousnesses, like a human one and a divine one. Right?

What we're saying is that there is within him as a human having a human soul, a human will which caused him to grow to adulthood physically. Right? To human physical adulthood and to eat and these other things, right? And that's not bad. But that when the time came where right.

Anyways, my question is in regards to the body soul dynamic that you're talking about. So once you're dead and you've been in the ground for long enough, your body kind of goes away and becomes like some other thing. Like maybe it's eaten by it becomes like grass and then the full circle of life thing. So after everybody's resurrected, how would that resurrected body be you if it's not the same stuff that makes up the you that is currently you? If that makes sense."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #066 - 2023-04-27 - Who Stole the Soul -","start":7067.02,"end":7189.15,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Yeah. I mean, I'm tempted to just say, listen to the body episodes from way, way back. But I mean, just briefly, right? A body is not the stuff. Right. It's not reducible to the stuff. And the reason why that's the case is because, for instance, that most of the stuff that currently constitutes your body is not the same stuff that has always been there, right? You've traded out a lot of stuff over time and yet you're still you, right? So it's not about the parts, it's not about the atoms, the molecules, whatever. A body is the collection of all of these things together, right. It's not. You are not the sum of your materiality, right? So it doesn't matter that your atoms and molecules are going to get traded out. It doesn't matter that a king can make a progress to the guts of a beggar. That stuff doesn't matter. What matters is that you as your body are more than that, right? There's something going on there that's. And that's part of what the soul is, right? It's the life of all of that together. So, yeah, you don't lose consciousness by your, you know, your corpse decaying and you don't become a completely other person in the resurrection. You're still you, although you are a different person in the sense that your body's been transformed. You know, it's like St. Paul says that the resurrected body is almost, you know, relationship of a plant to a seed, you know, sown in corruption, raised in incorruption. So there's going to be a big difference. We don't know exactly what the difference is going to look like. Although it's going to be maybe sort of angelic on some level. But, you know, it's still you. You're still you, right? There's a persistent you in the midst of all of that. I don't know if father, you want to add or anything to that or Correct."}

It helps in the sense that we can make certain points. Right. Like St. Thomas could touch him. The wounds are still there. Right. St. Thomas can says, handle me and see, spirit has not flesh and blood or flesh and bones. Sorry. As you see, that I have. From which some people conclude, Jesus had no blood, which is just amazing to me. But anyway, I know it'll be flesh and bones, as you see, that I have. Right. So he was.

And all that connection is also not broken or negatively affected by the eventual bodily resurrection. In fact, it's deepened by the bodily resurrection. The bodily resurrection will be greeted as a good and beautiful and wonderful thing to be in the body. Again, sorry, Plato. Right. That is superior.

{"episode_id":"LOS - #066 - 2023-04-27 - Who Stole the Soul -","start":8471.1,"end":8474.46,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Because they're created beings, right? Unlike God."}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #066 - 2023-04-27 - Who Stole the Soul -","start":8478.94,"end":8592.99,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"And so it's a different kind of finitude, right? And St. John of Damascus says that God alone knows their limitations, right? They aren't obvious to us because right now, at least, we're below them, right? So we compare them to our own limitations, and they seem virtually limitless. But from God's perspective, they're limited, right? And he understands their limits because he put them there when he created them. But as we talked about in our episodes about episode about what a spirit is, spirits are these organizing principles of larger collective created realities. We talked about this, that a spirit is this organizing principle at a higher level of consciousness than an individual being, this organizing principle for a collective. And it's not immediately obvious how a finite being can do that. Yeah, Right. Like, I mean, we could think about like, you know, a general or a king, right? Who is, of course, a finite being. And he gives orders to other beings, right? But the general is not like the consciousness of his army, right? And the king does not represent in himself the consciousness of all his people. So it seems counterintuitive that a finite being could be that. Unless, of course, as the psalm in Hebrews says, God makes that finite being to be the consciousness, the organizing principle of a larger reality."}

He is sharing it, and that is how he is sharing it, right. He's not making him like the viceroy where God gives him orders and then he gives passes those orders on, right? That's external. This is different than that, right. Well, in the same way, if we understand this with angels, a human person is likewise a finite being, right? With a soul as the organizing principle of himself. Right? The soul functions as the spirit, as the organizing principle of the human person. That soul is connected to God in Christ, who is the Logos, right? And as the Logos is the organizing principle of everything, right. The whole creation. And so, as we quoted in St. John's Gospel, knowing God involves knowing Jesus Christ whom he sent. And so in a parallel way to the angels, through this connection of their soul to God in Christ, the saints are made organizing principles for larger collective realities through being in Christ. And so this is what lies behind the language of the saints in glory, being equal to the angels of their governing it's not this external governing right. And equal to the angels is not just status, it's a role and a function in activity."}

Right. Than the material human body. Right. Which they will have again at the resurrection. But this is also what's behind. And this is probably the. I mean, I was going to say it's the best place to understand this. This is a brain breaking part that's hard to wrap our heads around. Right. Because we're finite humans. But a place to see this, a way at this at least, is the idea of heavenly patronage, both of individual people and collectively."}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #066 - 2023-04-27 - Who Stole the Soul -","start":8829.32,"end":9207.48,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Yeah, yeah. So to wrap up, you know, one of the questions that comes up a lot just in Christian life and parish life. And I think this is a question that maybe kids ask more than adults, but I wish adults would ask it a little bit more. And that's this question of what, what is heaven like? Right. What does it mean to be saved ultimately? Right. Ultimately there's the same question. And you know, our minds, I think, because especially for those of us who grew up here in the United States, things we see on tv, our image of what heaven is like probably defaults in many cases the kind of cartoonish thing with people sitting around on clouds and playing harps. And of course that's. That's not it. Right. But then also we might get a little bit higher and sort of see this kind of ethereal again, cloud world with golden gates standing there and you know, all that kind of stuff. And I mean, I've had people tell me that they think that heaven sounds boring, that it sounds really, really dull. And. And it's usually because the imagination of it is something even less than what we saw in the Good Place, even less complex than that, less interesting than that. And one of my favorite expressions for what exactly it'll be like, which, again, we don't totally know. We know some things that we can. We can talk about some things that have been said in scripture, things that have been said by the saints and so forth. But one of my favorites, of course, comes from one of my favorite writers, and that's, you know, J.R. tolkien, where in one of his letters to one of his sons, he has this to say. He says, there is a place called heaven where the good, here unfinished, is completed and where the stories unwritten and the hopes unfulfilled are continued. We may laugh together yet, he says, and while I don't think that that encapsulates and it's not a sort of a. I would not describe it as a dogmatic definition of what the life of the age to come is like. I like it a lot because what it does is it helps us to see that the beauty and the good and all of those things that we love in this life that seem to be unfulfilled because of the imperfections of this life, because of the reality of what life in this world is actually about, that that is going to be fulfilled, completed, and especially, I like the word continued. He talks about stories unwritten are continued. And one of the reasons why I think that that's so beautiful, aside from just giving us an anchor from our own experience that we have now in order to try to imagine what it's going to be like, is that also it's an image that the life of the age to come is a creative life, that it is not simply this static thing right now, time is going to work differently for us. We're going to experience it differently than we do now, for sure. So we don't. What will motion without time look like? I don't know. Or whatever, you know, I don't know. But nonetheless, the idea that the life, the age to come is going to be a creative life and a constructive life, however that can be construed, I think is a very beautiful and hopeful thing. I heard someone one time react to some of the stuff we've said on this show and say, like, life, the age to come is basically becoming middle management. Like, well, no, because it's not like an earthly bureaucracy, right? Where all of that is really just super dull. It's not like that at all. It's instead it's a. An invigorating, energizing, creative, interesting existence. And again, we don't know exactly what it will look like. I probably said that 10 times now. But we do know that the saints who are experiencing it as a foretaste now, or depending how you understand time, they're fully experiencing it fully now, that they are joyful, you know, they're not showing up in dull suits and saying, oh, yes, I had to check 27,000 files just this morning. You know, that's not their experience. And it's also not showing up with robes and harps and stuff. Although, you know, a harp can be a beautiful image of creativity and all kinds of wonderful things. But, yeah, so I, you know, as we, as we conceive of the soul and try to get our heads around it as much as we can, I think that seeing the destiny in Christ of the soul, of the life of the body as being a truly lively life, that it is truly a. An energizing, energized, creative life puts a frame around what we're trying to accomplish as Christians that I think is really beautiful and hopeful and gives us a lot to fix our eyes on and strive towards, you know, that in Christ that this is where we're going, that we can become all love, you know, what an amazing even just thought to have, even if we don't quite understand the reality yet.

I know Harpers, they're almost as bad as the flautus. They'll really eat your lunch if they come after you. So, yeah, you mentioned this middle management thing and the sort of externality with which we view this idea of God's dominion over creation ultimately. And then, you know, the angelic beings and the saints who are going to participate in that. But it's as we talked about tonight, it's much more intimate and direct and deep than that. And as we've said a lot on the show, there's not sort of neutral ground to stand on. We talked about also in the second half, identity. And part of the problem with taking this kind of quasi Platonic approach of identity being something innate in me that I discern is that when people go to seek their identity and they don't realize that this identity is something that's going to be found outside themselves in relationships not just with other humans, but with other spiritual powers, be it the Holy Spirit being it some other Spirit is that they are very quickly led into certain traps. Because just like material nature, spiritual nature abhors a vacuum. There are plenty of powers and principalities out there that would love to get their hooks in you and form you and become the organizing principle of your life. Probably the biggest one in our culture here in the US and I imagine in most of the Anglophone world that would be listening to us is mammon, the pursuit of. And mammon, the Aramaic word, includes not just money, right? It includes that wealth, but it also includes the concept of reputation. And that may be in our very contemporary world, the world of social media, the world of instant and weird celebrity, where people are just famous. Not famous for doing anything, just famous. That desire for clout, for influence, for celebrity, maybe even the more powerful of the drives connected to mammon, even more powerful than the drive to get money, though that's certainly around too. And these competing things will very quickly seize hold of us, reorganize our life, reorganize our very identity, our sense of ourself, our sense of who we are, and begin to transform us, as we said in this life already, into something less than human, into something less than what God created us as and created us to be. And that is a progressive thing. It is a progressive thing. And if we aren't deliberate about becoming the person who God created us to be, then we will 100% fall into that. It takes work. It takes work to be a Christian. It takes hard effort. It takes determination. I tell people all the time, if you're trying to decide what to do, figure out what the easy thing is to do. Take that off the table. It's always wrong, 100%. We're going to have to do very hard things. We're going to have to do things that don't feel good because they don't gratify our desires. We're going to have to do things that go against the grain and that are difficult for us. And part of the reason they're going to be difficult for us is that we've been formed by these other things. Because we're literally going to be trying to become a different person. And that's not easy. Not pretend to be a different person, but actually become a different person. To actually have things be true of us that maybe aren't true of us today, but we want them to be true of us in the future. And we're going to have to work and fight to get to that truth. And we're gonna have to wean ourselves off of a Lot of the things that have become comfortable and pleasurable and have become crutches for us, right? Life in our world, as we've talked about before, our current world is constructed in an inhuman way. There is not a way to operate and function successfully in our world as it's structured today and be sane, right? And so some of the things we develop, we're developing as crutches just to try to survive in an insane world. But some of those crutches are alcohol, drugs, pornography, mindless, mindless entertainment patterns of self destruction, right? That we know. While they may be helping me get from today to tomorrow, they're not helping me become the person I was created to be. They're not helping me be a human being. They're not helping me find an experience and give and receive love. They're not producing joy in my life. They're not giving me a sense of peace. They're not bringing peace to the world around me. They're not solving the problems that are causing me to run to them in the first place. So my takeaway tonight is that each of us needs to become very deliberate about the person who we want to be in Christ. And we need to start with every decision we make, no matter how big or small, asking ourselves, is this going to bring me closer to that person who I was created to be in Christ, or is this going to take me farther away? This could be with decisions that seem minor. As minor as, what am I going to have for lunch, Is it a fast day or not? Or this can be as major as who should I be dating, who should I marry, what kind of job should I work at, what kind of career should I pursue? Should I pursue a career on, down the line? Because if we aren't doing that thinking right, if we aren't focusing, right, focusing ourselves and our attention on where we want to go, we will get pulled to all kinds of other places that we don't want to go. But there's always hope as long as you're alive, right? As long as you're alive, you can start making those decisions and start moving in that direction. No matter how far gone you've gone, you can start to head in that direction. But we have to start to act. Rather than just being acted upon, we need to start choosing who and what kind of spirit is going to be the organizing principle of our life. Not just falling into whatever one is nearby and seems attractive at the moment or wants to get its hooks in us. And if we do that, it will not be easy. There will not be a point where it gets easier. There will not be a point where we've arrived and it's like, okay, now I can coast. That's why Christ said if you want to follow him, you have to pick up your cross and follow Him. The walk you take with a cross ends with you being you dying upon it. But that is the road that leads through the cross to the resurrection, that leads to eternal life, which is something we begin to experience in this world and then continues into the next and ultimately into the life of the world to come."}
