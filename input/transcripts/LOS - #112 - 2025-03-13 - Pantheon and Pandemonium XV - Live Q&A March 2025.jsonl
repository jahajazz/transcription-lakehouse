All who dwell on the earth will fall down and worship him. And they will praise and bless and celebrate with song the lord of spirits. First Enoch, chapter 48, verses 4 through 5. The modern world doesn't acknowledge, but is nevertheless haunted by spirits, angels, demons and saints. In our time, many yearn to break free of the prison of a flat secular materialism, to see and to know reality as it truly is. What is this spiritual reality like? How do we engage with it? Well, how do we permeate everyday life with spiritual presence? Orthodox Christian priests Father Andrew Stephen Damick and Fr. Stephen DeYoung host this live call in show focused on enchantment in creation. This the union of the seen and unseen as made by God and experienced by mankind throughout history. Welcome to the Lord of Spirits."}

Well, I just noticed that this number one of one, number 111, that's my birthday, so something must be going on. All right, my question is, you recently had an episode on progress called what is Progress? And. But my question is, from my perspective, there are so many really bad, evil things happening in the world right now. I guess they always do, but especially the cleansing of Christians from all across the Middle east right now. What's happening in Syria, Armenian Christians, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, and the kind of warfare we see going on. And this may be expanding. So my question is, in terms of progress, what is the perspective of progress not from the linear standpoint of history, but from the standpoint of where we are as Orthodox Christians and sort of, if I can say, the arc of what we see as progress right now? And what, what do we do in the midst of all of this when things look like they're going very badly in a lot of sort of ways? Does that question make sense to you guys?"}

And also that providentially, the. It's not like God didn't know, you know, what would be happening at this moment in history. He absolutely knew every single little bit of it. Every, you know, subatomic movement. And this is exactly the. I mean, it sounds a little probably presumptuous to put it this way, maybe, but this is exactly the conditions needed for the salvation of everyone that's currently alive. This is, this is. This is. This is what, what he gave us. You know, and so, I mean, we know that a lot of saints were in super tough times. In fact, typically that's where we get our saints. It's from really difficult moments in history and, you know, time and space. And so while we ask for a, you know, a tranquil, peaceful life, and there's nothing wrong with asking for that. We just tend to know that repentance is more likely when that's not the case because we're, you know, when things are going well, we tend to get lazy about our salvation.

And in addition to sort of what Father Andrew said, part of the issue is that we always have this sort of constructed golden age in the past when things were better than they are now. That's part of how you get the downward trajectory. They used to be better. And there was no golden age of the Church. People will get mad at me for saying that."}

Somebody hadn't split communion with somebody else. There weren't two bishops somewhere. That's just not true. Right. And the Byzantine Empire was not a golden age. Most of the kings were heretics, cruel. They're not saints. Very few of the Byzantine emperors are saints who are mutilating people, killing people.

Has generated Christian culture. Right. And I think, I don't know if this is what you're asking about, but I've decided I'm going to rant on this for just a second. I Think that many times, especially Orthodox Christians in the west, whether it's people who have converted to Orthodoxy or those who grew up in it, often they look at those Christian cultures, and that is. I mean, this is like what you were saying, Father, like this idea of a golden age. And often people are like, okay, if we only get to that, if we can only build that here in America or build our own version of that or whatever, or we could have our American that. And they have that over there. We have this over here. And the problem with that approach is, like, there is a saying. I can't remember where he wrote it, but it's one of these sayings from. And I'm pretty sure that he actually did say this from C.S. lewis. People attribute a lot of crazy stuff to him that he never said. But there is something that I'm pretty sure he did say, which is, if you aim at heaven, you will get earth thrown in, but if you aim at earth, you will get neither. And I think that people who aim at Christian culture aren't actually aiming at Christianity. They're not actually aiming at Christ. The reason why we have. We get Christian culture is because there are people who are living as saints, and the culture kind of comes out of that, but it's not the point of it. You know, you can have. You can. From a heavenly perspective, you can have a glorious civilization that looks like trash from the worldly point of view, right? You can have a whole group of saints who are persecuted and not able to build a thing. And from heaven's viewpoint, it's this shining city, but from the world's viewpoint, it's nothing, you know, And I think that. That the key to any kind of, like, if we're thinking in terms of, like, the progress of a Christian nation or a Christian culture, whatever. Like, I think we just need to forget about that. It's not that those things are wrong. It's just that when you aim at that, that's not what you get. What you get, then, is actually something kind of borderline idolatrous, in my opinion. It has to be. We have to be aiming at trying to become holy, trying to be truly Christians. And it's Christians who build Christian culture. If you try to build Christian culture without actually having real Christians, then not only does it not work, you end up creating some dark, distorted version of it. So, anyway, that was kind of a rant that I just wanted to tack on since it seemed a little."}

No, it's not. We could discuss further if you want. But I do have a question about Isaiah 44. I think it's come up on the show before. But Isaiah 44 to me sounds like, you know, as a recovering materialist, it sounds like materialist critique of paganism. It kind of sounds like Isaiah is insulting people for worshiping things that have no power because people made them with their hands. And it's not clear to me what the thrust of the argument is. It sounds as if he's saying, because, you know, the source and the material of an idol that makes it impotent. But listening to you all, it sounds to me like the source of power for an idol comes from the demon that sits behind the material. And so if that question makes sense, I'd love to understand again, kind of the thrust of the argument for that."}

So the idea is, right, why are you worshiping this idol? Well, if we're talking about Israel in that period, it's probably an idol of baal. Now if they're worshiping baal, it's because they want fertile crops and. Or fertile wife. Right. They want children, they want the rains to come in their season. He's a storm God. Right. And they want fertile crops. So they believe that baal, the spiritual being can help them get their wife pregnant and can help their crops grow and can send rain."}

But BAAL can't carve a statue of himself in order to worship this spirit. Who could do all these things? They have to go cut down a tree or find a rock. They have to chisel at it and kind of make it look like baal. They have to prop it up. Right. If it falls over, BAAL can't pick himself back up. They have to pick up, pick up baal. Right. So there's all these basic tasks. He can't feed himself, he can't dress himself. All these basic tasks that they have to perform for the idol. Why on earth would they think that he has power over rain and crops and human fertility? Like that dog don't hunt. Right. Whereas the God of Israel created the universe and created the trees and created the rocks and created all of those things. And that's how, you know, he has the power to do the things that we ask of him."}

And like, you know, the whole thing about, like, look, you, you cut down the tree and made this idol. You, you know, you know, you smelted this and you made it this idol is essentially to say, like, like, look, you in some ways are more powerful than this God. Like, why are you asking it for help? You know? And then on the other side, Yahweh, the God of Israel, is described as not only that he created everything and rules everything, which no pagan God claims that about himself, they don't even make that claim. But also that he takes no bribe, meaning he doesn't need anything. You can't pay him off. And that's one of the reasons that he's completely different from the gods of the nations. And I would also ask, why would humanity ever come up with a God like that? Because a God that you can't manipulate is not advantageous to you. So these people who say that the God of the scriptures is made up to control other people or something like that are just terrible theologians. They have no sense of the way that that worship and theology actually work. So. Yeah. Does that make sense?"}

But a demon could come and give thoughts and through giving those thoughts, convince someone to commit some atrocity. But even there, the agency is human agency. It's a human who has to go and commit the atrocity, just like it's a human who has to go and make the idol. These are all things that the demons are manipulating people into doing toward their own destruction. So it's just a negation of who God is and what God does. They're not powerful in the sense that they certainly can't oppose God about anything, really, but they also can't do anything to you. Right. Like physically Unless you've entered into some kind of thing. Right. Unless you voluntarily become party to something."}

And I mean, and if that seems like, I don't know, unbelievable, whatever, I mean, humans can do this too. Like, you know, think of any murderous dictator, no matter how big and powerful that particular guy was. The reason why his. His power over people worked is because they. They gave that. That power to him. You know, they went along with what he said. He was able to manipulate and control them through. Through that influence, not because he was out there, you know, doing all that bad stuff directly himself. Right. It takes, you know, an army or whatever to make that stuff happen.

So the materialist says the demons have no power because they don't exist. The pagan says the demons have all these kinds of power that they don't have. And you're correcting the record to say that a demon has power in the sense it has reality, obviously, and then it has power in the sense that it can influence our thoughts, which is a significant power once we, God forbid, actualize that.

And then related to that, it seems like a trope that, you know, we refer to so and so but don't use their name. And then the question directly about Frankenstein's monster is, if he did have a name, would he have been less monstrous, perhaps, maybe more integrated? Related to that, we oftentimes pray for help from a guardian angel, often unnamed, and then, I guess, more materially. In modern psychology, we're often led to name our problems specifically so that we can confront them. All that to say, how does naming or not naming something affect how we relate to the world, both seen and unseen?"}

I mean, I think, like, I'll speak from a literary point of view, since this is literally something I have expertise in. I mean, I think in the book, the way that the namelessness of the monster functions is that. I mean, there's probably whole papers that have been written on this. I have not written a paper on this. But is that it becomes this possibility for displacement for everybody in the story, that everything, whatever their desire is, can be sort of put on this thing, and it belongs to them on some level, whether it's something good or something bad. They might be horrified by it, which obviously a lot of people in the story are, but it makes it so that there's nothing. It's not, you know, it's not controllable. It's not tamable. You know, and the fact that it's an amalgamation from a lot of different bodies, I think feeds into all of that as well. Right. You know, so that it's this, in some ways, an ultimate hybrid, but it's a hybrid of humans. Right. You know, just sticking parts together. So, yeah, I mean, it's. It's a. Quite frankly, I think it's a really interesting book for this moment in Western history to think about what it means in terms of humanity and all of that. So, yeah, I mean, that's. That's some of what I would say in terms of what it's doing as a story for Father. I mean, what is the place of naming with the monstrous?"}

But all signs seem to point in the direction of that he did indeed belong to that body and was never actually in communion in the canonical sense with the Orthodox Church in his life. I'll give you another example. Now this one was short lived, so it doesn't super count as an example, but it's kind of an example in the sense that the way that the people of the time thought about it was clearly different than the way that it tends to be talked thought about now, which is there was a period where one of the metropolises in Greece venerated Thomas Aquinas and actually had a feast day and hymns and the whole nine yards. Now it didn't."}

I feel like maybe it's a little bit of a silly question, but I was just getting my nails done at the salon as maybe you don't know what that experience is like, but I just noticed that with salons and, you know, any kind of, like, even fashion nowadays, like, there's so much of that New Age influence, and I'm wondering that if, you know, if there's any danger in kind of even passively participating. Like, for example, today, you know, where I had my hands while she was working on my nails, there was like crystals hanging and a dream catcher and all this stuff. And I've been to hair salons before where the stylist is wearing an apron that has like a tarot card motif. And it's just like. I don't know if it's just my anxiety, but part of me worries that, you know, even by kind of being exposed to that or whatever, that could be harmful in some way. But I'm just curious about your thoughts on it. Like, do you have to really intentionally be interacting with things like that to have a negative influence? Or is there harm in just kind of possibly being around that stuff?"}

Yeah, you do need to have. There needs to be some kind of intentionality. Although, like, to me, it's an. It's an opportunity to be subversive. Like, you could be in there and, like, praying the Jesus prayer quietly, whatever. And then people like, wait, why isn't my demon stuff working? You know, so you can, like, turn the lights out on them, so to speak, by doing that. I mean, that's real. That is a real thing. Like, there's a story. I mean, so there's a book called Orthodoxy and the Religion of the Future, which by Father Seraphim Rose. There's some things about it I like. There's some things about it that I think needs some work. I know there's a lot of people are going to hate the fact that I said that at all, but there is a fun story in there, Father Andrew. Yeah, exactly. Now you can send Hate mail to me because it's me. But, but. But there's a fun story in there where he. He recounts how there was some group of, I think, tourists who were in India and they were going to go sort of watch an Indian. I don't know how to pronounce this correctly. Fakir. I don't think it's faker anyway. I don't know, do like some kind of spiritual show. I don't know, some kind of effect, whatever. And there was a priest. There was an orthodox priest in the group. And he. He went. And while this fakir was like, making some kind of illusion in front of everybody, the priest suddenly realized, like, what am I even doing here? And he started praying the Jesus prayer. And then it disrupted the whole thing. And then the fakir looked at him like, you horrible, horrible man. You know, Even though I was just like, internally, he was just praying, you know, So, I mean, that kind of stuff is real. I mean, my. I don't know, my thought is, like, okay, are you going there for that stuff? Like, is that what you're focusing on? You know, if it is, then, yes, you have a problem. But if it's just like, oh, you know, my hairdresser has this goofy whatever, you know. Yeah, yeah. It's not magic, you know."}

I mean, it is a thing, right? But ultimately, like we were saying to our caller who was asking about imprecatory prayer, who was hoping to bring more evil upon those who are glorious upon the earth, the righteous anger should really be directed at our sins. And I mean, often we have some sense of that. And it's not perfect, but, like, you have a sense of like, okay, there I go again, kind of thing. Right. Which is sort of the beginning of that idea. But it takes. I mean, it takes practice to do this correctly. Most of us, we're going to only ever do it imperfectly. And I think it's like, if someone feels a sense of anger at someone else being harmed, there's nothing wrong with that. The question is, what do you do with that? Like, if you then hate the person doing the harm, then you have a problem. Okay, right. But. But to feel a sense of. Of anger and want to destroy that from happening, that's. I mean, that's good.

So my first question, my main question is about the paradise. So in previous episode, in the first part of this show, you talked about the paradise, and you mentioned that it was basically this garden, this place of presence, which was the perfect, let's say, mix of order and life. And it was also like a temple where the first humans were placed. And they had to work in this. In this garden that God made for them. And they basically had to expand it so that the whole. That paradise would encompass the whole earth. But because of their sin, their transgression, they were expelled from paradise, as we know."}

They were expelled in this present world where there is death and suffering and all that. But on the other hand, some episodes ago, I don't remember exactly when, he also said that what is basically in this world, what is outside the paradise, the chaos of this world. So earthquakes, hurricanes, and all of that are not inherently evil or bad in itself, but they are bad for us because we are sinners. And through our sin, we are mortal, we are corruptible. So it is our sinfulness that makes all these natural manifestations bad for us. So which is it? Do we need to expand the paradise to tame, let's say, the entire world? Or will. Will the life in the age to come have these. These natural, let's say, manifestations, but they won't be a problem for us anymore."}

I mean, my. My first thought is, goes to where in the revelation of St. John, it talks about the sea being like Glass, which suggests to me that the creation is finally at rest in a way that it's not in this life. I don't know. Father, what do you think? Am I tracking the right direction there?"}

So there's bacteria that help us live, right? If the bacteria. If all the bacteria in our guts die, we die because we can't digest food. But at the same time, we get the wrong kind of bacteria in the wrong place, it can get us sick and kill us. So just like I think in the world to come, I see no reason why I would say that in the world to come there won't be any snakes. Like rattlesnakes will just cease to exist. Rather, I would say, well, they're not going to bite people and poison them and kill them, right? Or lions or tigers or, you know, hippos aren't going to exist, I think. I wouldn't say for sure they're not going to exist. We don't know exactly how that'll work with animals in the age to come. Of course, there's a mystery to it, but I don't see any reason why they wouldn't exist. They just wouldn't harm humans, right? Because those are the images we get, like in Isaiah, right? Of the little kid reaching into the asps thing and not getting bitten. Right? And I wouldn't say there aren't going to be any bacteria in the world to come, right? I don't know. Again, exactly. I'm not saying biological processes will all be the same in the life of the world to come. We don't know. But I don't see any reason why there couldn't be bacteria. Those bacteria just won't be harmful to us."}

But I didn't know that about that there. What I was bringing up though, that led me to talk about like, okay, well they're connected to the ever people biblically, if anything. And in general people. Let's say a buddy of mine I talked to, he's more secular about the Bible. And when. When I tell him everything that I. Everything in the Bible actually happened, sometimes that causes an issue because when I say actually I'm not very being very specific on like, like if they. I've never had a problem with the 4000 BC timeline of. Of the biblical life because secular science shows something happened then. And then all of every. All of history we can find literally starts to. So it made me think about Adam and how that all works out. And then I was just wondering if you guys ever come across any work where Adam's age is seen as generations versus anything else. So 900. What I did was some bad math. 900 years or 930 years for Adam times 70 for an average lifespan came out to about 63, 000 years or 65. Modern science from what I can tell says that the greatest leave from Africa happens to be about 50 to 70,000 years ago. And with the fact that Eden is potentially in Africa, that's. I just wanted to know if there's any thoughts you guys have from that or if you guys ever come across a longer gist of somebody really trying to say something about any of that."}

That it's not just literally saying this person lived for this many years. Right. That the numbers have a greater significance than that they're reflecting something else. But that's a code that we haven't really cracked yet. I say that because there's in the Sumerian kings list. The Sumerian kings list lists the kings before the flood and then after the flood. And a lot like In Genesis, before the flood, they have these really long lifespans, and then after the flood, they have much shorter lifespans and before the end. And people think that, like somebody living 939 or 50, 969 years is crazy. Like there are people who live thousands of years on the Sumerian kings list."}

And once you realize they were working with base 60 instead of base 10, that worked out. Base 60 basically means that your basic unit for measurement and mathematics is 60.

This is one of the things that's left over from that old Babylonian base 60 math. Now, that said they've tried base 60 math with Genesis, it doesn't work out. So we're still not sure, but there's hints. So like enoch is the seventh from Adam in the Genesis genealogy. St. Jude points that out in the New Testament. He says, enoch the seventh from Adam. And if you go to the seventh person in the Sumerian kings list, the seventh person in the Sumerian kings list created the solar calendar of 365 days. And if you go look at Enoch in Genesis, it says he lived 365 years. So there's these hints that there's this kind of code happening in Genesis."}

And I don't just mean Hebrew, but the way that it communicates is not the way that we communicate, you know, so. So that's part of the problem is, is when we take a modern sensibility and try to put it on ancient, ancient texts, and we want it to, like, line up according to our understanding. And if it doesn't line up according to our modern understanding, then we say, well, that didn't happen, or it's not true. The way in which it's true and the way in which it happened is being communicated in ways that we no longer use. And so that's part of, you know, frankly, that's a lot of what we're trying to do on the show is to recover, as much as we can, some of those sensibilities, you know, from. From the past. We can't, you know, we can't flip a switch and think like a, you know, someone from 2000 BC.

Thanks for having me on. My question is, on my way to work every day I pass two. They call them botanica shops, but they're Afro Caribbean witch doctor huts, storefronts, and they've got all the candles with icons of saints on them and big icons of the Theotokos on their windows. And they do all sorts of rituals in there and they sell all sorts of witch doctor stuff. And I'm wondering why the saints put up with their images being used in the syncretic way to worship West African gods, like the Yoruba gods, why they don't do something about that."}

But I mean, ultimately, it's the same reason that any of us are allowed to sin at all. Right, right. Is that. That out of love for us, God permits us to have free will.

That's what I'll talk about. I think it depends a lot on your, on a lot of factors in your life. Right? Like so, like if you're married and you have kids, what your daily prayer is going to look like as a priest is going to be different than if you don't. What if you're not married and if you don't have kids, you know, just because that's the reality. If, if you are married and you have kids, then your task is, among other things, to lead them in prayer, you know, you know, I'm, I'm not just like, I'm not just a priest, I'm the priest of my home. And I try, you know, I don't always succeed. Every morning, I'll be honest. And part of that is because I have to stay up late talking to the swamp ogre sometimes. But I try to get up every morning and pray morning prayers with my kids before the ones who go to school, before they go to school. Because they need to not just be told that this is what you're supposed to do. They need to be shown this is how you do it. Because Christianity is a whole lot of how to. But also I think that, you know, like in, like for instance in the, the, the, the again, you know, mutatis mutandis. Right. I'm not telling people they should be Anglicans, but I, I love and respect my Anglican friends. Absolutely. But I mean, you guys have a whole, you know, Book of Common Prayer tradition, which has a whole set of things that you should be doing every day. Right. I don't know if there's like specific commandments to priests about, you know, using the office or whatever, but at least what I know of it is that like I wouldn't personally find it objectionable. I mean most of it's just psalms and stuff. And I mean that's perfectly, absolutely great. So you know, I mean, I think especially for. For priests who are serving in parishes or have any kind of, you know, active life where they're not living in a monastery or something like that, just to set up some kind of discipline that you can always do and be ready to make adjustments as needed for the other humans that are in your life, because, you know, you're ultimately there to serve them and not to say, no, this is my rule. You know, that's. That's been my experience, is I've had to learn to be merciful both to the people around me and sometimes to myself, when my idea of what Christianity is is about following a specific rule. That said, I mean, discipline is really important, but discipline has an object and it's not itself. You know, the point of being disciplined is not to be disciplined. The point of being disciplined is to love God and to love your neighbor. You know, So, I mean, that's what I would say about that. I don't know. Father, do you want to do some imprecatory psalms or something right now or."}

At the baptism of Christ, the Holy Spirit alighting on him, he's not coming at that point in the way that he does on Pentecost. I mean, that's pretty clear, right? So obviously Christ is referring to that. He's referring to Pentecost, not to some kind of presence of the Holy Spirit, which obviously the Holy Spirit's been present in one way or another for the whole history of humanity, but not being poured out in the way that he's poured out on Pentecost. I don't know, Father. I mean, I could speculate here. I mean, he certainly. He talks about sending the Spirit and so forth, but what's going on in terms of the sort of sequence of events.

Right? Because Christ will have finished his work, his work of atonement, his work of recreation, and he'll be enthroned, just as God was enthroned on the seventh day of creation. And that then opens the way for the Holy Spirit to be poured forth on all flesh. So what he's saying in St. John's gospel is I need to go and be enthroned. Right? We need to move into this next phase. I can't stay with you the way I am here with you now forever, right? That would not be good.

And so in, in the Greek, does it sound like it? Because when I read it in the translation, it seems like it. When he's saying that it's an either or proposition. Like you either get Jesus and maybe not.

And St. John's goes, this is right before he's arrested. I'm going to die. I'm going to go away. You're sad. You shouldn't be sad. Because when I go away, when I go and I am enthroned, when I complete this work that's here among you, right, then this new phase begins. Then the messianic age begins, right?

So I'm a Roman Catholic, but I love the Orthodox Church. My father converted to Greek Orthodoxy. You know, I'm not a theologian or do I have to be? I'm just a layperson. And my priority should be the salvation of my family soul and my soul. So with that as a priority, you know, I need truth, and I find it in the Orthodox Church and I find it in the pre conciliar Catholic Church. I believe both are part of the, you know, basically the same church, and that the sacraments are valid in both, you know, the Novus ordo it's, you know, obviously very corrupted by Protestantism, and there are many devotions and Marian apparitions that are clearly fake that, you know, the current church, you know, says it's worthy of belief, although we don't have to believe in private revelation. I only believe that three Marian apparitions are real. Again, albeit we don't need to believe in private revelation. But one of those three is the apparitions and the messages of Fatima. And as a response to something I heard, I think, Father Stephen say on a previous podcast about that, about the errors of Russia and Russia will be converted. The message itself is really profound. Once you really get into the roots of Bolshevism and how it's very much still alive and well in the world today under a different name or an unnamed title. But the errors are here and they have spread. But when the Blessed Virgin Mary said, russia will be converted, he didn't say Russia would be converted to Catholicism. He just said Russia would be converted. I personally see that Russia was converted. Russia was converted to. My goodness, they were under, you know, communism. It was terrible. And then to see the revival of the Orthodox Church in Russia was. I mean, it gives me goosebumps to think about it. I mean, I don't understand why. I mean, am I wrong to feel that way? No one else, you know, Catholic or otherwise, seemed to feel that Russia was converted, although they clearly are. You know, I don't know. So I guess I'm asking. It's not a question, but asking for your thoughts on how I feel about help. Both sacraments are valid in both churches. And, you know, I don't know, just thinking, maybe put some thought into. Was Russia converted? Russia did convert to Orthodox Christianity."}

Well, let me say a couple things before you go, before you just put your big foot in full in the thumbs up. I mean, number one, okay, so converting to Orthodox Christianity, in terms of Russian history, I mean, that happens a thousand years ago, Right, Right. So, you know, I mean, it begins a thousand years ago, really. I should say it begins a thousand years ago. So it's not like there was this 20th century event, you know, where Russia converted to Orthodox Christianity. It is true that there has been revival in the sense of. I mean, certainly many, many, many churches have been built or rebuilt. You know, monasteries have been re. Have been revived. Many, many people have gotten baptized. Like, a lot of this stuff has happened in the wake of the Fall of the Soviet Union. That said, and I haven't looked this up in a little while, but, like, other indicators, like, for instance, just attending church, it is a very low percentage right now in Russia. Like, it's. It's in the single digits. Last I checked. So many. Many people baptize, and then that's kind of like, in many cases, the last time they go to church or, you know, just once in a very great while. So, like, is it a Christian nation? I mean, I know people who will absolutely, like, they'll wave flags and so forth, but, like, I don't know. It's kind of a problematic moment to ask, is Russia converted to Orthodox Christianity in that sense? But I. I don't. I'll just say this. I don't think that that's the most important question, honestly. Right. I mean, number one, I have zero investment in whether or not the. The stuff coming out of Fatima is true or not. Like, it doesn't matter to me. You know, I have nothing that hangs on that because I'm not a Roman Catholic. So, you know, the idea that Russia is consecrated to the Immaculate Heart of Mary, which is, you know, central to that particular piece of it, would probably sound really deeply weird to most Russians, including the most pious ones, you know, they were probably like, what is that all about? We don't have a devotion to the Immaculate Heart of Mary, you know, like, that's not part of their religious world. It's just not, you know. You know. So to me, the question is not did it, you know, like, the. The. It's not a. This idea of a Christian nation, I think, is problematic by itself. That's. That's the point that I'm trying to make. And I also think, honestly and with the utmost respect to my Russian Orthodox friends, and I have plenty of them, I think that the ones who take a serious, sober look at Russia would not say that it is a place that is, you know, that is anywhere near as pious as it could be. You know, that's just the reality."}

So, you know, to me, it's, you know, it's like, well, so who is actually following Christ? That's the question. Who's actually following Christ? And it's clear to me, that some Russians are. And that some Russians are definitely not, you know. So in any event, I do know. I mean, like, what Father Stephen said about the idea that, you know, Russia would be converted to Catholicism. It's true that that is not in the wording of. Of what was said by Sister Lucia or Lucha or however you're supposed to be pronounced. I don't know. You know, it's the idea that Russia will be converted and, you know, not necessarily will be converted to Roman Catholicism, but a lot of people have interpreted it that way, you know, and. But again, like, this idea of being consecrated to her immaculate Heart, I don't know where you would find that in Russia except amongst the little handful of, you know, the small handful of Russians who are Catholics who might have that devotion. But most Russians absolutely would not. Absolutely would not. It's just foreign to Orthodox, you know, piety. So, yeah, I don't know. I mean, again, I have nothing hanging on whether those things are actually real prophecies or not. And I do know also that Fatima is very controversial within the Roman Catholic Church, you know, so y' all have to work that out."}

I mean, Americans actually go to church way more than Russians do. That is definitely known, for sure. Americans go to church way more than Russians do. In terms of church attendance, the most Orthodox country in the world, from the best my understanding, is Romania. Romania is the most Orthodox country in the world where I think church attendance is like, in the 40% for weekly attendance. I mean, that's pretty good. Obviously. I Wish it was 100%, but in terms of comparative churchgoing, that's fairly good. But. Yeah. Anyway. Okay, Father Stephen, I know you wanted to just to say something or whatever, offend everyone."}

It's not. It's not in the word of hat of it, but as you mentioned, lots of people interpret it that way.

And this gets to a bigger thing in terms of your call in general. Right. That I'll reiterate, I say, But I don't say it enough because I know the last time we did a call in and we got a call about Roman Catholicism and what's keeping us from getting back together. And my answer, like, ticked off a lot of our Roman Catholic listeners. And I don't apologize for it because I don't think I said anything that wasn't true. In fact, I think the fact that a lot of what I said was true is what ticked them off. Because even you've made some comments in your call about dissatisfaction with the Novus Ordo and stuff. That's basically the stuff I was talking about."}

Right? So when there are ideas that people are using on themselves or that other people are using on them that are hurting them or making it more difficult for them to find salvation, those kind of things, those are the ideas that I want to attack. Exhibit A is why I go after Calvinism so much. As I've said before publicly. Right. I grew up around Calvinists in a Dutch community. I've been with them while they're dying. I've seen what it does to them and their sense of spirituality and lack of assurance and all kinds of things that have gotten twisted up. Right. And so that's why I go after those ideas. Now, if you're a Presbyterian and you're happy and well adjusted and being faithful to God and stuff."}

Don't get offended by me critiquing those ideas. If those aren't ideas that you hold. Right. If you hold to some different version of Calvinism or some different version of the thing that I'm not criticizing, then I'm not criticizing it. Right. And so the same is true when I'm saying something critical of Roman Catholicism. I'm in a situation right now where Lafayette, Louisiana is, where I'm a priest, is hypothetically 70% Roman Catholic. Now, much like Father Andrew described in Russia, you are not going to find like 120,000 people in mass every week here. That's not a thing that's going to happen. They were baptized Roman Catholic at some point. But the Roman Catholic Church here in southern Louisiana is deeply embedded in the cultural life and city life and political life. And so I see with the local archbishops, of the local clergy, the way they interact with their people, the way traditional things are shut down in parishes here, and other things that are not so great are promoted here by the bishop and things. Right. When I see those things happening, that. That inspires me to want to go after those bad ideas."}

These people are suffering for various reasons, and I want them to draw closer to Christ. And so I'm going to go after those bad ideas and try to present them some better ideas of how we do things here at my little parish in Lafayette. Right.

I will never forget during COVID when everyone was shutting down, including my father's Greek Orthodox parish, the SSPX stayed open, and the Father prior was saying, if only everyone would be as concerned about the health of their souls as they are concerned about the health of their bodies right now. You know, we're freaking out over Covid and churches closing down and people not going to church. And, like, that's what I love to hear. Meanwhile, you know, and then there's.

You know, from a Roman Catholic point of view, officially the official Roman Catholic point of view, the Orthodox Church has everything needed for salvation, and the Roman Catholic Church has everything needed for salvation. Right. So from the official magisterial Roman Catholic point of view, you can be saved as an Orthodox Christian. And from the Orthodox point of view, we would not put it that way.

He said if you had, or maybe, maybe you put the scenario out there. He put it out there to you, but you said if you had an Eastern Orthodox couple who was going to circumcise their son, and one of them was Jewish, so the mother's Jewish, you would ask them, why. Why are you going to do that? And so my more general question is, you said there's a difference between this is how I become a child of Abraham is through circumcision versus we know it's from faith, something to that effect. Was that right?"}

So my question is really, when you are a child of Abraham via the flesh, so to speak, like, as in you are Jewish, like my, like, my daughters are Jewish according to, like, Jewish law, my son will be Jewish according to Jewish law whether he gets circumcised or not. Right, but so with these things that were given to Abraham, like, every male in your household will be circumcised."}

Culturally. Yes. Yeah. No, I have not. I have not. No, no, I'm not Jewish. I'm. Yeah, yeah. So I was never a thing. Yeah, no. So that's the more general question. As, as, as, you know, I say as a Jewish person, which I'm not. But, you know, like, if you're, if you have, you know, Jewish children, Jewish wife, or if you're, you know, a Jewish person coming into Eastern Orthodoxy, I'm trying, I guess I'm trying to get a definitive answer. So it's, it's like. And I realize it's a hard topic because. And you've talked about, if we ended up having a bunch of people who are Jewish convert Eastern Orthodoxy, you might be able to have a Jewish Orthodox Church."}

Was the individual, which would be awesome. Right. But so, so I, we real. Looks like we know that you are a child of Abraham through faith, through the faithfulness of Abraham, but if you also happen to be a child of Abraham via, like you're Jewish, like for those things in the Bible, let's say this Were this will be a perpetual thing throughout all your generations. Or like, for Abra. For. Even if you want to go pre Mosaic. So God says to Abraham, you're going to circumcise all the males in your household."}

Because that'll change. Like, a very observant Orthodox Jewish woman probably wouldn't have married a Christian. Right. Like in the first place. Right, right. So that'll change family expectations too. So in general, right. As I said on Pageau, and I know I'm not outing anybody, I'm not giving any names, but I know for a fact that there are Orthodox bishops in this country who have given parishioners who are in a situation similar to yours a blessing to observe a number of elements of Jewish tradition or Old Testament tradition, really more Old Testament tradition. Right. In their homes. So that is a thing that happens. Right. Part of the complication here too is the fact that you are not Jewish and you as the father have a particular role in the household."}

So, but in general, if you have Jewish, like if you were both Jewish, right, The whole family was Jewish and you had all become Orthodox Christians and the bishop gave him his blessing and it's not all Jewish. Like you're not celebrating Jewish holidays instead of the Orthodox Christian ones or anything. Right. But there's elements of. Right. Including stuff like not eating pork and those kind of things. Right. That would be, again, a more clear cut thing. So those things are good and fine when blessed by the bishop. That short list of things when, again, they're not done as sort of. This is the general and absolutized path of salvation. Right. When they're kept in the way that Greek people keep Greek Orthodox traditions and Syrian Orthodox people keep Syrian Orthodox traditions and Russian Orthodox people keep Russian Orthodox traditions. Because there are different traditions about how they fast, there are foods they don't eat. Right. There are different things like that in different Orthodox churches. And I don't see how Jewish Orthodox Christians doing something similar with Old Testament traditions is any different than that. Again, providing there's the blessing and everything there."}

No. Right. But part of their argument is that it was never that. Right. That it never was that. Not that something changed. Right. So for them, circumcision still does what circumcision always did, but that was never something for everybody in the world. That was never right. But so you find people like St. Augustine saying that anybody who comes into the Christian church, even if they're a Jewish person coming into the Christian church and tries to demand that people be circumcised, needs to get thrown out as a heretic. But the civil authorities should not outlaw circumcision, et cetera, et cetera, and those things and the practice of those things because they were given by God in the Torah in the Pentateuch.

I'm doing a seminary online program on the Council of Florence, and, you know, got to dive in a little bit in the debates on the Holy Spirit. And it's like, I did this, and I'm still not clear, but it seems as if for the Catholic Church, the Holy Spirit becomes almost the love between the Father and the Son and kind of dissolves as its own hypostasis, as you might say. It almost seems as if what I'm saying is maybe a simplification, but it's kind of the shorthand that I'm starting to see in various conversations, you know, with Catholics and Protestants, that the Holy Spirit becomes this, you know, love between. So how. How much of. And I mean, I guess the broader. The broader question of the Holy Spirit within the Orthodox Church, it seems as if. Because it's a mystery, you know, like, when we have the apophatic approach of, you know, not necessarily defining everything, there's just a lot of mystery about the Holy Spirit.

That's what I'm saying. So a lot of the criticisms that orthodox historically have had for Roman Catholic new mythology is by means of saying, well, you're saying this in your theology. That implies this, and that's a problem. Right. And certainly like the idea that the Spirit is kind of demoted by the filioque. I mean, that's one of Saint Photius arguments, essentially. And, I mean. And, you know, you mentioned Florence. I mean, Florence does explicitly say that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son ab Uno principio. As from one principle. Right. And that's a super problematic phrase for the Orthodox, because that. I mean, that does just. There's all kinds of problems. I mean, again, just read St. Photius about that. Essentially, he says, like, well, if there's something that the Father and the Son share, namely that the Spirit comes from them and that the Spirit doesn't have that, then how, you know, is the Spirit really on the same level as them? And, you know, the basic principle being that whatever you can say about God can be said about one person or about all three, but not about two, and that anything other than that is very problematic in terms of the equality of the Godhead. I mean, again, as Father said, though, like, if you ask a Roman Catholic theologian directly, are the three persons of the Holy Trinity equal, they would absolutely say yes. Absolutely. They would say yes. So a lot of the argument is over whether Catholic theology actually does that or not. And from the Orthodox point of view, we definitely see the filioque not just as uncanonical in that it was declared by one Episcopal see, but as heretical, really. I mean, there are ways to interpret it in an orthodox way, you know, proceeding from the Father through the Son, this kind of thing. But I definitely would regard the language from Florence as being heretical. Absolutely. That's definitely what I think. Take it away, Father. This is our last. We've got. It's interesting. We've had a lot of stuff about Roman Catholicism this evening. So."}

Well, okay, back up one step. So if you want to get the actual, like, orthodox doctrine of the Trinity, the Nicene doctrine of the Trinity, which, to be fair, Catechism of the Catholic Church, everything, all say that they agree with this. They then teach other things like the filioque that don't seem to agree with this, but they all affirm the nice seductive Trinity, specifically the monarchical Trinity. If you want to learn all about that, see the work of Dr. Bo Branson, who mostly goes by Doc Branson from his adventuring days. Nice as an archeologist and freedom fighter. But the. So there's the positive reference. Okay, that's great. But the filioque gets. Gets sort of added in there in response to a particular Aryan argument. So Aryans opposed the dicey doctor of the Trinity by saying, well, look, you're saying only God the Father is really ase. You're saying that only God the Father is sort of unoriginate because the Son is begotten and the Holy Spirit proceeds. They both find their origin in the Father. The Arians say, well, see, your subordination is just like us."}

But you basically say the same thing because the Arian says part of being God is being unoriginate. So they take the unique quality of the Father and say that if you don't have that, you're not really God. So it's a circular argument, right? They say only the Father is God. And you say, well, why? And they say, well, well, because you have to have the peculiar quality of the Father in order to be God. It's just a circular argument. But rather than responding and saying it's just a circular argument, there were those who in the west, the far Spain and parts of Italy argued."}

So see, he proceeds from the Sun. Also, the Spirit proceeds from the Sun. So see, the Son is also God, right? And literally it got added to the creed in order to sort of ward off this Aryan argument. Now, as it developed, right, you get first, like Saint Maximus the Confessor sort of tried to apologize for it. He apologized for a lot of Latin usages. And he said, well, they say proceed from the Father, said, but they just mean through the Son. He basically said, that's not what they mean. The people who are saying it mostly in the west don't know where it came from, don't know why it started. They just kind of mean that the Holy Spirit proceeds through the Son, meaning he proceeds from the Father, but then he's sent by the Son into the world. Something like that, right? That's what they really mean. And then you get the whole episode with them wanting the Pope to make that official. One Pope saying, no, I won't, then another Pope saying, yes, it is. And then the split and the Great Schism and everything happens. But so Saint Photius the Great, who Father Andrew mentioned, comes in and points out all the problems with it, right? Like, okay, so you added this phrase to try to ward off this one Aryan argument. But let's think about Some of the problems it causes. Okay, well, if the Son having a person proceed from him, makes him really God, then who proceeds from the Holy Spirit by that argument? Either the Holy Spirit isn't really God, or you have to add a fourth person, and then he left out a fifth."}

Right. Like. And none of them work. Right. And so I think, as you mentioned in your question, what you practically end up with in a lot of cases is the Holy Spirit being kind of subsidiary because they're not going to add a fourth. Right. So you end up with a view where he is kind of subsidiary. And so what Florence is trying to do then ultimately is trying to ward off a bunch of the criticisms of the filioque."}

Right. But so they come up with this language of like, well, proceed as from one principle. Right. What does that even mean? Yeah, right. And like, if you read the Catechism of the Catholic Church, it says they affirm the filioque in a way such that it does not deny the monarchy of the Father. Well, there's quasi quidum, like some certain way. Like what way? It seems to obviously deny the monarchy of the Father. Well, no, no, we believe it in a way that doesn't, like, love all the."}

But one of the tendencies in that text and in texts that follow to the west, like Bay Trinitate and stuff, and in the Western trinitarian tradition and is that it tends to relativize the persons. It tends to the same way that they'll say we tend towards tritheism. We would say their texts tend toward making the persons just relationships within God."}
