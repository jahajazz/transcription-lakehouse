The modern world doesn't acknowledge, but is nevertheless haunted by spirits, angels, demons and saints. In our time, many yearn to break free of the prison of a flat secular materialism, to see and to know reality as it truly is. What is this spiritual reality like? How do we engage with it? Well, how do we permeate everyday life with spiritual presence? Orthodox Christian priests Father Andrew Stephen Damick and Father Stephen DeYoung host.

Yes, well, so in many of our past episodes we have brought up various pagan deities including gods associated with thunder and lightning. BAAL and Zeus foremost among them, but with the occasional mention of good old Thor as well. But we've never focused directly on them to give a rounded out overview of who they are and how the people of God had reached and how the people of God have responded to them and even continued to tell their stories. So in this episode we're actually going to do that. We're going to move through these three basically chronologically in terms of how biblical and subsequent Christian history treat baal, Zeus and then Thor. So Father Stephen who exactly is this BAAL we hear so much about? Especially in the Old Testament. What does that name even mean?"}

And sayanna means master. Right. We call our bishops master. So it's that kind of sense. Right. So BAAL can just sort of function in that kind of way. And in the Old Testament, it's usually functioning in that kind of way when it's used in the plural Baals. Right. So you'll see, you know, Israel ran after the Baals. Right. The idea there is it's just being used to refer to sort of pagan deities in general. Yeah, right. Who are called various things, but that's using it more as a title. But there's also evidence from very early on. Right. So not only all of our Ugaritic evidence, like the BAAL cycle, so we're talking about the second millennium BC where this starts being used as a personal name. Right. In the same way that we're going to see L, which is just sort of the generic early Semitic word for God in general, gets used as a proper name for one particular pagan deity. BAAL starts to be used as a name for one particular pagan deity."}

The most closely allied isn't the right word, but the most closely derivative one is the God Hadad in Syria."}

But. And I'm going to pronounce this the southern way, when you see reading the Old Testament and you come upon Ben Hadad, that's the son of Hadad, the son of this deity who's the king in Syria. Right. So we know this is the one that's most closely allied because in the very early period, the very early Canaanite period, where BAAL is just starting to become a proper name for this deity, there is BAAL Hada is the way he's referred to in sort of very early, what would be now called Phoenician sources, sources in the Levant. Right. We find this BAAL Hada, who ends up just being referred to as BAAL by the Phoenicians and just being referred to as Hadad by the Syrians."}

Right. By his proper name. And then within that. Right, we've talked about the use of the word hypostasis to describe. And we're not going to go back into the discontinuities with the doctrine of the Trinity now, but the word hypostasis is used to describe the way in which. Right. Sometimes within these pagan sources, you have gods in different places that are treated as aspects or versions, hypostasis of the same God. And then there are other gods who are treated as different gods."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #050 - 2022-08-25 - Thunder Gods and the God Who Thundered","start":612.76,"end":616.04,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Yeah. And there's potentially infinite localizations."}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #050 - 2022-08-25 - Thunder Gods and the God Who Thundered","start":618.04,"end":694.83,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"And so the difference would be, for example, right, you have Artemis, the way she's depicted in Athens, which is as this huntress. And then you have Artemis, the way she's depicted in Ephesus, Right. With all the fruit hanging off of her. Right. Artemis of the Ephesians, the Ephesian Artemis. Those were seen as being the same goddess, but neither of them were seen as being the same goddess as Hera or Athena or. And, yeah, so it's not that sort of all the pagan gods just devolve back into hypostasis of one male and one female God. Right. It's that there's these variety of spirits and gods and then they appear in various forms or manifest themselves in various forms in different places and different cultures at different times. And so what you end up with is they would see, for example, BAAL and Hadad. And when we read about BAAL Paor. Right. Often you'll find a place name attached. The BAAL of this place. Right. These are all seen as hypotheses of the same God. Right. They didn't think that the BAAL of Peor and the BAAL of Tyre were two different spirits."}

And this family tree does not branch a lot. So Baal's father is El, which is. We were just mentioning that's just the word for God. Right."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #050 - 2022-08-25 - Thunder Gods and the God Who Thundered","start":730.87,"end":732.35,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"So Semitic word for God."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #050 - 2022-08-25 - Thunder Gods and the God Who Thundered","start":733.17,"end":751.01,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"So there's God and Lord. Right, to be used as proper names here. Essentially God and his son, Lord. But then BAAL also has a sister named Anat, who we've talked about a few Times before.

And so this is. This is the text. This is, of course, on tablets, Ugaritic, even though it's a Semitic language that's very close to Hebrew, was written in cuneiform. So this is on tablets, in cuneiform. And as we're going to see in a minute, not totally undamaged, it's not totally intact."}

Isn't totally clear. And we've talked about all three of these parts at various times on the show before, but just kind of go through them again. Again, because this time we're focusing in on BAAL and then sort of where those different BAAL traditions are going to go when we get into Greek and even later European sources. The first part is sort of about Baal's insurrection. Right. And this is. BAAL and his dad are not the bosses, Right. They're part of this big council of gods. And the people currently in charge are Yam. The sea is representing sort of chaos, and Nahar, which means river. Right. So there's King Yam and Prince Nahar. Right. And Yam is sort of the most high God who's in charge. And then Nahar is his sort of son, who's the one who Presides over the Council of the Gods."}

Leviathan, Lotan, water dragons, who he's going to end up siccing on BAAL during this insurrection and that kind of thing. But so these are sort of not only the previous people in charge, but these are forces of chaos. Excuse me, chaos and destruction. Right. So BAAL tries to start this insurrection. He's trying to fire up, you know, all the other gods to go and help him in his revolution. And these messengers, the word's literally the same word as angel, it's Moloch."}

When we were talking about the Tower of Babel and we talked about how just anthropologically. Right. When you study the origins of religion, you see sort of a primitive monotheism, what we would call primitive monotheism. The idea of there being one kind of major, central, most high divine figure in addition to other spirits, but who is over the top that.

So all of those ideas sort of surround Mote, and so that's why that sterility element is sort of directly opposed to Baal's sort of fertility element in a way that might.

So a few other places where we see our pal BAAL show up in the Old Testament, we mentioned, and we talked not that long ago on the show about BAAL Paor or BAAL Paor, the BAAL of Paor, the high place where Balaam helped instigate the priestesses, shall we say, of that high place, to seduce men of Israel into participating in these fertility rituals related to BAAL that resulted in a plague falling upon the people, that resulted in Phinehas becoming the high priest by putting an end to it.

If you go by the archaeological record of the ancient Near East, Omri is the greatest king, Israel, either the Northern Kingdom or the United Kingdom ever had. He expanded the territory the most. He was the richest, he was the most involved in trade. He established Samaria as the capital of the Northern Kingdom. And so part of that, they called Israel the House of Omri. All the neighbors, right. They didn't call it the House of David. They called it the House of Omri pretty much until it got wiped out by the Assyrians. So Omri was this very important king. His son is Ahab. Right. And so part of his wheeling and dealing and deal making and international trade and all that was marrying his son to the daughter of the king of Sidon.

A lot of it's philological, which is, you know, they sort of reconstruct Proto Indo European linguistic roots by looking at modern languages and kind of working backwards from there with a whole lot of. You know, if you look at linguistic texts, folks, you'll see little asterisks sometimes in front of roots and stuff. And that means that we don't actually know that that root existed, but it's our best guess based on where those languages are. Went. And so, you know, like you said, there's not a lot of written sources because writing just isn't around in that period. And so a lot of it is pretty good conjecture from working backwards, you know, from. From later instantiations of things. But again, it's conjecture. We don't really know. Right. We're just kind of making a guess based on. Okay. Like we see all these civilizations that are kind of outgrowths of Indo European civilization that seem, for instance, to have the idea that cows are sacred. And so we work back from there. And oh, by the way, look, here's an archaeological dig that has a bull's head in it. So, okay, maybe they worship some kind of bull deity, you know, that's the idea. That's how it goes."}

It's because they came from the Mediterranean. They came from the sea in boats. Right. And we don't know where all of the sea peoples came from, but we know several of the groups were from Crete, which means Philistines are also Cretans and other Greek islands. Right. And other places in that area and migrated south and they attempted to invade Egypt. That didn't go so swell. And they ended up settling along the coast of the Levant. And that's where the Philistines come from. That's most likely where the tribe of Dan comes from. They get assimilated, but like the tribe of Dan that gets partially assimilated, I guess they stay kind of pagan. What happens over time, we see this with the Philistines archaeologically, the very earliest tier of, like, their pottery and their crafts and that kind of thing is. Looks Mycenaean. Right. It's like, confirmatory of their origins."}

And so, but then over the centuries, as they're living in the ancient near east, their pottery patterns and methods change. These things change and shift to sort of mirror their neighbors. Right. So they kind of assimilate into the ancient Near Eastern culture, the Canaanite culture, over time. And part of how that happens is that the place where places where we found their oldest stuff is often in temples to their gods. They will have these, like, Mycenaean pottery pieces and, you know, chariot pins made out of bronze. Things made out of bronze that they can't. They can't get bronze anymore. Right. But so it's just.

That's the diction cave that goes all the way back to Minoan civilization and was a shrine. Right. As Zeus's birthplace. Later on, at different periods in history, Mount Ida and Mount Again also claim to have caves that they claim are the place where Zeus was either born or hidden from his father. We'll get back to that in a second. So there are sort of in what comes to be Zeus. Right. As he's. As this spirit is perceived in classical Greek culture, there are actually three elements that get assimilated together. So we've talked about a couple. One is that sky God figure. Right. That sort of fatherly sky God, most high God figure. One of those is the storm God or the thunder God. Right. Who is the son of Kronos. Right. And then the third part is. And this is what's reflected in the birthplaces and in the caves and in the particular locations. An actual human king and founder figure within Minoan civilization on Crete. And there are a few places here and there that actually refer to this classical sources. Right. That Zeus at some point had been human. Had been a human, this founder figure. So all three of those get assimilated together and it's that human king who the memory is kind of preserved of that causes Zeus to be depicted in the way he's generally depicted. Right. Meaning as a human or humanoid. Right. In sort of human form. He's sort of a old man's head on a ripped young guy's body."}

Even when BAAL is in sort of a humanoid form, he often has bull horns. Right. In depictions. So this is what causes him to be depicted in sort of this human way as this human king who he's kind of visually patterned after in most of our representations.

And so he turns this into three generations of gods where Kronos castrates Ouranos or Uranus. And then, you know, there's the whole story with Kros eating his children and, you know, gets fed a rock and Zeus gets hidden in the cave. Right. And so that very much depicts it as in Hesiod.

And so that's a very different picture than what Hesiod gives. Right. Because Hesiod is finding ways to incorporate these multiple traditions together. Right. So both of those traditions continue to exist separately despite that sort of stitching.

We know the connection between altar, footstool of the throne. We've talked about that before. Right. And the reason he can do that is that by the time St. John is writing at the end of the first century, sorry, Preteris, St. Irenaeus tells us when it was written, we know, Right.

{"episode_id":"LOS - #050 - 2022-08-25 - Thunder Gods and the God Who Thundered","start":6335.53,"end":6496.64,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Although. Well, yes, there is this Asatru thing, which I'm not even going to go into right now, but I will get to that. But. Because you can sometimes see, for instance, on the Internet, like, I just ran across a meme the other day which shows this picture of this Thor figure. He's got a, you know, a hammer over his. Over his shoulder, and it says, you know, your God was crucified on a cross, but mine has a hammer. Right. And so, like, that's the image that people have. And I think that's largely derived from seeing Thor as a kind of superhero in the comics especially, but especially the movies, is where a lot of people are counting a character named Thor. So we should set that stuff aside. So, as I said, almost everything that we know, quote unquote, about Thor and the Norse gods is from Christians, right? Now, before I get into that, someone is probably in the back of their head, is saying, well, what about Tacitus? What about Tacitus with Germania, you know, which is like first century, okay? So Tacitus, who is this Roman historian, he wrote this text called Germania. And most of it is actually not about the gods. Most of it's about. It's things that he has heard about the way the Germans live now. You know, Germans for him is not like the modern nation state of Germany. It's those barbarians living up somewhere a ways north of Italy and such. Right. That's what Germania is for him. It's that area. Now, he never went there. He never went there. He is compiling sources. He's apparently did talk to some people that went there. So we should not consider him to be a reliable source. And the other thing is that he interprets a lot of it in terms of Roman language and culture, which, I mean, that's totally understandable. Right. That's his perspective. But also the purpose of his text is actually to kind of critique Roman culture that was current to him at the time by kind of depicting this sort of noble savage that was the Germans, the Germanic tribes and like how sort of pure and primitive they were. And look at how corrupt and decadent we are, which, I mean, he was certainly right about that part, you know, and it was. The idea was like, you know, they're like we used to be back during the Roman Republic days, you know, that's kind of what he was trying to do with that text. So anyway, if you're going to read."}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #050 - 2022-08-25 - Thunder Gods and the God Who Thundered","start":6499.44,"end":6842.01,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Right, yeah. You know, and the thing is that between that and the sources that are normally pointed to as the Norse mythological sources, there are 13 centuries. That is a long, long time. So we shouldn't look at that text as being an accurate depiction of Norse religion. He, for instance, says that they worship Hercules, who might be a Thor figure at that point in Germanic history. Germanic pagan history, we really do not know. But he says, you know, it's said that Hercules visited them and they have this altar to Hercules. Actually he even mentions that they worship Ulysses. So it's interesting that he shows them as worshiping as gods, people that Romans and Greeks would have regarded as sort of superhuman heroes, you know, human heroes, but superhuman heroes, you know, maybe semi divine. Right. So I just wanted to get that whole Tacitus and Germania stuff out of the way. And the other thing I'll say about that is a lot of like, frankly, the Nazis and people who are into that kind of thing have read Tacitus Germania as sort of proof of the glory and the ancient purity of that people and have used it to very nefarious means. Tacitus would have no idea that that was going to happen with his text. I'm not saying people shouldn't read it. Just be aware if you do Decide you want to read it, that that's being used for that too. But anyway, I would not take it as a good source about Germanic religion or mythology or anything like that. There's some interesting stuff in there for sure, but it's not really where you're going to go if you want to understand the sources of Norse mythology. Okay, all that said, so all the actual written sources that we have about Norse mythology are from Christians and most of them are Icelandic. We're talking, you know, 13th, 14th century, a lot of it, mostly 13th century. Why is that the case? Why is it so late? Certainly weren't there people worshiping Odin and Thor and so on before all that? Yes. So for instance, we've got Saint Boniface in the 8th century, goes up there, chops down a sacred oak. There's references to him in his life, confronting Germanic pagans. But we have nothing from that period from pagans. Right. And if you read Saints Lives, they're not going to tell you a lot of details about pagan mythology and religion. They're just not there because it's not from that point of view. So that information is not there. Right. Why don't we have that kind of information? Well, the reason is that unlike the classical Greco Roman world, Northwestern Europe, which is where this stuff is happening, doesn't really write very much at all. We have a few, like, inscriptions on things, some bits scratched into rocks. We have helmets with people's names, you know, stuff like this. But this, the combined amount of text that we know that was written by Germanic slash Norse pagans is really. It probably could not even, you know, make up a paragraph or two total. Right. Like, that's the amount of actual writing we have from them. So that's why we don't have it. Writing, reading and writing in real literacy and manuscript production, all this kind of stuff comes into Northwestern Europe with Christianity. So we simply do not have sources. We do have some archaeological stuff, which again, you know, you find something that's buried down in a bog or whatever, it's not going to tell you much of a story. It's not going to really tell you much about religious practices. Right. Like, you know, imagine a church that's been buried for centuries, right. And you dig it up. Are you going to know how to celebrate the Divine Liturgy by doing that? No, you're not. Right. Even if you know that the Divine Liturgy was celebrated there, you're not just. It's not going to be there. You're not going to have that information. So what do they dig up in archaeology, well, they dig up sacrifices sometimes, so they find armor and weapons and stuff like that shoved down into bogs a lot of times. And occasionally they find sacrificial animals, but also sacrificial people, so often with their throats cut. So there is animal sacrifice going on. And the reason that we know that some of these places were sacrificial sites to gods like Thor is because of place names. So that's one of the ways that ancient ways of thinking about a place are preserved over time is place names. So you get, you know, we've talked about theophoric people names, right? People who have names that are connected to the names of gods or include the name of the God. You have theophoric place names as well. And often a theophoric place name means that that place was worshiped, that that deity was worshiped in that place, that there was a sacrificial cult going on there. Right. So, like, you know, you mentioned Father Athens, right. That's the place where Athena is worshiped. And so the city became named after her. So you've got a number of places. What's that?"}

From what we can tell, it's possible that the idea of Odin being above everybody else and worship the most is a later invention. So, you know."}

And I mentioned earlier about Asatru. Right. And heathenry. This kind of modern Norse neo paganism, it may well be that someone is successfully worshipping Thor. They're offering sacrifices to him and they're eating it. That is worshiping Thor. But if they say, I'm doing what my ancient Danish ancestors did. False. We do not know what your ancient ancestors did. We just don't know. So there might be. They're creating a new religion of Thor, but the old religion of Thor is gone.

They actually were real pagans, as the local Christians attested. So then they used the word Heavnu to refer to them. Right. So that's Heathen in Old English. So, okay, so what do we have in terms of actual sources? The biggest source that you're going to want to look at, if you want to look at the most authentic. Again, not authentic, but the most authentic representation of this mythology is written by a guy named Snorri Sturluson. So Snorri sturlson is a 13th century Icelandic politician, actually. He's the law speaker at one point, which is sort of like the head of the parliament, but also. And he gets involved in a lot of politics, actually, and he gets assassinated as a result of that. So he's a Christian. He does not seem to know Latin, but he knows people who knew Latin. And he has some idea about classical pagan sources. Right. Because he references in them and what he writes. The major book you're going to want to look at if you're going to look at the sources of Norse mythology is something called the prose Edda, E, D, D A. Sometimes it's just simply called edda. In Icelandic they call it snora edda, Snorri's Edda. And this book was written around the early 13th century, and it is not the equivalent of Edith Hamilton's mythology. He's not trying to put together a book of Norse myths. So that's disappointing to begin with."}

That's not his agenda. Right. He's trying to put together a textbook, and it's not a mythology textbook, it's a poetry textbook. So Snorri was, it seems, a pretty good poet, actually. And so he was really dedicated to a type of poetry called skaldic poetry. S K A L D I C Skaldic poetry. Skald is an old word for a Norse poet, and apparently it was falling out of fashion in his day, and so he wanted to revive it like, you know, other kinds of poetry had become hip and cool at the courts of the Scandinavians. And so he was trying to bring it back and he realized that a lot of people couldn't even write skaldic poetry because they just didn't have the capability. And so he puts together a textbook. And the purpose of this textbook is to give you the vocabulary that you need. Need to write skaldic poetry. Right. Well, why does he tell mythological stories in service to that purpose? It's because skaldic poetry includes lots and lots of allusions to Norse myths in order for it to actually just work. Right. So I'll give you an example. We talked about Sif Right. What is the color of Sif's hair? It is golden. It is always golden. It is nothing but golden. And that's because the phrase Sif's hair is used in skaldic poetry as a reference to gold. So, like, you know, it might say, and his hands flowed with Sif's hair. It doesn't mean that he got up next to the goddess and was grabbing her hair. It means that he had a lot of gold, that he was a wealthy guy. Right. So Scaldic poetry is full of that kind of stuff. It's everywhere."}

You won't get it. So for him, these stories are the classics, but they're kind of starting to get forgotten now. It should be said that at this point, we are about 200 years after Christianization in Scandinavia and in Iceland. None of these people who wrote this stuff down had ever met a Norse pagan because there simply weren't any left. They were gone. You know, Christianization had taken full hold. Right. So the two main parts of Snorri's Edda are the Gylfaginning, which is the beginning, and then the Skald scuppermal. So the Gylfiginning is a kind of Q and A between Odin in disguise as a king named Gylfie, who goes up to these three, I don't know, spiritual sages of a sort, and asks them a series of questions about the gods, about the beginning of the world, the end of the world, stuff like this. So it's a kind of cosmology is what kind of comes out of it. And from this you get a lot of the stories about, you know, Ragnarok and all this kind of stuff. And then the Skuld Scaparmal includes. There is a prose portion at the beginning, and then a lot of it is quoting some lines of poetry and then just explaining what specific references mean. So it's almost like a kind of thick glossary. Right. You can see how this book would not be great for just deriving a bunch of Norse mythology from. Because it's not made for that. At the beginning of it, he's got an introduction in which he. He depicts the origin of the Norse gods. And he says that they're heroes from the battle of Troy that come north and they're like great sorcerers or something, and they become worshiped as gods by the locals. So this is called Eu hamerization which is interpreting divine beings as actually being humans who then later get worshipped. Right. As their sort of legend grows. And you can see how that's. That connects like with what Tacitus does, where he says that, you know, in Germania they worship Ulysses, Right. And Hercules. And so he says that the, you know, that's the origin of things. But a lot of the things that we know of as Norse myths are all found in, especially the Gylfaginning, which is at the beginning. So, like you get Ragnarok, you get Odin with his brothers Vili and Ve, killing Ymir, the giant, primeval giant, and whose blood then fills the world and causes the flood. Right. That stuff is all there. Okay. And then he's got another significant work called the Heimskringla, which is the history of the kings of Norway. And at the beginning of it is called something called the Ingliga saga, which is the, you know, and in that he very explicitly makes the Aesir, ancestors of the kings of Norway and Sweden. So he's claiming that they have this sort of almost divine origin. But again, he says that the Aesir, the Norse gods, are humans. Right. That's. That's what."}

Another major source is the Poetic Edda. It is a 13th century collection from a manuscript called the Codex Regius, which don't get confused, there's more than one codex with that name. It means the Codex of the King because it was presented to one of the kings as a gift. It's a collection of songs and poems. It's generally thought that some of these might actually be authentically pagan texts. So maybe closer to the pagan sources. We don't know though, because once again, this collection was put together entirely by Christians. When it was found, it was called the Elder Edda because it was assumed that it was a lot older. But actually it's later than Snorri's Edda. But Snorri's Edda still gets called the Younger Edda in some sources. But it's just this collection of poems and. And interpolated within it. You actually have. I shouldn't say interpolated. We don't know. We don't know. You have comments, Christian comments every so often. Like, for instance, there's one that says this story comes from a time when ignorant people used to believe in reincarnation. So that's something that's in there. So you get Christian commentary. It is much harder to read unless you know the stories that are behind the poems. So I recommend that you read. If you can read this stuff, you read Snorri's work first, which tends to present the stories a little bit more coherently as narratives, because they're highly elusive. A lot of these might be hymns or like, folk songs that often assume you know the story. Right. I mean, we encounter that kind of stuff in text we talk about all the time. We don't know the rest because whoever heard this beginning at the beginning, knew the story, but, you know, no one bothered to write the whole thing down. Thanks. Ancient people, or if they did, we lost it. We just lost it. So I will also give an honorable mention to a text called the Gesta Danorum. It's the history of the Danes by a guy named Saxo Grammaticus. Grammaticus is a nickname that meant he was basically really good with Latin. His Latin is really, really good. It was written in Latin. It comes from the late 12th, early 13th century. It's basically history of the Danes from ancient prehistory up to the 12th century. It includes a very little amount of references to Norse mythology. Again, Saxo Grammaticus is a Christian, so he's not trying to represent Norse mythology, but he does engage in this EU Hamerization. Basically says that the Norse gods are people, they're humans that got worshipped later. And he says that they're the ancestors of the Danish kings. Another thing you'll see that's really interesting. And this kind of connects back to some of the themes that we talked about earlier, especially when we talked about Zeus. Is there's this connection back by a number of these Christian authors with classical mythology. We talked about Tacitus earlier, who's not a Christian, but Tacitus says they're worshipping Hercules up there. And if you went to a local Germanic tribesman and said, so you worship Hercules, I'm sure he would have no idea what you were talking about. But these authors connect some of the stories, and certainly the gods, back to classical gods. So like Snorri in one point says that Thor equals Jupiter, right? He doesn't use the word, the name Jupiter, but he kind of makes this reference. But another, he's not consistent with himself, by the way, everybody. At another point he says that Thor is Hector, and the way he gives it is. It's Hector. He's like this tor part, that's Thor. It's really bad etymology, but there you are. He lived long before the invention of modern philology. So Saxo Grammaticus says that Thor is equal to Jove, although he says some say that he's equal to Jove. He's not actually taking this position himself. Right. So there is this connect. There's this attempt to connect them back. And again, like I said, Snorri at the beginning says that the Aesir, the Norse gods, are heroes from Troy who come north and settle and rule and are worshiped later. Right. So there's this."}

And again, the word just means thunder. That's all it means. And when Norse people heard these stories, they would not have heard them as, oh, this is someone who has this name. And it's a different. Like, it would just be thunder. So for them, the difference between the thunder and what thunar is doing. Not a lot of space between those. Right. This is the thunder. Right. So Thor is also referred. Is also generally depicted as the son of Odin, who's actually Odin In Norse sources, Odinn. And here's where it starts to get weird. His mother is a goddess named Jord, and she's actually a giantess. So Thor is half giant, half Aesir. So you'll notice if you read Norse sources that giants are a pretty complicated set of beings. Whatever they are, they're probably not really tall. Some are depicted as hugely tall. I mean, Ymir, right, this giant that you construct the universe out of by killing him, he must be pretty big. But a lot of them are basically the same size as the ass here because they intermarry, right? So that's going on. And then some of them, you know, give birth to monsters and stuff. So what exactly are giants? It's not, it's not clear. But the giants of folklore that we often think about, the really tall giants, like everyone always asks us, like, you know, aren't giants really tall? That depiction of giants always being tall is a later kind of folklore thing. It does exist in legendary and mythological material, but it's not what it's about. That's not what makes them giants."}

As I mentioned, he seems to be the most worshiped God in Norway and Iceland. Based on archaeological stuff, he's depicted as red bearded. That's. That's a major thing. His great big red beard. Hair is red. Another thing. And see, this is something I don't think maybe you tell me if this ever shows up in the comics in the mythological sources. Norse has a whetstone sticking out of his skull that he got. He entered into a battle with the giant Hrungnir. And so Hrungnir prefer. His preferred weapon was this whetstone and he would throw it at people. And when it hit Thor in the skull, a fragment of it lodged in there and Thor tried to do something about it, but the, the seeress that he was working with got distracted. And so it is stuck in his head kind of permanently. Does that ever show up in the comics?"}

And not in the movies. I mean, hello. He should have a big rock sticking out of his head. Again, very disappointing. He's depicted as the sort of the big brute of the gods. He's super strong. He's not noble, he's not smart. None of these things you see in the modern Marvel depictions. Although lately they've kind of depicted him as a little bit dumber. But he's not. He's pretty dumb in the Norse sources, which may be a function of Christian's writing about this them. Right. You're not going to depict pagan gods as being these very wise, noble, admirable beings. They're going to be depicted as, you know, not admirable. Right. But he defends the gods against the giants, against the monsters. He's generally a big foe of the giants. Kills them almost anytime he sees them. He's the patron deity of farmers and sailors. Why would that be? Because he does the weather thing, and weather is super important to both farmers and sailors. He's the thunder God. He's the storm God. Right. So, yeah. Also very known for. For the hammer, Mjolnir. Also got a pair of iron gloves, a big belt of divine power. Makes him strong. Here's one of my favorite things about him. He owns a pair of goats, two goats, one named Tanjustr and another named Tan Grisnir. And these names mean Tooth Gnasher and Tooth Grinder. And here's what's great about them. So if he gets hungry, which Thor often is hungry, he can kill them and eat them. And if he lays the bones on their skins, when he wakes up in the morning, they're back. So he's got these magical reviving goats, reincarnated goats or whatever."}

So there's lots of stories about Thor in the sources. A lot of them are about him going on various adventures and killing giants, a lot of them. And a lot of those are pretty funny, actually. I'm going to mention one of those and then I'm going to tell you kind of the two big stories that are where Thor is involved. So here's the kind of fun one. So his hammer, Mjolnir, which is really important, obviously for the defense of the Aesir, gets stolen by a giant named Thrymr And Thrymir steals the hammer and says, I'll give it back if you guys send me Freya so that I can marry her. You know, she's one of the Aesir. She's one of the goddesses, right? And so there's a whole conversation amongst them about what. What they're going to do about this. And Freya, of course, hates the idea of having to go and be married to this giant. And so what they do is they just. I'm still laughing about this. They decide to dress up Thor in Freya's clothing, because that's going to be convincing, right? So he goes in drag and they're like, here is your bride. And when they sit down at the wedding feast, Hrymir notices that Thor is really putting it away. He has this divine level of appetite. And it's like, well, what's the deal? And Thor, as Freya says, or it might have been Loki, actually, I think, now that I think about who's nearby, anyways, they can. And they communicate like, well, you know, she's been fasting all this time to prepare for the wedding for you. And he's like, really? And sort of kind of pulls back the veil a little bit and sees these fiery eyes. And it's like, what's the deal with that? You know, like, oh, well, you know, she's been suffering so much from all the fasting, and so she's not feeling well. And so then finally they say, well, you know, where's the. Where's the dowry? Where's the bride price? And so they bring out Mjolnir and they hand the hammer to Thor. As soon as Thor gets his hammer back, he pulls off the women's clothing and proceeds to kill just about everybody present and walks away. And, you know, everybody is depicted as pretty ridiculous in this story, including Thor, especially Thor, which some scholars will say this is an indication that this was written really late and definitely under, maybe entirely composed by Christians. Like, again, we don't know which of these mythological stories were written by Christians. Whole cloth were adapted by Christians, were maybe possibly represented fairly authentically from the pagan period by Christians. We simply do not know. We don't know. This is what we've got, right? We can't say this is the original. We have no idea. Right? So, okay, so here's the two kind of big stories about Thor that I think are especially important for us, but are the ones you should. I think, if you can remember any, there's two. So one is the fishing expedition, and then the other is Thor at Ragnarok. So if you look at the Poetic Edda, and this is referenced in Snorri's Edda too. But if you look at the Poetic Edda, there is a poem called Himiskvida, which means Hymir's poem. So Hymir is a giant. He's kind of a frost giant, a wintry giant, and he's been staying with him and kind of eating him out of house and home, as Thor is wont to do. But the giant can't kill him because there's this whole hospitality thing. You don't kill people who are staying under your rock roof, even if you hate them and you are their mortal enemy. Like, this is not a thing you do that. Even the gods and giants are sort of bound by this rule. And so they decide to go fishing because Ymir is losing all of his food. While they're out there, Thor decides to rip off the head of one of Ymir's oxen. And he lowers his line down in the water with the ox head as bait and what should try to get hold of it, but the Midgard serpent itself, Jormungandr, the serpent that encircles the world, right? And if he starts moving his coils and there's earthquakes and it might be the end of the world kind of thing. So he drags the Midgard serpent up out of the water, and as he's got hold of it, he takes his hammer and he bashes it in the head. And in some versions of the story, that's the end of the Midgard serpent. But the kind of the main versions, it doesn't actually kill him, but when that happens, he mirror realizing what's going on and that actually Thor is threatening to cause the end of the world. He goes and he cuts the line that Thor has the Midgard serpent on, and then the serpent falls back into the water. And then Thor is so mad that he goes and punches Ymir about in the head. And in some sources, Hymir falls overboard and drowns. So that's the fishing expedition. This should probably remind us of references in the scripture to Leviathan. This is in Job, for instance, right? Leviathan being drawn up out of the water by a hook and tamed. Right? But this is the Norse version. So it's not about taming the serpent, it's about smashing him in the head. That's how it goes. So the other big thing that we should point out, the other big story is Thor at Ragnarok. And it's interesting if you look at the actual sources about this. There's not a lot in almost every one of the sources you look at. Ragnarok is not this drawn out battle that you read a lot about. Like it takes up maybe a paragraph or two or, you know, a few stanzas of poetry. It's the end of the world. You know, the gods get killed. In some versions, a handful of them do come back. Like Baldur comes back, although he had already been dead by this point. And Odin gets killed because he gets eaten by the Fenris wolf, AKA Fenrir, who is an offspring of Loki. And the Midgard serpent, by the way, is also an offspring of Loki and Hel, the goddess of the underworld, because in Norse mythology the devil is a woman. She's an offspring of Loki as well. Not to mention, of course, that Odin's horse slept near as Loki's offspring, because Loki can be both male and female and also does the shape shifting thing and weirdly has children when he goes and shape shifts. So this is sort of like Zeus, right? You know, you got the shape shifting, philandering, raping going on. So Thor faces off against the Midgard serpent at Ragnarok, does successfully kill him, but a lot of the dragon's poison gets on Thor. And in the sources it says he staggers back nine pieces. The serpent dies, but so does Thor, who was poisoned. Right?"}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #050 - 2022-08-25 - Thunder Gods and the God Who Thundered","start":8863.75,"end":9049.76,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"He failed his saving throw versus poison. That's right. So that's the end of Thor in the actual Norse sources. As you can see, he's not depicted as being this uber powerful being that, you know, that the humans must contend with, right to the way that, for instance, BAAL and Zeus are within the actual pagan context that we know a lot more about. What we have is a depiction written by Christians again centuries after Christianization took hold. So you might ask the question, like, well, why would Christians even tell these stories? I mean, they're about pagan gods and all this kind of stuff. Well, number one, they don't actually preserve pagan religion in terms of practices. So you're not going to learn how to worship these gods from these stories. It's just not there. Christians have every reason not to preserve that kind of information. Right? Why would they tell these stories so well, number one, remember, from the point of view of Snorri and these other Christian writers, we don't know who put together the Poetic Edda, by the way. We don't know. And it's possible that Snorri had a kind of committee that helped him do what he did, we don't know. But from their point of view, these gods are actual human beings. They're legendary humans. So these are legendary stories for them. And remember, Snorri is trying to put together a skaldic poetry textbook. That's his purpose. But even if, you know, he didn't regard telling these stories as being inherently sinful from a Christian point of view, occasionally he does say things like, now you shouldn't believe that all this actually happened. Like he'll say that. Right. For him, they're just stories, largely speaking. Mostly, you know, he does believe the Aesir existed, that they were humans. These Christians have no problem elaborating on these stories. They have no problem altering these stories. As far as we know, again, we don't have quote, unquote originals to compare them against. Why do they do that? Because that is how legends and their transmission work. That's just how they work. They're just retelling stories. And we should point out, of course, that even though we do actually have a lot of pagan texts from classical paganism and some of these other things, Semitic paganism, the reason that those texts are preserved over the years, largely speaking, is because Christians felt that it was useful to copy them and use them. So even though we don't have much in the way of Christian tampering with the stories altering, elaborate on them, they're copying them. Right. They're interpreting them, they're using them. So this is a thing. This is absolutely a thing. So this is part of how Christianity has kind of digested the mythology, the leftover stories from paganism."}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #050 - 2022-08-25 - Thunder Gods and the God Who Thundered","start":9114.19,"end":9400.24,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Yeah, yeah. Because, remember, for Norsemen, Writing and manuscripts is basically Christian technology. Like that's just the reality. I mean, you might wish, someone might wish that it was different, but that is the historical reality. We just don't. It's not that Christians destroyed a bunch of stuff that came there before them. It simply wasn't there. You know, we know the religion was being practiced. Like we find a whole bunch of probably Mjolnir pendants, for instance, archaeologically, from the few, you know, the centuries right around Christianization and earlier, we don't know what they were used for. Interestingly about, from what I understand, about 10% of the dependents that they found that were, that are hammer shaped were found in graves. And I don't know why this is the case. And I don't think anybody knows. The majority of them were women's graves. What's going on with that? We just don't know. You can't extract a religion from finding a hammer pendant that someone wore around their neck. And then also some people look at that as being an alternative or an answer to the Christian cross or whatever. They'll adopt that now and be like, well, we don't know what these were used for back in the day. They might be some kind of amulet, they might be, who knows? But we don't know. We just don't know. Just don't know. There's just big blank spots. Right. So the last thing I wanted to kind of mention about Christian kind of digestion of this stuff is the elements of these depictions, especially of Thor, right. Were retained and in some cases baptized. Now by that, I don't mean that, you know, people started worshiping Thor or anything like that. I just mean that the imagery connected with Thor got recycled. So a good example of this is St Olaf. So St Olaf is the patron saint of Norway. Now. He lives right around the time that Christianization is taking hold. So he, you know, he would have been familiar, directly familiar with Norse paganism. He's one of the latest saints, you know, right before the period of the great Schism between East and west and the church, early 11th century, if I recall. And he's regarded as a saint within a generation, if I recall. Yeah. And earliest depictions of him show him clean shaven. Right. Which is probably how he looked. We don't know, but that's how he was depicted as clean shaven. As time goes by, eventually, especially after the, after the early 13th century, so we're talking a couple hundred years, he starts getting depicted with a big red beard. That is a Thor image. Along with that he's also depicted in some legendary texts as a killer of giants. That is a Thor image and is generally a kind of protector against evil forces and demonic monsters and stuff. Again, that's Thor stuff. But you remember we talked about, you know, Christ and so forth. You know that, like, he's described as the rider of the clouds, right? It's not saying, you know, Christ is like baal. It's saying that actually that belongs to Christ. That title to belongs. Belongs to Christ. So you get this beginning of saints using this imagery from pagan mythology. But now it's been so many centuries since that was even believed in and practiced that they have no problem appropriating the imagery for this new patron of the place, St Olaf. So before we go to break, I just want to give a. A quick recommendation if someone's actually interested in really learning Norse mythology from the sources we have and not simply from the kind of collections and stuff of fairy tales and legends, which can be interesting, right, but are kind of largely aimed at children and so forth. There is a book called the Norse A Guide to the Gods and Heroes by Caroline Larrington, and her work is very good. It's a kind of summary and it's all entirely based on all these traditional sources. So. All right, well, this is going to be different from other episodes in that we actually have three breaks. There's four halves to this episode. So we're going to go ahead and take unprecedented. Our third and final break. And we'll be right back."}

So they've got a basic problem, right, which is that if you're going to say, well, Yahweh was a storm God who was part of one of these Canaanite pantheons, right? So first of all, they're shooting this pantheon idea way back into history beyond where it really belongs. But anyway, if they're going to say this kind of thing, right, then you would expect that we would have some kind of written or other source that includes Yahweh as part of a pantheon. And there is no such thing. There literally is no such thing. He is not listed in any of the Ugaritic material. Right. The name doesn't appear. Name doesn't appear in any. Right. Any of these lists of deities doesn't appear in, like, place names outside of Israel once Israel is a thing. Right? None of that. In fact, the way I've mentioned before, I think on the show, my Old Testament professor, my undergrad, Lawson Younger, the way he tracked what happened to the ten northern tribes when the Assyrians deported them is by looking for people with theophoric names with Yahweh in them."}

So they refer to Yahweh as being the God of these people. Right. And we've talked about this before on the show in connection to what are sometimes called the Yahweh from the south traditions in the Old Testament that talk about Mount Seir, which was the center of Edomite territory, as being the mountain of God. Mountain of Yahweh, of Yahweh having sort of come from there north to aid the Israelites in conquering Israel, conquering the Canaanites. That language is there. Right. Of course. Moses goes and encounters Jethro. Right. The Midianite priest becomes his father in law. So those groups were still worshiping Yahweh. Right.

Presupposition one, presupposition two. Polytheism is more primitive than monotheism, which is also a presupposition. Because you could equally argue, as anthropologists, et cetera, have, that there's actually a primitive monotheism that got complexified into polytheism, that it went the exact opposite way. Also with evolutionary presuppositions, they agree with the first presupposition, they disagree with the second one. Right. So you don't even have to disagree with all of these. I disagree with all of these. But even scholars are not united in agreeing to all of these. Polytheism is more primitive than monotheism. And third, monotheism is a thing. Modern monotheism, the belief that only one God exists, only one divine being exists, is a viewpoint that was held by anyone in the ancient world, even in late antiquity. Right. All of these three things are presuppositions that are either based on nothing or in the case of the third one, demonstrably false. Right. So that's what this is based on. This isn't. So anyone who comes to you and says this, like I said, even people who are educated people with PhDs, their defense of this is. It is the scholarly consensus."}

So, for instance, let's say someone has a biological father and a stepfather. Someone might say. I'm talking about. About your dad. Dad.

There are all these times, right, some of which we've already mentioned tonight, where language about BAAL in particular, so storm God language from the ancient near east about BAAL or Hadad or whomever gets sort of attached to Yahweh. So for example, one of Baal's titles, as we already mentioned is the Cloud Rider. You see the son of man on the clouds in Daniel 7. We already talked about Daniel 7, how this is like an inversion or flipping of the enthronement of Baal story. But Psalm 104 or 103 in the Greek verses 3 and 4, this is the Vespers Psalm in the Orthodox Church that talks about God walking upon the wings of the wind. That's Baal language.

Because to do that, they'd have to argue the Exodus was true or something. So they're not inclined in that way. But that's just to show you this, this language, this phenomenon in the Old Testament of taking the language used about the gods of the other nations and applying it to Yahweh as a way of saying that Yahweh is the true most high God. He's the one who brings the reigns, he's the one who controls the thunderbolt, he's the one who gives victory in war, etc. Etc. Etc. And by the way, he's the creator God, Right. Who created everything and caused things to be that before were not. Right. That practice is all through the Old Testament. And Israel's neighbors understood what Israel was doing when they did it. That's why there was this antipathy."}

And then there's this constant refrain, like it's over and over, especially in the Old Testament. But then you get echoes of it and repackaging of it in the New Testament.

And then what you especially get. And you get this in the Old Testament too, but especially the New Testament. For instance, I think of St. Paul's comments on the Areopagus, where he says, this is the God who made all things. He's the creator. Which pagan gods don't make that claim. They kind of reside within the world. I mean, there sometimes that they were involved in creation. Right. But not that there's one who made everything."}

And so what I just did in not even that long a time, especially for this show, is lay out a bunch of evidence and an argument which the other side on this, that Yahweh was a storm God, fundamentally doesn't have. They just have. Well, this is the scholarly consensus."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #050 - 2022-08-25 - Thunder Gods and the God Who Thundered","start":11330.38,"end":11700.71,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Yep, yep. So. All right, well, to wrap up this thunderous episode of the Lord of Spirits podcast, I just wanted to, you know, make a few observations to sort of summarize. And I think the first thing that we should point out is that, like, you see this in kind of Internet religion memology, this idea that look at these pagan gods that have these aspects or these stories or whatever, and then look at the God of Christianity. Look here. There's some similarities. That therefore must mean that the God of Christianity is derived from, as we were saying in this case, that he was a storm God. Because, look, they're the same image or the same title or the same story. Right. Often, leaving aside whatever the actual discontinuities are, which, as we like to point out on this podcast, are super important as much as the continuities to note that things are the same or similar, is a correlation. Okay? That doesn't mean that there is a causative relationship between those things or that they're the same thing. Just because there's a correlation does not mean there's a causation. This is a basic logical fallacy making them the same thing. They're not. Correlation does not equal causation. Right. And often, as we mentioned, a lot of what's going on in the scripture and in subsequent Christian history is it's a correction of pagan stories. It's a polemic against them. You know, the true rider of the clouds is the son of man, who is Christ. Right. The true, you know, commander of the weather who controls the thunderbolt is God, is Yahweh, not baal, not Zeus, not Thor. Right? That's what's going on, too. And then there's also. And we saw this especially with the Norse material, but as Father Stephen just pointed out with St. Paul neariopagus, there is an assimilation of the pagan stories as pagan stories stories. We'll take that and we're going to use it to our purposes, right? So St. Paul is just quoting a little verse and he's saying this actually applies to Yahweh, the God of Israel. But you get Norse Christians telling pagan stories sometimes for the purpose of poetry, Right? But he didn't see a problem with it. He didn't see it as a sinful thing to do as a Christian surrounded by Christians. Like, he wasn't trying to make nice with any pagans. There weren't any around. It wasn't a kind of ecumenical gesture. You know, they felt that these stories were helpful within their Christian context. Right. And many of the stories are told sometimes as an example of what not to do, sometimes saying, look, you can emulate and admire this heroism, this virtue, this perseverance, whatever it is. And they were just doing, and we didn't mention this yet in this episode, but they were just doing exactly what St. Basil, in his very famous address to young men on the right, use of Greek literature, by that he means Homer and Hesiod and so on, that there is a right use of these things, right? If there's any virtue, if there's any praise, think on these things and critique the things that are not virtuous and praiseworthy. That's what's going on as well. So Christianity has always made use of these stories. That's how it's always been. Whether it's to completely co opt pieces of them or to tell the story and offer commentary on it. These are things that Christians have always done. We do not have to be scared of that at all. I saw someone actually commenting on this show and saying, you know, these guys are using pagan mythology to try to quote, unquote, re enchant the world. And with this sort of implication of like, they're encouraging people to become interested in paganism. By no means. By no means. What I encourage people to do is to become interested in stories and become interested in the way that Christianity has used paganism, Right. Which always includes this polemic against the gods, Right. It's not about smuggling anything in or making nice or any of that stuff. Always includes that, who among the gods is like unto thou, O Lord? No one. No one. At all. Right? So understanding all that, then we can make an application of this kind of thing ourselves as we interpret this world and its stories and use them for preaching the gospel. Like we mentioned a bunch of times, Marvel Comics, the Marvel Cinematic Universe, especially when you talk about Norse stuff and you can tell that my opinion of that is lower than the Norse mythological stories. But I like watching those movies. I have read those comic books and I find them useful, right? It is a place that we can have conversations that can lead to a. A conversation about the gospel or lead to discussions of virtue or whatever it might be, and critique the characters and say, this one is good. This one did something that was not so good. Right? We can subvert even stories that may be by their creators intended to be subversive. We can subvert the subversion because Christianity has always done that. It's okay to continue doing it, especially because we know that we have the great hope of the resurrection, that we know that Christ has won the victory, that he is the one who has defeated the serpent. He actually did do that, and that his enemy, our enemy, death, its power has been broken forever. Since we know that, then none of the rest of this has to threaten us. And indeed, we can make use of it, because again, that is what Christianity has always done. Father Stephen."}

And we've talked before about how, thanks to our 19th century German friends, pretty much all of academic scholarship has been transformed into sort of a Wissenschaft, a scientific mode, a mode of aping the procedures of science. And that's had a lot of really bad results in a lot of ways, because a lot of fields have been turned into pseudoscience, essentially by trying to use a methodology that isn't really compatible with the field of inquiry. But one positive effect that it could have had, which unfortunately in a lot of cases it doesn't, would be that the term scholarly consensus would be interpreted as a bullseye. Something being the scholarly consensus would make it a target."}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #050 - 2022-08-25 - Thunder Gods and the God Who Thundered","start":11789.51,"end":12046,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"And this is true in science, right? Everybody wants to be Einstein and come along and overturn the consensus of Newtonian physics, Right? And you could prove that everyone wants to be that guy. Because what did Stephen Hawking do? He started going after the consensus around Einstein on several topics, Right? That's how it works in science. But most of the time when you get into any liberal arts or quote unquote, social science field, all of a sudden we de science and whatever the scholarly consensus is is just true. Now, it's not something we attack. It's not something we try to disassemble and take apart. It's not now the thrust of, okay, we need to find out why we're wrong, maybe completely wrong. And this boils down outside of scholarship. What you find in a lot of academia at the graduate school level is that graduate students tend to break down into factions of students who spend most of their time simping for one of their professors. They will sit in classes and argue with other students who are simping for different professors about which of their professors are right. And I've got bad news for those of you who aren't clergy out there, but this is what seminary is like, including orthodox seminaries. You have seminary students break off into factions and simp for one of their professors, and in some cases they spend the rest of their lives in ministry simping for that professor and what a genius they were and whatever their unique views are trying to promote them in the church. Right. And for clergy, listening, right? Embrace your secret shame of past simping. We've all fallen into it at one time or another. It happens. But how does this affect the average listener to this who isn't clergy? If you are clergy, stop simping. If you're not, how does this affect you? Especially in our modern, unfortunately, Internet based world, this has gone well outside of just academia and just graduate students. It's not really anything new. Right. St. Paul told us about how one claims they're of Paul and one claims they're of Apollos, and one claims they're of Peter and one claims they're of Christ. But seemingly everyone out there now is part of some fandom, is part of some camp, is, is simping for some public figure. They've developed some parasocial relationship with that public figure where they feel like they know them and they're known by them and they're out there having fights on the Internet about, you know, no, my guy who I like is better than your guy who you like. And your guy isn't really orthodox, and my guy is really orthodox and he's a better Christian and his books are better. And all of this is a monumental distraction from what our Christian life is supposed to be about, which is not dividing into factions, which is not finding somebody to follow, which is not finding some father figure on the Internet who is going to guide us into all truth and who we must now defend. And I'm including myself in this. And Father Andrew, whether he wants me to or not, I hope. Things I've written and things in this show and things in the whole Council of God podcast, I hope they've been helpful to you. Right. That's why I do them, is because I'm hoping they'll be helpful to people."}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #050 - 2022-08-25 - Thunder Gods and the God Who Thundered","start":12046.92,"end":12375.02,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Otherwise I wouldn't do them. People stop listening to the show, I'll stop doing it. If people stop buying my books, I'll stop writing them. Won't bother me. I have hobbies, other things I can do. It's not to get people to become DeYoungites or to follow me or to create a fandom or any of that. Right? Not what I'm about. Right. I can't be your dad. I can't be the spiritual father of everyone who listens to this show and everyone who buys one of my books. I can't. It's just not going to happen. But every one of us who are Orthodox Christians or Christians today are in a unique position in the history of the world because that same Internet that's led us down this distracted path of dividing into factions and following people and becoming fans, that same Internet has also given us, at least hypothetically, access to an unprecedented amount of information, an unprecedented amount of material about the faith, about the world, about history, about orthodoxy, about theology, about Christianity, about the Bible. And I hope the stuff I do, including this podcast, is a small part of that that's helpful to people. All of that is available to us and that makes every one of us responsible for it. So not only do we not need to get distracted by fannishness or simping or anything related to that, but we have a positive responsibility now. We are not living in a village in Greece before the revolution under the Turks, where we can't get printed Christian books, let alone have an Internet, and where we have to just, you know, do the best we can to maintain our faith in the face of oppression, in the face of being second class citizens and just continue to attend the services as much as we can, even if we don't really understand what's going on. Because they're in a Greek that we don't understand anymore. Right. But we need to keep that alive. We're in a position where every single one of us has the ability to really appropriate Christianity, to really understand at a level that our forefathers and mothers in the faith would have been desperate to have. Most of our ancestors of faith would be desperate just to own a Bible in a language they could read, let alone have a hundred translations at their fingertips, let alone have all the instruction and all the teaching that we have available through ancient faith and other outlets. And we're going to be held accountable one day with what we did with it. But with all of this available to us, it's not just a question of this threatening kind of thing about the Last Judgment, though that's there and that's real, that we will be held accountable for what we did with what we had. But with all of this available to us, the church today should be the strongest it's ever been. The people in our churches should have the deepest understanding of the faith, should be living the Christian life with a nuance and depth that was never before possible. I don't feel like I'm doing that. I don't know if anyone listening feels like they're doing that, but if there's anything unprecedented about our current church life, I think it's in the opposite direction and we don't have an excuse. So my final thought today is that we're not just working on doing the best we can, like Snorri Ol Snorri to understand our newfound Christian faith in the light of the cultural traditions of our people and how those fit together. We have this wealth available to us and if we take advantage of it, if we stop getting distracted by all the stupidities that come along with the Internet giving us access to it, if we commit to it, then this is going to benefit us. This is going to transform our generation. This is going to transform the world into the future. This can be the time where Christianity, real Christianity, historic Christianity, blossoms and comes forth and becomes a force in the world as it never has before. Or it can get just turned into another fandom on the Internet of, oh yeah, the Orthodox folks, they're over there in between the Bronies and the Furries. And in terms of the real world, they've accomplished nothing. And it's up to each of us, because each one of us, right? If you're able to listen to this show and get things out of it right, then you have what it takes to take advantage of the resources available to you and become the kind of Christian in this historical and cultural moment that God is calling each of us to be."}
