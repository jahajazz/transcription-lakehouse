And he will be the light of the nations and the hope of those whose hearts are troubled. All who dwell on the earth will fall down and worship him. And they will praise and bless and celebrate with song the lord of spirits. First Enoch, chapter 48, verses 4 through 5. The modern world doesn't acknowledge, but is nevertheless haunted by spirits, angels, demons and saints. In our time, many yearn to break free of the prison of a flat secular materialism, to see and to know reality as it truly is. What is this spiritual reality like? How do we engage with it? Well, how do we permeate everyday life with spiritual presence? Orthodox Christian priests, Father Andrew Stephen Damick and Father Stephen DeYoung host this live call in show focused on enchantment in creation, the the union of the seen and unseen as made by God and experienced by mankind throughout history.

Yes. I know Cerinthus is somebody you all think about every day, but Cerinthianism is sort of a version of what comes to be a larger category of heretical Christologies called adoptionism."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #106 - 2024-12-12 - When God Became Man","start":715.91,"end":723.35,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Yeah. The idea that Jesus is a man and he gets sort of made God. He gets adopted as the Son of God."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #106 - 2024-12-12 - When God Became Man","start":723.51,"end":805.1,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Right. That's where the adoption comes from. But just he's a divinized. He is a man who is divinized in some way at some point. And so this is. That's a broad category. Obviously, adoptionism is called adoptionism. Rather than being called after the name of a person, there's not a guy named Adoptus who came up with it. But it's called that because it covers this. Why? So there were adoptionists who thought that Jesus became the Son of God at the resurrection at different points. Right. But Cerinthus in particular taught that Jesus of Nazareth was just a man, but then at his baptism, the divine Logos came and sort of attached itself to him. So you have within there the idea that the Logos, the second person of the Trinity, and Jesus are different people, sort of, but who are connected. And that connection happens after a certain period in Jesus Life. This is actually the heresy for which the author of the Last Temptation of Christ was excommunicated from the Greek Orthodox Church."}

That this isn't just a category for lumping together everybody whose version of Christology doesn't hold to Christ's full humanity. Right.

Yeah, like, no, they had like liturgies and they read the Bible and preached and yeah, like they had a whole thing going on. It's just they had this one, one element very wrong. Right. In their theology. And that was reflected in places in their worship and in other things. Right. There was fallout from that, but they were also functioning communities. And so one of the questions then comes like, well, what kind of communities were these communities? Right. And the default answer you'll get from most. So the number of people actually studying docetism, Right. Like they wrote their dissertation about docetism is relatively small, as with any other hyper specialization in academia. Yeah, Right. So, and in any Hyper specialization in academia. You have tiers of literature, right? So you have the books on docetism written by the handful of, you know, $130 paperback Brill Books written by the people who are scholars of docetism, Right. And they're talking about docetism on one level. So when I say most scholarship, I'm not talking about that because that is like hyper nuanced and stuff, right?

For example, the big thing that, that categorizes most of these Gnostic groups that causes them to get thrown into that basket is that there is a confused certain confusion of metaphysics and ethics where they view matter as evil, right? And then spirit as good. And so, yes, in most sort of gnostic schemes, they're all over the place because there's all these different fractured sects of Gnosticism. They're not going to have anything like an incarnation of the Christ or the Logos. Sometimes in these Gnostic systems, the Logos and the Christ and Jesus are three different people.

But Sergeant, Jesus, ever part of their. And Marcus Borg is now deceased. John Dominic Croissant is still around and kicking, feisty as ever. But the part of the agenda of some of those folks was they were trying really hard to make an argument that Gnosticism preceded orthodox Christianity. Yeah, they really wanted to argue, especially Funk, that Gnosticism was the original Christianity and it was actually orthodox Christianity, what we now call Orthodox Christianity that was a heretical offshoot of the original Gnosticism. And you know, we will go into all the reasons why of that. A lot of it had to do with not understanding Gnosticism. But there was this kind of view, very boomerific view, that somehow Gnosticism was like sexually liberated and gender egalitarian and all this stuff, which is absolutely not true. But that was the idea where. As opposed to mean old, crusty, misogynist Christianity. And so they made all kinds of arguments hypothesizing an early Aramaic version of the Gospel of Thomas that we don't have, that was written before the canonical gospels, on and on and on. Right. And so there was this impetus throughout that sort of movement to try to make Gnosticism as early as possible. The problem with this whole thing, of course, is that gnosticism is a 2nd century phenomenon, a mid 2nd century phenomenon. It is in the mid 2nd century an attempt to, in some cases not all sort of sprinkle Christian terminology and symbolism across paganism and make this sort of syncretistic hybrid. They do the same thing with Judaism. They do the same thing with different forms of Eastern religion insofar as they had access to it. They just sort of gets sprinkled and syncretized with Greco Roman paganism, with Egyptian religion. So really that, that's what Gnosticism is. It's this syncretistic tradition within Greco Roman paganism in the mid second century. So by roping or looping Docetism, which actually did exist at the end of the first century, into Gnosticism, by making it a kind of Gnosticism. Well, look, we just put Gnosticism back into the first century, boys. We just need another 60 years or so and we're golden. Right. Unfortunately, they couldn't manage to get gnosticism back that 60 years. It just didn't work and it all fell apart."}

And the real. Honestly, the. Even some of the participants now have kind of yielded to the analysis that when you go looking for the historical Jesus, the Jesus you find looks a Lot like you. At best it looks like an idealized version of you. Right. Like it looks like what you aspire to be. And so, yeah, even among the participants of the Jesus seminar and the third quest for the historical Jesus, they all publish their books on the historical Jesus. And none of them agreed with each other about anything hardly. You know, which makes it real hard to argue that this is the product of like objective scholarly research when everybody's conclusions are completely different in terms of some pretty basic things. Right, well, so if we, so we rule this out, we say like, there's no reason to bring Gnosticism into this discussion."}

You get some people proposing, well, maybe this is a Jewish Gnostic group. Right. That he's dealing with, to try to like split the difference. Right.

Right. After talking about Christ, suffering in the flesh, is talking about making no provision for the flesh and its desires. Right. On and on and on. Right.

And we're not saying they're necessarily already docetists around, but again, where did docetism come from? And what we find and what we've talked about before on the show in various contexts and that we're going to be talking about more now in the second half is the fact that by the time you get to the first century within Second Temple Judaism, there is this belief, a very firm, solid belief expressed in various ways that the Messiah, Right. Who is going to come is some kind of pre existing divine or divinized being, the Logos, the Son of man, the Messiah. This is a being that already existed before coming as the Messiah. Right.

Give them a call at 855-23-7-2346. That's 855-AF-RADIO. The centuries after the Protestant Reformation brought about a radical reinterpretation of The Epistles of St. Paul, disconnected from any historical reality. But Paul operated during his entire life as a faithful Pharisee within the Roman Jewish world. In St. Paul the Pharisee, Jewish apostle to all nations, Father Stephen DeYoung surveys Paul's life in writings, interpreting them within the holy tradition of the Orthodox church. This survey is followed by DeYoung's interpretive translation of St. Paul's epistles, which deliberately avoids overly familiar terminology. By using words and ideas grounded in 1st century Judaism, DeYoung hopes to unsettle commonly held notions and help the reader reassess St. Paul in his historical context.

A question that might be somewhat pertinent tonight, though I guess we'd have to rewind time a little bit. In the Gospels, there are mentions of both the disciples and our Lord preaching the gospel. And Father Ender, I've read your book on this topic, and so I'm curious, what was the gospel they were preaching at that time, before the crucifixion and resurrection had happened? I don't think we're as much getting into Jesus being as open about his proclamation as the incarnate Son at that time. So what was the gospel they were preaching?"}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #106 - 2024-12-12 - When God Became Man","start":3662.46,"end":3770.86,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Yeah, I mean, the short version of it is simply repent for the kingdom of God is at hand. Right. It says this very explicitly. You know, that Christ is preaching that gospel, John the Baptist is preaching that gospel. Repent for the kingdom of God is at hand. Certainly all the things that Jesus was about to do would not have been in the content of that necessarily. But that's the idea is that that there's this conquest that is coming and Jesus is the conqueror. And so you need to repent if you're going to be on board with what's coming. Right. So all the details are not quite there yet, but the message is there. And I mean, it's clearly effective. People are repenting when John the Baptist preaches that even before Jesus is on the public scene, you know, so, so, yeah, I mean, that's, that's what it is. Very basically. It's, it's, it's, it's really about you. You need to change your way of living because the kingdom is coming and this is how citizens of the kingdom live, you know, so that's, that's the, the action item, so to speak, is repent. Because things are about to change. Everything's about to change. It's at hand. As, as St. John says, the ax is laid to the root of. You know, so, yeah, I mean, they're not saying Jesus has been crucified and risen from the dead yet. But of course, there are points, There are points when Jesus tells that to his disciples. You know, one point where Peter kind of says, you know, rebukes him, like, stop saying that. That's weird. But yeah, it's. Yeah, it's repent. For the kingdom of God is at hand. Is there anything I left out there, Father?"}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #106 - 2024-12-12 - When God Became Man","start":3771.58,"end":3870.45,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Well, and I mean, in context, the kingdom of God is at hand brings the whole prophetic corpus to us, right. For Jewish people, so they understand this is referring to the day of the Lord, the day when God will visit his people. He will judge the heavens of the earth. His enemies will be defeated. Right. So saying the kingdom of God is at hand and therefore you need to repent that they would have understood it within that prophetic context. This is about to happen. Therefore, now is the time. Now is the time to repent. No more procrastinating, no more putting off. Right. This is about to happen. But, and it's not that the content of what Christ was about to do wasn't in it. It was in it, but it would have been phrased and framed the way what Christ was going to do is framed, for example, in Isaiah. Right. Or in, in Ezekiel. Right. So it would have, it would have been described in that prophetic mode. Right. And I think this is part of the reason why there you see the different reception between Saint John the Forerunner and Christ not by someone like Herod, but by the people. Right. St. John the Forerunner is still speaking in the terms they're used to hearing, but it's just telling them that time is coming soon."}

And that was a time that they were looking at with hope and fear and he was telling them what they needed to do to prepare for it. Right. Whereas especially when you get into the latter portion of Christ's ministry and he does start as Father Andrew said, he starts saying, oh, I'm gonna go to Jerusalem and be crucified. Oh, you know, this is gonna happen. That's where people start going, whoa, hey, wait, time out. What? That's not what we're expecting. Wait, right, we thought the Christ remains forever. Yeah. Right. And so that's where you start seeing people drift away and even some people becoming antagonistic to Jesus and the idea that he's the Messiah. Right, within that context."}

Would you maybe also say that in kind of foreshadowing the ultimate triumph over the dark spiritual powers with the resurrection and Holy Saturday, do you have the casting out that's happening as well? Sort of, you know, paving the way for kind of the more fuller. Fuller defeat that was soon to come."}

Although, I mean, I would say that that's just like, you know, the army has landed on the beach and immediately begins shooting the enemy. That's what happens with Jesus in the exorcism. Yes, they're not all quite wiped out yet, but like the exorcisms are not just a foreshadowing, it's the. It's the initial assault."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #106 - 2024-12-12 - When God Became Man","start":3967.82,"end":4014.28,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Right. But also exorcism was. We talked about this. In at least one episode, exorcism was associated with the Davidic Messiah. Yeah, in the sense it was. There were a set of Psalms of David that were used for exorcism, and that's likely connected to the fact that it's David who finishes wiping out the giant clans. He's the one who does the mop up. And so there's a connection there with the Davidic Messiah also, which is why in the Synoptic Gospels, Christ's exorcism activity is sort of particularly important."}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #106 - 2024-12-12 - When God Became Man","start":4073.54,"end":4110.27,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"So there is this second Yahweh figure in the Hebrew Bible. There is, and that's defined in various ways. One of them is we talk about, there is this sort of blanket statement repeated many times over that no one could see the God of Israel, no one could see capital G God. No one could see Yahweh and live. And then we have a whole bunch of examples of people seeing Yahweh and living."}

It's literally mouth to mouth in the Hebrew. And then nine verses later, nine verses later, Moses asks God to show him his glory, his chavod. And God says, you cannot see me and live. And it's like, wait a minute, like you don't even have to turn a page, like."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #106 - 2024-12-12 - When God Became Man","start":4160.48,"end":4165.68,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"So clearly there's a Yahweh that can be seen and a Yahweh that you can't see."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #106 - 2024-12-12 - When God Became Man","start":4166.24,"end":4201.21,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Right. And so this is one of the basic breakdowns and this is what St. John is commenting on in his prologue, not the verse we read previously, but when he says no one has seen God at any time. Right. But depending on your manuscript tradition, the unique God or the unique Son who is in the bosom of the Father has made him known. Right. And again, St. John is not retconning the Old Testament, he's saying all those times when people saw God, who they were seeing was the sun, the Logos."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #106 - 2024-12-12 - When God Became Man","start":4201.53,"end":4202.62,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Yeah, right."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #106 - 2024-12-12 - When God Became Man","start":4203.02,"end":4381.69,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"But that bosom of the Father language is important there too, Right. Because that's language when you read second temple Jewish texts that talk about a pre existent Messiah. So take for example in the book of Enoch, first Enoch in the book of Parables, when it talks about the Son of Man, right. This, this pre existing Messiah figure who had identifies as the Messiah who is going to come into the world and be the Messiah, it identifies this figure as being sort of hidden in the bosom of the Father from essentially eternity past from before the creation of the world and who is then going to be revealed on earth as the Messiah. And so that language, that traditional language is what St. John is referring to there when he talks about him being in the bosom of the Father. So this is a very common thing as you read through. And they don't all agree about who this figure is going to be. Right. I'm not saying they all believed in orthodox Christian Christology. Exactly. In Second Temple Judaism. That is not at all what I'm saying because this is still what they're doing is they're reading prophecy, they're reading the Hebrew scriptures and they're trying to figure it out. Yeah, right. And they have this shape and they have this shadow and they have this outline and they have these types. And from that they're trying to figure this out. Right. And then the reality of that, of course becomes clear once you know, that figure actually reveals himself in the person of Jesus of Nazareth. But they have this outline and there are these different titles like the Son of Man referring to the Daniel text. Right. Which we've talked about before on the show. And we've talked about before on the show how one of the ways that this idea that there are these two persons of Yahweh gets reflected in the Targums is that the, the Aramaic Targums will, in these places where someone sees or interacts directly with God, insert the word memra, which means word. Right. So instead of, you know, instead of saying God appeared to Abraham, it'll say the word of God appeared to Abraham. This is where the Logos language comes from in St. John and in Philo, Logos being Greek, it's the debar Yahweh in Hebrew."}

Yes, call it, if you're a docetist, I guess, and tell me I'm wrong. Feel free to call in about whatever. But so what we're going through there. Yes. Christ came in the flesh. Christ, flesh and blood. Yes. That was probably non controversial to 99.999% of our readers. Right. Or our listeners. And probably what we were just talking about because we've spent dozens of hours at this point on this show talking about Old Testament Christology and theophanies. People have probably most of our listeners who have listened to that. If this is, if tonight's not your first night, you're probably at least somewhat on board with those ideas of the second power in heaven and this kind of thing being an idea that already existed in Second Temple Judaism before Christianity. Here's where it gets problematic. A lot of These appearances of God in the Old Testament, these theophanies, these appearances that we're going to say are the second person of the Holy Trinity, that are the Son. Right. That are the Logos, that are the Son of Man. Right. That are ultimately Christ. Right. A lot of these appearances, even though they're in the Hebrew Scriptures, even though they're in the Christian Old Testament, when this figure appears, he has bodily physicality. Yeah, he has bodily physicality that does things and that functions. Yeah."}

All right, we're going to cover part of Exodus chapter 24. So I'm going to read through this. It's the first 18 verses. Then he, that's God said to Moses, come up to the Lord. You and Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, and 70 of the elders of Israel and worship from afar. Moses alone shall come near to the Lord, but the others shall not come near, and the people shall not come up with him. Moses came and told the people all the words of the Lord and all the rules. And all the people answered with one voice and said all the words that the Lord has spoken, we will do. And Moses wrote down all the words of the Lord. He rose early in the morning and built an altar at the foot of the mount and 12 pillars, according to the 12 Tribes of Israel. And he sent young men of the people of Israel who offered burnt offerings and sacrificed peace offerings of oxen to the Lord. And Moses took half of the blood and put it in basins, and half of the blood he threw against the altar. Then he took the book of the covenant and read it in the hearing of the people. And they said, all that the Lord has spoken, we will do, and we will be obedient. And Moses took the blood and threw it on the people and said, Behold the blood of the covenant that the Lord has made with you in accordance with all these words. Then Moses and Aaron, Nadab and Abihu and 70 of the elders of Israel went up, and they saw the God of Israel. There was under his feet, as it were, a pavement of sapphire stone, like the very heaven for clearness. And he did not lay his hand on the chief men of the people of Israel. They beheld God and ate and drank. The Lord said to Moses, come up to me on the mountain and wait here, that I may give you the tablets of stone with the law and the commandment which I have written for their instruction. So Moses rose with his assistant Joshua, and Moses went up into the mountain of God, and he said to the elders, wait here for us until we return to you. And behold, Aaron and Hur are with you. Whoever has a dispute, let him go to them. Then Moses went up on the mountain, and the cloud covered the mountain. The glory of the Lord dwelt on Mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it six days. And on the seventh day, he called to Moses out of the midst of the cloud. Now, the appearance of the glory of the Lord was like a devouring fire on the top of the mountain in sight of the people of Israel. Moses entered the cloud and went up on the mountain. And Moses was on the mountain 40 days and 40 nights."}

There was no frequent vision at that time. Eli, whose eyesight had begun to grow dim so that he could not see, was lying down in his own place. The lamp of God had not yet gone out, and Samuel was lying down in the temple of the Lord where the ark of God was. Then the Lord called Samuel and he said, here I am, and ran to Eli and said, here I am, for you called me. But he said, I did not call. Lie down again. So he went and lay down. And the Lord called again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and went to Eli and said, here I am, for you called me. But he said, I did not call my son. Lie down again. Now Samuel did not yet know the Lord, and the word of the Lord had not yet been revealed to him. And the Lord called Samuel again, the third time. And he arose and went to Eli and said, here I am, for you called me. Then Eli perceived that the Lord was calling the boy. Therefore Eli said to Samuel, go, lie down. And if he calls you, you shall say, speak, Lord, for your servant hears. So Samuel went and lay down in his place. And the Lord came and stood calling, as at other times, Samuel, Samuel.

When he saw them, he ran from the tent door to meet them and bowed himself to the earth and said, o Lord, if I have found favor in your sight, do not pass by your servant. Let a little water be brought and wash your feet and rest yourselves under the tree while I bring a morsel of bread that you may refresh yourselves. And after that you may pass on, since you have come to your servant. So they said, do as you have said. And Abraham went quickly into the tent to Sarah and said, quick, three seahs of fine flour, knead it and make cakes. And Abraham ran to the herd and took a calf, tender and good, and gave it to a young man who prepared it quickly. Then he took curds and milk and the calf that he had prepared and set it before them.

To them and to all ancient people, the idea that physical objects had spiritual power was very intuitive, whereas modern people tend to find this difficult, bizarre, or even unchristian. This is because we live in an era shaped by secularism, a way of viewing a world that's incompatible with sacramental thinking. Because secular ideas are at the heart of our culture, modern people tend to think in secular ways without realizing it. Even the most well meaning of us. How then do we live in but not be of a secular culture? We need to understand the enchanted, sacramental way that the early Christians viewed the world. But we also need to understand secularism. What is it really? Where did it come from? And how does it influence how we think about religion? Journey to Reality Sacramental Life in a Secular Age breaks down these important issues in the accessible, non academic language and is an ideal introduction for young readers, catechumens and seekers, as well as for any Orthodox Christians who want to deepen their understanding of the sacraments."}

And so one of the ways that that's done is by saying, look, she's just an ordinary person. Right. And so what would an ordinary person who's just been married do?

Right? So the person Jesus Christ died on the cross. He is God and ergo, transitive property. You could say God died on the cross. Just like when St. Peter in Acts refers to Christ's blood as God's blood. Right. Christ's blood is God's blood. Right. It is blood that belongs to God, but it's human blood. It's Christ's human blood that belongs to God and therefore is God's blood. So anyway, I felt the need to clarify that in the face of chicanery, right? But that is to say, apropos of our topic tonight, Christ had a human conception, right? Albeit a virginal one. He had a human gestation, he had a human birth, right? Grew to physical maturity as a human, and he died a human death, albeit voluntarily, right? He died a human death. But now that brings us to the resurrection, because what we're just talking about is the way humanity exists within time and space, which is true, but humanity also exists outside of time and space, right? You have to affirm this unless you're a Sadducee, right? If you. If you're going to say humanity doesn't exist outside of time and space unless you're a Sadducee or an atheist. But I repeat myself anyway, because to say humanity does not exist outside time and space is to say there is nothing when you die, there's nothing afterwards."}

So humanity also exists outside of time and space, right? Outside of the materiality of this world and this life, there is human existence, right? And for us as Christians, this takes the form of resurrection. And this is not just the resurrection on the last day, but St. John in Revelation will refer to the saints in glorious, having experienced the first resurrection, right? They have already experienced the first spiritual resurrection, the reconnection of the soul to God, right? Because remember, it's been a while since we repeated this, although we've repeated it a bunch of times on the show John of Damascus. There's two kinds of death. Physical death, separation of the human soul from the human body, spiritual death, the separation of the human soul from God. And so the first resurrection, the spiritual resurrection, is the reconnection, the full reconnection of the soul to God. This is what the saints have already experienced. So they are now truly alive, not dead, Right? This is why Abraham, Isaac and Jacob are alive, not dead. And Christ says, when he's talking to the Sadducees about it, he says to them, right, that the fact that Abraham, Isaac and Jacob are alive is proof."}

And when he had taken the scroll, the four living creatures and the 24 elders fell down before the Lamb, each holding a harp and golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints. And they sang a new song, saying, worthy are you to take the scroll and to open its seals, for you were slain, and by your blood you ransomed people for God from every tribe and language and people and nation, and you have made them a kingdom and priests to our God, and they shall reign on the earth.

What is being said here by St. John. Right. Is that Christ's self offering on the cross, which obviously intimately involves his humanity. Right. It's what, it's what makes it possible. So Christ the second person of the Trinity, having taken upon himself our human nature, his self offering on the cross, this is the basis for the creation of everything in the universe. And this is the purpose of the creation of everything in the universe. As St. Paul says about Christ, through whom and for whom are all things created?"}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #106 - 2024-12-12 - When God Became Man","start":8379.34,"end":8417.51,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Right. The basis of the purpose, the telos, the beginning and the end, the alpha, the omega. Right. That's what St. John is saying. And this is all over the New Testament if you look for it. Right. Like I said, St. Paul has it. St. John has this as a major theme, as we just said. Right. So the incarnation, Christ's humanity is a fact of creation. It is the goal, it is the purpose, it is the whole thing."}

The whole thing is what Saint Maximus is getting at with the Logos and the, the logia of creation all being connected to him. Christ stands at the center.

{"episode_id":"LOS - #106 - 2024-12-12 - When God Became Man","start":8444.16,"end":8573.69,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Right. This isn't any, anything like that. Right. This is the whole game plan. Right. God created a world, a universe, and he created people to share his love with. And the way he does both of those things, the way he creates, the way he reveals himself, the way he shows his love, is through the humanity of Christ, through the incarnation of Christ, through. That's how it happens. And the only way we come to know God is in the person of the incarnate Jesus Christ. That's not just true. Since he was born circa 3 B.C. that's true. In the Old Testament, St. John said, no one has seen the Father, the only begotten, or the unique Son. The unique God saved in bosom has made him known. But that's also true, to go back a few episodes, Christ was the way that your primitive hunter gatherers in the Neolithic era came to know God. He is the way in which God is inscribed in the creation. In the sky they looked at at night, the ground they foraged for food, the love they shared with their families. Right. Christ was inscribed in all of that. And that's how they came to know God and how to find salvation. So the Incarnation is at the center of everything. Right. But goes beyond just this world's materiality and our understanding of the flow of time and the limits of space."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #106 - 2024-12-12 - When God Became Man","start":8579.61,"end":8988.73,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"So to wrap things up here, if you happen to be watching this or listening really to this episode via YouTube or you've seen the promo images for this particular episode, the icon that's in that image is the creation of Adam. And if you look at it, you can see on the left is Christ. And on the Right. And slightly below him is Adam. And you can see Christ breathing the breath of life into Adam. There's a really interesting detail if you look closely at this icon, and you may not notice this unless someone points this out to you, but you might also notice it for yourself once you see it. You can't unsee it. And that is that God in the flesh in this icon of the creation of Adam, his face and Adam's face are the same face. Right. So what is going on with that? Well, man is made in the image of God, or as it says in the Greek text of Genesis, he is made according to the image of God. And this is depicted in icons quite literally. Well, who is the image of God? Christ is the image of God. He is the image of the invisible Father. And so if Adam, if humanity is made according to his image, it makes sense to depict that in an icon in terms of Adam looking just like Jesus. Just like Jesus. And it's Jesus in this icon. It is very clearly Jesus. You know, this is not the faceless Jack chick Christ. This is Jesus. And that is a very profound icon in light of everything we've just said for the last two and a half hours. So if Christ, the incarnate Christ is the basis of creation and the purpose of creation, and he makes us according to him, according to him, he who is the image of God, what does that say about humanity vis a vis the whole creation? It means that this whole creation is summed up in humanity. And that when we talk in Christianity about mankind being the pinnacle of creation, the center of creation, the priest of creation, all of this stuff, it's because we are made according to Christ. It's not like a special status. You know, God made all these creatures and said, oh, I like this one. I'll make him the chief of everything. No, it's that baked into the very nature of humanity is that we are meant to be in Christ, the Christ who created all things, the Christ through whom all things were created, the Christ for whom all things were created, the Christ slain from the foundation of the world, the Christ who is enthroned in glory. And we are invited to sit on thrones next to. To his, that Christ, the one and only Christ, Jesus, the Son of God, the Son and word of God. That's the. The purpose of humanity. That's our very purpose. Right. Someone was asking in the YouTube chat, like, what does this have to do with our salvation? It has everything to do with our salvation. Because salvation is not just, where do I go when I Die like. One of the themes we've talked about for the last four plus years in this podcast is the destiny of humanity in Christ. And that destiny is to be, as St. Paul said, seated in the high places with him. That destiny is to be glorified, to become by grace what he is by nature, to become. One of my favorite verses, Luke 20:36, Jesus himself says, sons of God, equal to the angels, sons of the resurrection, right? And all of this is apparent in this icon of God making Adam, of Christ making Adam. And you see, they have the same face. They have the same face. All of this is there. And if you understand, then this aspect of the incarnation that we've been talking about for this episode, I hope it will drive you to repentance. You know, repent, for the kingdom of God is at hand. That's what the kingdom of God is. That's what the kingdom of God is. And our repentance is moving towards being worthy of that. We don't make ourselves worthy. It's Christ who made us, who makes us worthy. But he gives us the way to receive that from Him. He gives us the way to live, the way to repent. This faithfulness is a gift from God. We didn't come up with it ourselves. St. Paul says that. And therefore it's through that faithfulness, by grace, that we are saved. So I feel like I say this at the end of a lot of our episodes, but far from this being about just sort of speculating on weird, esoteric, pedantic theological minutiae, this once again goes to the right, to the heart of what it means to be Christians. And it is the Alpha and the Omega in the Scriptures itself, Genesis to revelation, but most especially in the face of Jesus Christ, our true God, our Savior, the Redeemer of our souls. So that's what all this means to me."}

So this particular episode, I hope you didn't learn anything, and I hope it is of no practical value to you, and I hope it doesn't help you with your repentance or your salvation. I wanted to do something else during this nativity season where we're celebrating Christ's incarnation, because I think there's one thing needful for a lot of us. And as always, when I say these kind of things, I'm including myself. Right? We want to learn things and we want to understand things. We can become obsessed sometimes to the point of scrupulosity, with our own sin and repentance. Working out our own salvation, and obsessed with the practical matters of living in community, all of which are important, all of which are important. But I think there's also an important place moving past all that work, all that toil and all those very important things day to day, for awe directed toward God, toward awe and admiration directed toward our Lord Jesus Christ for who he is and what he has done for us. And this is very much available to us in our orthodox worship if we're looking for it, if we're not noodling around in a copy of the service text, trying to understand it and trying to reconcile this statement on this page with that statement over there. Well, how do those make sense together? We're not obsessed with the fact that we, you know, got cut off and cussed somebody out on the way to church and we feel guilty about it. And if we could set all those things aside for a minute and just get in touch with who God is and what he has done and who Christ is and what he has done, which goes so far beyond what we can comprehend, what we can reason about, what we could explain with some cool proof texts and fancy logical arguments, that leaves. This is one of my favorite verses of the Akathos to the Theotokos. That leaves the philosophers as voiceless as fish, right? Just being in rapt awe for a while. That's what I hope. Thinking about some of the things, some of the brain hurts things, some of the things that don't quite make sense, some of the things that make us nervous that we talked about in this episode. That's the effect I hope it will have for me and for our listeners tonight. There will be some moment here as we approach Nativity or as we celebrate the feast, or as with family, celebrating the feast, friends, where we'll have that moment of just wrapped awe where we stop trying to understand and explain."}

That's where I'm aiming with this episode. That's why I think we sometimes need to talk about things that are past the limit of what we can really understand and push past that barrier. So that's my hope. Our next episode is going to be pre recorded, but so this is the last time before Nativity. I'm going to talk to you guys live. But that's my, that's my Christmas wish for you."}
