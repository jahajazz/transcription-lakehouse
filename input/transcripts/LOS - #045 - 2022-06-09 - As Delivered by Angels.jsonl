And he will be the light of the nations and the hope of those whose hearts are troubled. All who dwell on the earth will fall down and worship him. And they will praise and bless and celebrate with song the lord of spirits. First Enoch, chapter 48, verses 4 through 5. The modern world doesn't acknowledge, but is nevertheless haunted by spirits, angels, demons and saints. In our time, many yearn to break free of the prison of a flat secular materialism, to see and to know reality as it truly is. What is this spiritual reality like? How do we engage with it? Well, how do we permeate everyday life with spiritual presence? Orthodox Christian priests, Father Andrew Stephen Damick and Father Stephen DeYoung host this live call in show, folks. Focused on enchantment in creation, the union of the seen and unseen as made by God and experienced by mankind throughout history. Welcome to the Lord of Spirits."}

But it's easy for me to say giant killers, dragon slayers said giants killers. I think that becomes a football thing then. You are listening to Lord of Spirits podcast. My co Host Father Steven DeYoung is with me from Lafayette, Louisiana and I'm Father Andrew Stephen Damick in Emmaus, Pennsylvania. We are recording live, but we're actually not going to be taking phone calls tonight. That said, if you leave a question on our Facebook or ancient faith YouTube streams and we spot it, there is a chance that we could take it and respond. So tonight we're talking about textual authority. I know that sounds like a hoot, but stick with me here. As Christians, whether it's the Bible, the Apocrypha, the writings of the church fathers, texts related to the ecumenical councils or the divine services, we have a lot of texts. So how are we supposed to understand these various texts? In what sense are they authoritative? That's what we're talking about tonight. Now, as we are wont to do, we're going to begin looking at this question in the ancient world thousands of years ago, beginning even before the writings that make up the holy Scriptures. So what's up first tonight, Fr. Stephen? Are we going to look at that Sumerian clay tablet where someone complains about how kids don't obey their parents anymore? Things just aren't what they used to be?"}

So Sumerian Renaissance was definitely a slight uptick. But yeah. So we're talking about texts that play a particular kind of role in a community tonight. Right. So complaint notes like that, or hate mail or grocery lists, trade receipts, we're going to leave those aside and talk about first things that aren't the Bible, that even precede anything in the Bible, but that had a function in their respective communities in the ancient near east that were something like the function that the Bible would come to have."}

Right. And an oral use of storytelling or narrative or ritual performance that then eventually gets written down. I'm sure that guy complained about kids these days all the time before it was written down, but that's still not quite what we were talking about."}

Right. Like you can't just think up like. Well, I mean, L. Ron Hubbard did. But most people can't just sit and think up a bunch of rituals and then get people to go along with them. Usually these are things that form semi organically. We talked about that back when we talked about sacrifices and encounters with spiritual beings. But so a couple of early examples that are kind of helpful in terms of what we're talking about. So people, at least people who listen to this show, have probably heard of the Enuma Elish, which is the sort of Babylonian creation account."}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #045 - 2022-06-09 - As Delivered by Angels","start":375.34,"end":387.02,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"That a myth is a story that has this sort of ritual component that sort of keeps that story alive and makes it real in the experience of people. When all of that drops out, it becomes mythology."}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #045 - 2022-06-09 - As Delivered by Angels","start":388.62,"end":394.22,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"And so most folks, I'd wager, who have read the Enuma Elish have approached it as mythology."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #045 - 2022-06-09 - As Delivered by Angels","start":395.1,"end":401.01,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Yeah. It's just a story that doesn't actually play a part in their life in any way, except maybe as a piece of entertainment."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #045 - 2022-06-09 - As Delivered by Angels","start":401.41,"end":411.81,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Right. Or. Or, you know, from a very sort of Protestant perspective, we say, oh, this is what the ancient Babylonians believed about how the world was created."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #045 - 2022-06-09 - As Delivered by Angels","start":411.89,"end":412.61,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Right. Right."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #045 - 2022-06-09 - As Delivered by Angels","start":413.09,"end":481.41,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"So it's about thoughts or beliefs. Right. And this isn't just picking on our Protestant friends. Right. Like, everyone does this. We all tend to think of other religions in terms of our own religion. Right. Because our own religion is the religious experience that we have. So it was sort of natural for Protestant scholars, when they started studying ancient religion, to look at it in terms of beliefs and what people held to. And then going forward, as there were sort of wars that we talked about how. And how not to read the Bible episode, there's sort of wars over how to read the creation account in Genesis. Right. Then when people turn to the Babylonian creation account, they tended to read it the same way. So either they said, well, this is just sort of poetic, interesting stuff, or they said, no, this is exactly how they believed it happened. But the Enuma Elish actually in Babylon was actually reenacted every year."}

There were a series of processions to a sacred ziggurat, and the processions were considered to be processions of the gods. So the idol that was the body of Marduk was picked up and carried down there, and the idols of the other gods from the other cities were carried there in procession. And then there was this reenactment with the king embodying Marduk in the story. Yeah."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #045 - 2022-06-09 - As Delivered by Angels","start":513.55,"end":524.59,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"And it wasn't understood just as a kind of play. Right. Like, look, we're putting on a story, but that this thing is happening again and we're part of it."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #045 - 2022-06-09 - As Delivered by Angels","start":524.83,"end":526.75,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Right. We're participating in it."}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #045 - 2022-06-09 - As Delivered by Angels","start":528.19,"end":546.79,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"And the reason it kept being done is, of course, this is how the world was created. And as we've pointed out, for ancient people, this isn't about being versus nothingness. Because especially when you look at, like, the Enuma Elish, there's nothing created out of nothing. Right. Everything's created out of something else."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #045 - 2022-06-09 - As Delivered by Angels","start":547.03,"end":547.43,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Right."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #045 - 2022-06-09 - As Delivered by Angels","start":547.75,"end":569.11,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"But it's things being put in order. And so this gets repeated and participated in as a way of maintaining that order. Right. And this is a pretty constant factor in all kinds of pagan religions. Right. You know, you look at Mesoamerican human sacrifices, that was to maintain the ordering of the world and keep it from ending, right?"}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #045 - 2022-06-09 - As Delivered by Angels","start":569.35,"end":573.27,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Yeah. If you don't do this ritual, then really bad, bad things will happen."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #045 - 2022-06-09 - As Delivered by Angels","start":573.51,"end":602.79,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Yeah. And so this was the same kind of thing. This was maintenance. Right. Of the order by reenacting it was actually doing something. But of course, that annual festival, all of those ritual elements are now gone. And so now it just sort of gets read as mythology. Mythology. Another example. And this one's a pretty obvious example. Right. This isn't a narrative text per se, though there are narrative elements of it is the Egyptian Book of the Dead."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #045 - 2022-06-09 - As Delivered by Angels","start":603.75,"end":609.67,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Which is basically a manual for doing funerals in the Egyptian religious tradition."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #045 - 2022-06-09 - As Delivered by Angels","start":610.15,"end":626.82,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Right. So it's all the funerary and burial rites. And so that includes some sort of narrative elements about Osiris and Anubis and. Right. And the gods. Right. But those narrative elements are then actually sort of played out in the rituals."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #045 - 2022-06-09 - As Delivered by Angels","start":627.3,"end":635.14,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Yeah. That you. By doing the ritual, you are participating in Osiris's story of him dying and that sort of thing."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #045 - 2022-06-09 - As Delivered by Angels","start":635.14,"end":711.19,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Right. So what's happening when these things are written down? Right. So these stories are still being told orally, they're being passed on orally, and they're being enacted in this ritual. What happens when they finally get written down. Right. Is that once they're written down, they become. That becomes the normative form. Right. Now, this is the written form. We talked before about how expensive and difficult writing something down was. So it is written, is this big statement. Right. It's like a literary monument. And you still find this in oral cultures to this day. In oral cultures, you can have two people, two storytellers from that culture tell the same story, and their tellings of it can be radically different. One could be an hour long and one could be 20 minutes long. And yet if you ask one of the storytellers who listened to the other, did they tell it correctly, they say yes, even though it was totally different than their own telling. But in those same cultures, once a version of that story gets written down, then correct becomes conforming to the written text."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #045 - 2022-06-09 - As Delivered by Angels","start":712.07,"end":713.19,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Yeah. Right."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #045 - 2022-06-09 - As Delivered by Angels","start":713.51,"end":723.59,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"And then any telling that doesn't conform to that or any ritual enactment that doesn't follow the text once it's written down is now wrong, is now incorrect. Right."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #045 - 2022-06-09 - As Delivered by Angels","start":723.99,"end":726.81,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Yeah. Look at. Do it by the book, essentially."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #045 - 2022-06-09 - As Delivered by Angels","start":727.37,"end":766.81,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Right. And so this is. This is a way of. Of establishing something like that permanently. Of reducing variation. Right. And of Locking in a true version. And, and this is why this is part of. We've talked about before several times on the show how a number of the narratives and non narratives, poetry in the Psalms, elements in the Old Testament especially, will take elements of ancient Near Eastern religion in other cultures and invert them or change them or correct them. Right."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #045 - 2022-06-09 - As Delivered by Angels","start":766.81,"end":767.21,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Yeah."}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #045 - 2022-06-09 - As Delivered by Angels","start":771.81,"end":772.97,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Right, Right. Right."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #045 - 2022-06-09 - As Delivered by Angels","start":773.13,"end":789.68,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Here's right. And the, the Old Testament doing that is not like a weird thing. Right. The fact that it's written down already carries with it culturally this idea of this is now going to be the correct version."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #045 - 2022-06-09 - As Delivered by Angels","start":790.16,"end":849.5,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Yeah. And I think that's a really important point about the way actually the whole Bible in a lot of ways functions. It's not, it's not that it was written down to create a whole system of religious belief and structures and rituals and so forth, but rather that it came about within an existing social reality. And you know, it doesn't come out of nowhere. Right. It's not a founding document, it's not a constitution. Right. Although, I mean, if you think about the US Constitution, it is very self consciously a response to other kinds of government. Right. So it's a response. The scripture, one of the ways to look at it is that it's a response to other things that are already happening on the ground. And it's an attempt to, to correct that, to fix it, to create new norms or to, you know, to create, to set norms for a particular group of people."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #045 - 2022-06-09 - As Delivered by Angels","start":850.14,"end":860.54,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Right, right. And, and we've lost that sense of something written as a monument because now, you know, I could go and self publish something on the Internet, you know, and."}

So the printed word has gotten kind of cheap. It wasn't cheap in the ancient world. So this also means that we see this throughout ancient Near Eastern and even into late antiquity to a certain extent in paganism, where you have a class of priests whose job is essentially to be able to read."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #045 - 2022-06-09 - As Delivered by Angels","start":889.56,"end":895.08,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Yeah. To read the stories as part of these ritual experiences that people have."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #045 - 2022-06-09 - As Delivered by Angels","start":895.08,"end":955.42,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Yeah. They're supposed to maintain the documents, copy the documents, be able to read the documents, know how to perform the rituals. Right. So this starts out as just knowledge that's handed down orally, but then once it goes into written form, then you get lector priests in Egypt. You get, you know, the priests who are in charge of the Sibylline books in Rome. Right. Where their job is to be able to consult the books to consult the things written, to know how to do these things. But again, it's not about, you know, here's a set of truths that are to be believed. It's not about even here's like some hidden knowledge about the universe. Right. And salvation. It's that, that here's the correct procedure. Right. Here's the correct way to do this, way to tell the story, the correct way to do the ritual. Right. The correct application of these things."}

They would go, something would happen. You know, there's a comet. Oh, that's a bad omen. What do we do? Well, we went and consulted the books, and the books said we should bury three slaves alive. This is an actual example that happened."}

Or a horse, if we're Caligula, you know, so. And we're this horse. We're not used to. Now thinking of the Torah this way."}

Right. And there's countless examples of this, but sort of exhibit A of this is Passover, Right. Where you have. It's even given for. Right. It's laid out first. Here's how you are to celebrate the Passover in Exodus, and it gives all of the ritual instructions for celebrating the Passover every year. This is to be your first of months. So it even starts constructing a ritual calendar. Right. All of that information comes first, and then the actual event of the Passover happens afterwards."}

That's why, you know, the, the Bible doesn't make a really good screenplay kind of as written. You're like, wait, let's take a moment here. Like, yes, yes, certainly there's death instruction about to come. But we're going to first describe this ritual to you and how you're going to do it for the future. Because it's not a play by play of what happened. It's. It's a text within a ritual context. So of course, those ritual instructions are there and our primary."}

Right. We think, well, no, that's like, so people could read it and know what they should and shouldn't do morally. Right. So the problem with that is nobody could read and they didn't have access to the texts even if they could. Right. Because there were so few copies and they were treasured and the priests had possession of them. So the way people had access to what was in those texts was through the priests. Right. They would come and participate in the rituals and in the feasts and in the sacrifices and when they came and participated. Right. So this would be sort of mediated to them through the text and through the priest. Right. That's how they found out about it. So those commandments were not. And they were not just in there for the priests to sort of advise people. Right. Though obviously it should be obvious that hopefully priests were doing that. Though we know from reading the Old Testament that that was not necessarily the case. Most of the time they should have been teaching people what to avoid and what not to do. But for the most part, those sins are in there because the priest has to know what to do about them when they happen. Because remember the priest's job, the job that this is a manual for. Right. The priests there in, whether it's in the camp, in the wilderness, whether it's in the temple later in Judah, their job is to maintain purity through. Through the sacrificial system, to manage the sin in the camp or in the nation so that God can safely remain living among them. Right?"}

I mean, probably in my mind, the classic example being the institution of the Day of Atonement ritual is given in response to one of the narrative parts of Leviticus in which Nadab and Abihu really mess up and God kills them. You know, fire comes out from the Lord and kills them there in the tabernacle. So that's given.

Now, the book is mostly a book of how to do vespers and orthros and the Divine Liturgy and all these services. Right. You know, as they say, you know, say the black, do the red. Right.

That's the, you know, gathering together for the church service. Never stand at the synaxes having hatred toward anyone so as not to banish the comforter. And so this is a commandment to priests, like, don't go to, you know, don't serve angry, basically, because that's bad for. For this. So it's, it's a, it's a. It comes off as a moral commandment, but it's a moral commandment in service to ritual. Right. So this is, you know, this is, this is. Even till today, we, we have the same kind of use of texts."}

Now this is aimed at. Here's how we're going to implement these things now that we're not in a camp in the wilderness anymore. Now we're going to be in the land. Right. So people have fits.

And he especially uses it when he's talking about, like, the presbyters in the church and what they do and the episcopy. Right. The bishops. Right. As we would say. Right. The leadership in the church that they are managers of the household of God. Right. He's directly appealing to this language. And we hear that in English. And because we're so used to law. Right. This law code thinking, we think that's something other than and different from what was going on in the Torah. Right. When really what St. Paul is saying is thoroughly consistent. He's saying that the presbyters of the New Covenant in the church have pretty much the same job as the presbyters, the elders of the people in the Old Covenant."}

Our 19th century German friends would say that's because it hasn't been written yet. But we're not going to get into all that right now. But they don't. The idea here is related to where the Torah came from and what it is. Moses goes to the top of Mount Sinai and as we've talked about before, enters into the divine council, right. The law is given through angels, right. He speaks to God face to face. We've talked about how this is Christ, right? And so he has this direct experience and direct encounter with God, as we talked about in the last episode about prophets."}

And so the Torah comes in this mediatorial role between this direct experience which they can't handle. And this is not just some kind of psychological weakness, right. Death by holiness is a real thing. This is something they can't abide because they haven't been purified for it. And therefore there is this teaching that functions mediatorially. This is, by the way, why when we read in Jeremiah and Ezekiel and Joel about the coming of the Holy Spirit in the new covenant, this is why we get this element of you will not have. A man will not have to teach his brother, right, to do this and not to do that, because the law will be written on their heart, right?"}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #045 - 2022-06-09 - As Delivered by Angels","start":2424.69,"end":2450.13,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Right? And so once a person has been purified by the blood of Christ, they are able to experience God directly. That takes the form of the filling of the Holy Spirit. And so now they don't need the Torah in this instrumental role anymore. That doesn't mean that the Torah is like, no longer valid because the Torah is still the description of that experience."}

That's still real, but that's why that mediation is no longer necessary, because now we can all. We can all approach. But so for that same reason, the prophets in the Old Testament didn't need the Torah in that mediatorial or instrumental role."}

So Saint Elias, prophet Elijah can come to Ahab and because of his direct encounters with God, he could come to Ahab and denounce his wickedness and pronounce the judgment of God against him without needing to cite or proof text because he knows who God is. The core is. This is Christ. But the important element to carry forward. Right. Is that even when the Torah is serving this instrumental role, the authority is never in the text itself."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #045 - 2022-06-09 - As Delivered by Angels","start":2536.73,"end":2570.35,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Right. Because if it were, then prophets having direct experiences would not, you know, sort of trump. It's not trump. But they would have to be citing the Bible. Right. They could not simply say, look, thus saith the Lord, because he said this to me. It would always have to make some reference to the text, because if that's where the authority is, but rather the text points to an experience. And if you're having that experience, then you're also accessing the actual authority, which is God himself."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #045 - 2022-06-09 - As Delivered by Angels","start":2570.99,"end":2617.02,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Right. And so this is. God himself maintains the authority. Christ maintains the authority. Right. The text is mediation to allow a person to draw close and have the direct experience of God in Christ. And this is. When we talk about the formation of Rabbinic Judaism, what makes it very different than the religion of ancient Israel and of Second Temple Judaism? This is the big shift. The authority goes to the text itself. So you no longer have a succession of prophets, you have a succession of scribes who read and interpret and apply the text. Right?"}

We don't have radically different versions of books or the different versions we have of the book of Daniel or the different versions we have of the book of Esther. So what happens is that the Hebrew Bible and the Christian Old Testament, which are technically different things, just sort of emerge out of ancient history and they emerge from a process. They aren't a series of books that are written down by different people at these specific points in time and then all get wrapped up together, together in a book."}

And we have folks who are now, especially in sort of the anglophone, English speaking Orthodox world who come from those backgrounds. Right. And so there's still a little bit of that reactionary idea. And so there's some people who seem to feel like they need to like be more conservative than the church fathers. Right. So you get people wanting to argue against all reality that, you know, Moses wrote every word of the Torah as we have it today. Right, right. And like, if you actually read what the church fathers say about it, like a good portion of them, a good portion of them, because they had read for Ezra, they'd read the Epistle of Barnabas, they read other texts, Right. That contained this tradition. A good portion of them thought that ancient Israel lost the Torah and that Ezra miraculously recreated it so that it comes from Ezra and they'll make offhand comments about it."}

Because there were people in the ancient church who could read Hebrew. St. Jerome was one of them, maybe not so well, but he Could. And they don't feel the need to say that. Right. St. Jerome literally says, whether you think what we have is what Moses wrote or whether you think Ezra restored it, this is what it says."}

The sources themselves is not a large amount of text. Text, but there's variations between them. And, you know, even in as much as these might have been used in Norse religion in some way, we don't know. In most cases, you're going to say that this version is the. This is the true Odin, you know, or whatever. Or what about the fact that Loki seems to be relatively late. I'm sorry, Marvel fans. Loki is a relatively late addition probably to the Norse mythical, you know, source text. Like there's variation.

So as we were saying, right, These, these texts, it's not just these are texts and scribes are copying them and interpreting them and debating their interpretation, but these are functioning ritually.

But then as we mentioned, with the writings, the Ketuvim, there's a big catch all in the Hebrew Bible in the Old Testament. That's where you've got stuff all over the map. Right. So Ethiopian Jewish communities have Jubilees and Enoch and a whole bunch of stuff that most Palestinian Jewish communities don't have that aren't functioning that way there. And then you've got Jewish communities in what's now Spain, in Rome. And so which of the writings are included? Even in Palestine, where obviously Judea is where you'd think they'd have this sort of more nailed down, There were arguments about the writings, whether Ecclesiastes was or wasn't authoritative, whether Esther was or wasn't authoritative, whether Ben Sirach was or wasn't authoritative. So there are these disagreements even there. Right. Sort of in the. In the Hub. Right. And then making it even more confusing. Right. There isn't like, because again, we're not.

And we're going to talk more about Josephus in a little bit. But Josephus, who's a Pharisee, does not accept Jubilees as being canonical, as being an authoritative work.

Right. This is what Josephus says is the canon. These are the books that were authoritative for Josephus because Josephus was a Pharisee. And so this is the, the 39 books that are now the Old Testament. In most Protestant Bibles, when you see the church fathers and rabbinical sources refer to them, they usually refer ancient ones. They usually refer to them as the 22 books that's because a bunch of them were combined on the same scroll. So, like what we call the minor prophets, the 12 of them were on one scroll. The book of the 12."}

So part of the reason why the Jomnia stuff gets started, part of the reason why people want to say, well, no, that Hebrew Bible canon that emerges in Rabbinic Judaism, that was the Pharisaic canon, that was just. Everybody in the first century accepted that those were the canonical books. Right. We sometimes hear this from our Protestant friends when arguments break out over, you know, for example, the longer Latin canon or the longer Greek canon or. Right. Any of these. Right. In terms of specific Old Testament books, say, no, this is. Everybody knew at the time. And when they say that, they're essentially taking a quote from Josephus, the aforementioned Josephus."}

Therefore, it naturally even necessarily follows that we do not possess a myriad of divergent books which conflict with each other. Our books, those which are rightly recognized, are only 22 and contain the record of all time. Of these five are the books of Moses, made up of the laws and the traditional history from the beginning of humanity to the death of the Lawgiver, from the death of Moses until Artaxerxes, who succeeded Xerxes as king of Persia. The prophets who followed Moses wrote the history of the events of their own times in 13 books. The remaining four books contain hymns to God and rules for the conduct of human life. From Artaxerxes to our own day. The complete history has been written, but has not been deemed worthy of equal credit with the earlier records because of the failure of the Succession of the prophets. Although long ages have now passed, no one has dared either to add, to remove, or to alter a syllable. It is instinctual for every Judean from the day of his birth to recognize them as the proclamation of God, to obey them, and if need be, willingly to die for them. And that's from the Contra Appion, chapter 137 44. I mean, it's pretty amazing that he's saying Judean babies are born. Born recognizing his canon."}

And that's why it's always, when it comes down to it, it's St. Paul's epistles to the Epistle to the Hebrews, regardless of what other conjecture there is or thought there is. So then, in terms of the other stuff, the other stuff of the New Testament, which is generally the general epistles in Revelation and Revelation is a special case that we'll get to in a minute. The general epistles we know are circulating as a collection at least by 180 AD. 180."}

And we know that they were circulating as a collection by then because Clement of Alexandria writes a commentary on them as a collection around that time. So that. That's why we know at some time before that they were collected together and that those texts are the ones where we see the big variations in different Christian communities. Communities. So there are some communities that very clearly only had. Only knew about First Peter and weren't aware of Second Peter."}

There are a lot of communities that didn't have Jude. There are. Jude is actually kind of interesting because this weird thing happens before the. During the centuries before the Council of Nicaea, where at first there are all these communities that had never seen the Epistle of Jude. And so we see people who are aware of the Epistle of Jude, saying, no, this is a really good canonical letter. Even though it's really short, this is a really good canonical letter because, see, look, it quotes the Book of Enoch, huh? Right? And so then as things shift in terms of people's impression of the Book of Enoch, right, and the authority it comes to hold, or not hold in most Christian communities, then all of a sudden the people who still kind of like the Book of Enoch are like, yeah, but St. Jude quotes it. St. Jude by that time becomes more firmly established, right, in terms of all the churches. And so they start using it to argue for the Book of Enoch instead of vice versa. But so there's. There's. That's where you get the most distinctions, right? But even in those cases, it's not that, like, places we're rejecting those books. It's not like we're fully aware of the Epistle of St James and we don't cotton to it, right? We gotta wait for Martin Luther for that, right? It's. It's just communities didn't know about it, right? And. And so the way this sort of organically happens, the way there comes to be sort of one canon across Christian communities, is that Christian communities, as they live their communal life and as they develop, they encounter other Christian communities or at least other communities who identify themselves as Christian communities, right? And when they do, there's sort of this process of mutual recognition that goes on, right? And for all the Martin Buber fans out there, right, he talks about the other and the other self, right? The idea being other, when you identify something as other, you're saying, this is not me and not not like me. Whereas when you identify someone as an other self, you're saying, this is another person, but they are a person like me, Right? Right. And so there's sort of this. Is this community a community, another community like ours, or is this community something different? Is this a different type of community? Right? And so one of the things that goes into that, right, they're all manner of factors that go into that, their liturgical life, right? The way they worship, the way they practice, how they do, all these things are factored into it. But one of those is what texts they read from authoritatively, right? And what we find is that when these communities come into contact with each other, right, If. If they're based. If they're using the same four gospels and they're using St. Paul's epistles, right? And they're like, well, These guys have two epistles, epistles of St. Peter, they say and we only have this one. They don't say, be gone, heretic. Right? Filthy apostates. Get out."}

Now, the four Gospels, they go, yeah, sir, this is a Wendy's, right? They're like, this is something. This is a church. The way church's chicken is a church. Right. This is not right.

You'll find surprising answers in this book. You'll learn that sacrifice had a very different significance for ancient people than it does for us today. You'll hear how it drifted away from this ancient significance into a fundamentally different meaning in our modern world. You'll discover how Old Testament sacrifices were gifts from the heart, only tangentially related to killing and death. You'll see in Christ's cross the ultimate gift that ushers us into communion with God. And you'll find inspiration to offer your own gifts alongside Christ's, inviting God into your life.

They didn't preserve traditions in writing. They did it orally. All the teaching was done orally. The learning was done orally. Traditions were handed down from generation to generation, just orally. And it's not until you get into like the 5th century that the tractates of the Talmud start being formed. Right, yeah. Ban on writing sort of gets lifted.

The content is definitely Johannine, but he seems to make reference to St. Paul's works. It's interesting actually that he doesn't ever quote John, which. But his theology is very Johannine, which kind of suggests that he just simply got the theology from the apostle directly and wasn't being mediated to him by, you know, a book. But.

And one of the big places we see that is in the work of George Sinkellos and Saint Nikephoros, the confessor of Constantinople. George Sinkellos did most of the writing on what's called the chronography, which was sort of the history of the world as a universal history world up to that time. And then he lived at the end of the 8th century, the very end, and sort of the history of the world up to that time, making use of all kinds of extra biblical literature, including the Book of Enoch and stuff, and sort of appended to the end of that by Saint Nikephoros of Constantinople, who was. So Georg Sinquelos is called Sid Kelos because he was the cellmate, monastic cell of St. Terrasios of Constantinople, who was the patriarch before Saint Nikephoros. So Saint Nikephoros becomes patriarch after St. Tarasios. He publishes George Sankellos chronography. He appended to it a listing of texts, and on it he lists for the Old Testament and the New Testament he lists. And so this is beginning of the 9th century, Saint Nickaphorus lists. Here's the books that everybody acknowledges in the Old Testament. Here's the books that some people acknowledge and not others. And here are the Old Testament apocrypha, the private books. Then he lists. Here are the New Testament books that everyone accepts. Here are the New Testament books that some people use and not others. And that's not just revelation, but it includes Revelation, includes The Apocalypse of St. Peter, believe it or not, and the Gospel of the Hebrews. And then he lists the New Testament apocrypha, which includes things like the Epistles of Saint Ignatius and the shepherd of Hermas and a bunch of first Clement, these things actually a lot of Clementine literature. So that idea, right, that there are these two categories of books to be read, one in public, in the churches, right, which he defines descriptively."}

So Jewish communities don't preserve, like the Testament of the twelve Patriarchs or the story of Joseph and Asenath. Right. They don't preserve even first Enoch.

We literally pray that we would be made worthy to hear the Gospel before it's read to us. Part of this liturgical ritual act. Remember, that's what we're talking about with these texts. Texts, right. It's not just authority in some banal sense. It's not authority in the sense that the text itself has this authority and commands us to do things and we must obey the text, but it serves this ritual function. And that function is to give us access to the experience of God in Christ. And we don't do that with even The Paschal Homily, St. John Chrysostom or the Cynicsarian or. Or write or any other text. But we do read them, right, and get a lot out of them, and they are preserved. And so this is sort of what I think of. Every once in a while somebody will critique Father Andrew and or I for talking about these extra canonical texts, and they'll say, why are you talking about these extra canonical texts? Either you shouldn't be talking about them at all, or more mildly, hey, there's a lot of folks out there who haven't even read the Bible, right? So why are you talking to them about and potentially getting them to read these other things that aren't in the Bible, Right? And what I think is, well, you know, St. John Chrysostom isn't in the Bible, right. St. Gregory the Theologian isn't in the Bible. St. Gregory Palamas isn't in the Bible. St Maximus the Confessor isn't in the Bible. St Aaron, if Leon isn't in the Bible, I would certainly encourage people to read those right now, if you ask me, should you read the whole Bible first? I'd probably say, yeah, that'd be good, right? Because it'll help you understand what the Fathers are saying because they read the Bible a lot. But I wouldn't say no, you are not allowed to read anything but the Bible until you have read the whole Bible. But that doesn't make a lot of sense to me. Right.

I mean, the same is true of liturgical practice. Right. Because liturgical change is a thing. There's even liturgical reform now in the history of the Orthodox Church. We're never talking about liturgical reform on the level of, say, for instance, what happens after the Second Vatican Council in the Roman Catholic Church. But there are liturgical reforms. There's of course, the Niconian reforms in the 17th century in Russia, which were hugely problematic at the time, for sure, but largely are what is received as modern Russian Orthodox liturgical practice. But also in the Greek speaking world, there is St. Philotheos Kokinos. He was a liturgical reformer and kind of streamliner. He's the guy who canonized St. Gregory Palamas, and I should mention, since I'm God willing going there, not too long, he's the guy who canonized the three Holy Martyrs of Vilnius. So there you go. Liturgical reform is a thing. How do we know that it was good? A particular reform is good. A particular change or introduction to something is good. By seeing how it's received, seeing how."}

I think it's me saying, hey, here's something Orthodox you don't know about, right? Try to get some more of this. And I'm only qualified to do a certain little piece of it. I can't do nothing with music, man. I can't carry a tune in a bucket. I can't help you with liturgical music. I can't help anybody with that. I'm not an expert on everything. I'm an expert on a tiny little sliver of things, right? And I kind of know some stuff about the broader things related to the Scriptures, right? But. And so I could try and help fill in some of that stuff, but we actually need a whole lot of other people doing this, but doing it with other areas, right? With liturgical music, with church fathers of different eras, with canons in the sense of the structures of the church, with church history, right? We need all of this, and we need it for years and years and years so that we can, can maybe in a few centuries have an American Orthodox Church that's a real and vital Orthodox Church. Not that America will be here by then, but an English speaking Orthodox Church somewhere in whatever's left."}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #045 - 2022-06-09 - As Delivered by Angels","start":10770.93,"end":11167.4,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Yeah, I know, I know. It's true. All right, well, just some final thoughts now here for our episode on textual authority. You know, along the way, we critiqued a number of ways of looking at texts, right? For instance, the desire to find, you know, like we in our, especially in our episode about how to read the Bible, you know, this desire to find what's sort of behind the text or what was in the mind of the author, this kind of thing. We didn't talk about that as much tonight, but that's related also to this question of attempting to reconstruct a basis for why certain books of the Bible are canonical. Reconstruct a basis for how ecumenical councils are ecumenical, who's a church? I mean, the list goes on and on and on, right? And what I believe, I certainly believe that a lot of these attempts are well intended, right? But there is nonetheless, even if they're well intended, if the person has in their mind to do something good, there is still a very problematic spiritual motion going on with that. And it's that a desire to get a handle on something that you can't get a handle on. I understand wanting to get a handle on stuff. I mean, I am an inherently curious person. I want to understand things. I want to take complex systems and try to figure out how to talk about them with people. I get it. Right. I get it. And I think it's important to try to get a handle on trying to understand what's going on in orthodox tradition. But when we attempt to create a kind of system that is the basis for how authority is assigned, then that's a kind of trying to get a handle on things that is actually stepping away from the way that the orthodox tradition actually works. And the beginning of really understanding how it works is, number one, accepting what it is as it is as it is, even if you don't agree with it or don't like it or are uncomfortable with it or even offended by it. Right. We receive the whole tradition, and then the task then is to try to understand the tradition, right? Not to come up with a system for figuring out how it gains its authority and all this kind of stuff. There's not. There is no system. There's no criteria. There's no, you know, it just doesn't work that way. Way, Right. So that's why I say there's a different spiritual motion involved. The spiritual motion of attempting to create a system for all of it is ultimately about trying to assert some kind of control over it. And I think that's why so many people who attempt to do this end up in a lot of arguments and debates over it. Why, which is not how the tradition actually works. Right. Certainly you have debate and argument within the orthodox tradition, but largely it has a pastoral purpose of rescuing people from being drawn away from Christ. It's not just about being right about certain things. And it's done by the people who have been given the task to shepherd people and to care for them. You know, we mentioned, for instance, the feasts of the ecumenical councils, the feasts of the fathers, and we've talked about this on the show before, you know, and there's that reading, that Old Testament reading from Genesis that's given in Vespers about how Abram, along with his 318 guys, goes and rescues his nephew Lot. And it's not coincidence that the traditional number of fathers at the first ecumenical council is 318. Whether that was literally the actual headcount there is not the point. The point is that they were engaged in a rescue mission for the church. They were rescuing people from error because that's their task. That's their job as the shepherds of the church. They weren't trying to create a system of authority to impose so that they would be obeyed. They were reaching out in Love to bring people back towards Christ, Right? And that's the spiritual motion that we need to engage in. It's the spiritual motion of accepting the tradition. I mean, you notice that the ecumenical councils, they begin with following the Holy Fathers, right? We have come up with a system, but following the. We're followers, you know, of the Fathers, we're followers of the Apostles. We've received the tradition, and now we're reiterating it in an appropriate way at this time and place to deal with whatever is in front of us. You know, it's. It's ultimately. It ultimately comes down to pride and humility. It comes down to pride and humility. And you can see when I know when I'm filled with pride, I want to show everybody how right I am and to defeat them. You know, when someone has humility, then it works in a very, very different way. And then actually the beautiful thing is, is that when you approach the orthodox tradition with humility, then it opens up in front of you as this beautiful, beautiful tapestry of endless possibility, of exploration and diving deeper into its depths. I know I'm kind of mixing my metaphors, but you get what I mean, I think. And so, I mean, that's my encouragement, is to enter into it with a sense of wonder. And wonder is based on humility. And that's how we receive the orthodox tradition, and that's how we're able to see and to describe how it is that texts function authoritatively within the Church's tradition. So, Father Stephen, what are your final comments?"}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #045 - 2022-06-09 - As Delivered by Angels","start":11170.36,"end":11588.3,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"So I think maybe some folks have gotten a wrong impression in terms of what we're about, not through any fault of their own. So we write from the beginning, like from the beginning of each episode and from the beginning of the doing. This podcast have been highly critical of materialism, meaning, you know, scientific materialism, the idea that the material is all that exists, right? The material is the real, and that's the limit of it. And the reason I think some folks may have gotten a misinterpretation is recently when I've taken to, as has been my want for some time, to bashing Plato, I think people have gotten confused, right? Because I think the easiest place for people to try to take refuge when they reject materialism is to try to go to the other end and become idealists and try and deal with things in the realm of ideas as if that's spiritual reality. What I think we're actually doing is neither materialism nor idealism, but realism, Right? Dealing with reality. I think you see that in our approach, like tonight, right, we're dealing with, well, how did these texts actually become canonical in history? How did it really happen in the real world? As opposed to the kind of idealist approach, which would be, what does canonicity mean? What are the marks? What is my theological system in terms of how the Scriptures work? And then, therefore, what does that require the Scriptures to be? And then what do I need to say about canonicity based on that to fit with the rest of these ideas? It's very easy and maybe even comforting as an escape because reality is not so great to go into that realm of ideas and act like, hey, if we could just get these ideas hammered out, if we could just get people have the right ideas and the right understandings in people's heads, if we could just get people to look at these things in the right way and hold the right opinions, that will cause a change in the world and reality, right? And the material will sort of fix itself, right? And the problem is that doesn't work, right. What you end up producing is a fantasy. And it's very easy for theology, even good theology, even technically correct theology, to just become fantasy. It's really easy for it to become the same thing as, you know, Star Trek canon is in my head, or Marvel or DC comic book canon is in my head. Theology can come to be essentially the same thing. It's very easy in theological debates for theology to become something like math, right? I use the right words, the right technical terms. I put them in the right order and use the right conjunctions. Therefore I am orthodox and I have correct theology. And you, sir, are not orthodox, therefore you have bad theology. And I'm going to argue that my conjunctions are correct and yours are wrong. And then if I feel like, or if people tell me I won the argument, then I will have won a great victory for Orthodoxy, and maybe that will help my salvation or something. But none of that is connected to reality in any way. St. James told us a long time ago, true religion is care for widows and orphans and keeping yourself pure from the world. Religion is about what you do. Not because the material is all that there is, but because the spiritual things that we talk about on this show, whether it's angels and demons, whether it's the Holy Spirit living through the Church, directing the Church. These are not ideas. These are things that are real. They're real. In addition to the material being real, we're talking about more reality that includes, but is not limited to the material. That's where we find our Salvation as orthodox Christians, in our material bodies, in this world, in communities with other people who often smell bad and don't look pretty to us all the time and don't dress the way we think they should and don't say things to us that we always like and don't go along with our great ideas and disagree with us about our brilliant ideas. That's the arena where all of salvation is worked out. And so we start with, rather than ideas and a theology that exists in the realm of imagination. We start with an understanding of God that's based in reality, the reality of the churches that exist, the reality of what the Holy Spirit has done through history, the reality of the lives lived by the saints before us. All of that reality is our basis. And then we take that reality and we apply it in reality to caring for others, to helping others, to loving others. And it's when we do that that our salvation is furthered, that things fall into place, right? You will never have assurance of your salvation or standing before God based on ideas because you can't trick yourself that well. You can't get out of having doubts about things through ideas. You can't deceive yourself that well. The only way to get past doubts and the only way to get past fears and the only way to have any kind of assurance of your relationship with Christ is to actually experience it in reality. And the way you do that is concretely by loving others, by participating in worship, by being part of a community, by loving people and being loved, right? And by participating, that's where you're going to find salvation. That's where Christ is going to become real to you. And all of the ideas in the world, right, are ultimately irrelevant in the face of what we actually live and do and practice and experience and become. So those are my final thoughts for this evening."}
