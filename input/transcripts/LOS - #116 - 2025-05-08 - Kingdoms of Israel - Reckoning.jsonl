And he will be the light of the nations and the hope of those whose hearts are troubled. All who dwell on the earth will fall down and worship him. And they will praise and bless and celebrate with song the lord of spirits. First Enoch, chapter 48, verses 4 through 5. The modern world doesn't acknowledge, but is nevertheless haunted by spirits, angels, demons and saints. In our time, many yearn to break free of the prison of a flat secular materialism, to see and to know reality as it truly is. What is this spiritual reality like? How do we engage with it? Well, how do we permeate everyday life with spiritual presence? Orthodox Christian priests Father Andrew Stephen Damick and Father Stephen DeYoung host this live call in show focused on enchantment in creation, the union of the seen and unseen as made by God and experienced by mankind throughout history. Welcome to the Lord of Spirits."}

And I'm Father Andrew Stephen Damick in Emmaus, Pennsylvania, perched precariously atop the arcane tower of podcasting, hovering dozens, dozens of stories I above a disused gateway to the underworld. And we are live. If you're listening to us live, you can call us at 855-237-2346. You can talk to us. We're gonna get your calls beginning in the second half and Mike Tin Pandeadpandagan will be taking your calls.

Let's think about this for a second. What are you saying when you say that? Okay, you're saying God came up with a list of commandments that no human could keep. Okay, well, he certainly could do that. Right. That wouldn't be hard. He's God. Right. He could come up with a list of commandments that no human could keep if he wanted to. Right.

Right. You know, when it says these people were completely destroyed, that's just sort of like saying, you know, our football team completely destroyed the other team. Right. It's not literal. Right, so, Right. So, so yet when an atheist wants to make this argument, they argue as if like, everything in the book of Joshua is historical fact. Why they believe that as an atheist, I don't know. Right. Like, okay, but this is a common problem with atheist arguments is like they read the Bible like they're a fundamentalist and then like, like, yeah, that's not how people read the Bible. But anyway, so that's how it gets presented to you is just this genocide. God commands them to go and genocide everyone living in this area because he's giving them the land.

And remember, as we mentioned Already, Deuteronomy chapter 4, when Israel is drawing close, is growing close to these nations in the Transjordan, who are also Abrahamite nations, they're told you're not to don't take any land from Edom because God gave Edom that piece of land which is a piece of this land that was given to Abraham, that has been given to his descendant Edom.

But Reuben and Gather sort of a settlement that gets negotiated where they're kind of allowed to do that, but only after they come and help with help the other tribes take. Take their portions. But even then, there's some dicey stuff. Like they build an altar over there. And the Israelis go, hey, what's with the altar over there? They're like, no, it's. It's a replica. So that when our kids ask us what the altar looks like, we can point at it and say it looks like that. That's literally their excuse. Yeah, that's. So there's a lot of dodgy stuff going on there. But then you get the tribe of Dan, which goes beyond dodgy. So we talked a little bit about the origins of Dan last time, that these are. Are actually primarily one of the Sea peoples, if we want to talk about, for the perspective of modern ethnicity. But the Danites now what happens is God says to each of the tribes, he lays out these land grants. That's before they actually take the land. And the tribes are supposed to go and take the land that God is directing them to."}

So what you get in Joshua 19, starting with verse 40, this has a lot of good fun Middle Eastern names. The seventh lot came out for the tribe of the people of Dan according to their clans and the territory of its inheritance included Zorah, Eshtaol, Irshemesh, Shaalabin, Aijalon, Ithla, Elon, Timnah, Ekron. Don't get triggered because it said Elon, by the way, gibbethon. Baalath, Jehud, Benabarek, Gathrimon, and Mejarkon and Rakon. With the territory over against Joppa, when the territory of the people of Dan was lost to them, the people of Dan went up and fought against Leshem. And after capturing it and striking it with the sword, they took possession of it and settled in it, calling Leshem Dan after the name of Dan, their ancestor. This is the inheritance of the tribe of the people of Dan, according to their clans, these cities with their villages. So not only did they not take the places with all those fun names, they went over to this other city."}

This is more than like five verses. In fact, this is Judges 18. In those days, there was no king in Israel. That's always a clue right there when it starts that way. And in those days, the tribe of the people of Dan was seeking for itself an inheritance to dwell in. For until then, no, no inheritance among the tribes of Israel had fallen to them. So the people of Dan sent five able men from the whole number of their tribe from Zorah and from Eshtaol, to spy out the land and to explore it. And they said to them, go and explore the land. And they came to the hill country of Ephraim, to the house of Micah, and lodged there. When they were by the house of Micah, they recognized the voice of the young Levite, and they turned aside and said to him, who brought you here? What are you doing in this place? What is your business here? And he said to them, this is how Micah dealt with me. He has hired me, and I have become his priest. And they said to him, inquire of God, please, that we may know whether the journey on which we are setting out will succeed. And the priest said to them, go in peace.

And he said, you take my gods that I made and the priest and go away. And what have I left? How then do you ask me, what is the matter with you? And the people of Dan said to him, do not let your voice be heard among us, lest angry fellows fall upon you and you lose your life with the lives of your household. Then the people of Dan went their way. And when Micah saw that they were too strong for him, he turned back and went to his home."}

And there was no deliverer because it was far from Sidon and they had no dealings with anyone. It was in the valley that belongs to Beth Rohab. Then they rebuilt the city and lived in it. And they named the city Dan after the name of Dan, their ancestor who was born to Israel. But the name of the city was Laish at the first. And the people of Dan set up the carved image for themselves. And Jonathan, the son of Gershom, son of Moses, and his sons were priests to the tribe of the Danites until the day of the captivity of the land.

That the human is inactive, the human is passive. So if God gives you faith, you have faith. You don't have to voluntarily or otherwise receive it. Right. In the Calvinist system, God regenerates you, meaning you are dead and could do nothing. Now, I don't know where they're getting that definition of dead. Last I checked, that meant your soul and your body were separate. But their version of dead is that you're an inanimate object and God then acts upon it to regenerate you. Okay.

Right. The fact that he did that doesn't just automatically mean that everyone receives it. Those who are faithful receive it. Those who are faithful receive their share of the inheritance. It's one of the central arguments of Romans and it's drawn from this paradigm in Joshua. But you got to set aside stuff like dispensationalism that's unbiblical, that contradicts what the Bible actually says, and go with what the Bible actually says, which is that God can give you a gift, God can allot you an inheritance, and if you are unfaithful, you will not receive it. But if you are faithful, you will receive it. It's really simple. And once you start thinking that way and go back and actually read the Bible, both the Old and New Testaments, that way you won. You'll start to wonder why you had all of that silly systematic stuff in the first place. Because it's pretty straightforward. Leave there in the Bible, once you're just reading it."}

And I just Wanted to ask about the ending of Joshua, because I read it. You said in your last podcast that the ending of Joshua says that all the land had been given to Israel. And I found it. And I just thought, what would. My dispensationalist friends who even served in Israel for decades, they definitely read that, but how would they respond to that? Are there some promises in the later prophets that allude to that? Like, what is their hope still in if it has already been given to them?"}

Yeah, I mean, obviously we think it's a profound misreading of the scripture, but I mean, some of the way that it's interpreted, a lot of it, Frank. And we don't need to go back into this deeply because we talked about in the last episode, but a lot of it is bound up in modern geopolitics, like the sense of, well, you know, all the promises haven't been kept. And so therefore, you know, we need to let the modern. We need to support the idea of the modern nation state of Israel taking these particular pieces of land. You know, that is one of the ways that it often is. And so, I mean, dispensationalism has had a big impact, frankly, on the foreign policy of the United States. But I personally don't. I mean, maybe you know about this better than I do, Father, but how they, how they, how they, how exactly they read that stuff to make it all seem like coherent whole to them."}

Well, that, that must be referring to a different set of promises. And like, what set of promises? And then I point them to the. Not one word of all the promises, right? It's like. And I don't get anything, but I think like Father Andrew said, you know, it's an obvious problem, and they brush it aside and they don't read it and they don't, you know, and I mean, hey, if you're a dispensationalist out there and you can, you have a really good explanation of that verse that you think you can conv Call in? Yes, but because I haven't heard one, I'm just being honest when I, when I point this out to people. But I think Father Andrew is pointing at something that's important because the, there's a sort of hermeneutic circle, right, where they say, okay, well, dispensationalism before 1948 predicted that there would be a new nation of Israel and now there is, therefore it must be true. And the reason I say it's a hermeneutic surgical is that that validation has then led to political support for Israel which has led to, you know, political, US political and monetary support for Israel has led to further success for the nation of Israel, which then is interpreted as further proof that dispensationalism is true, which leads to more support for Israel. Right. And it just forms this circle, right. This sort of self validating circle. And so I think the focus is on that, not on these things that might disprove it. It's sort of the same thing I find with my Calvinist friends when I take them to certain passages outside of Romans 9 through 11. Ephesians 1."}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #116 - 2025-05-08 - Kingdoms of Israel - Reckoning","start":4454.29,"end":4617.86,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Right. And I think for most of these people, I believe that they come by these interpretations honestly. And by that I don't mean that they honestly sat down and studied it and you know, although maybe they did, but rather that this is, this is the tradition that they received. And so it's, it's self evident to them. I mean, honestly, like, like this goes all the way back to the Reformation really when a lot of the big debates were happening between Martin Luther, like in these first few years. Right. Right after, you know, 15, 17, these big debates were happening between Martin Luther and these Catholic apologists that he, he had conversations with and debated publicly. And this kind of stuff they would say, look, you can't just Say that that passage of Scripture means that. That's just your opinion, buddy. When we've got, you know, however many centuries and thousands of years and everyone in the Catholic Church saying this, and he essentially said in response, and I checked this because I was curious about it, because it, I couldn't believe it initially, but I checked this. And he essentially says in response, what you hear almost every single evangelical say these days about how it is that they know that their interpretation of Scripture is true, which is essentially the Holy Spirit illumined me and I know it's true, which solves no hermeneutical problem. It doesn't. Because when you have people disagree and each person says, oh, this is what the Holy Spirit is telling me. Okay, well then which one is the Holy Spirit with? Or is he inspiring all of them to disagree with each other? I mean, that doesn't make any sense. But I think that most people, it's, they think that this just simply means that, that the Bible means this. The dispensational is obviously true, that Calvinism is obviously true, because when they read the Bible, that's what they see, because frankly, that's what they've always been trained to see. And in Luther's case, he wasn't always trained to see that. He came up with a lot of that stuff. Right. But everybody else from then on that's an inheritor of the Reformation has inherited that or has inherited whatever particular interpretation they're part of the, of the Reformation churches has, has adopted. You know, so, yeah, I, I mean, most people, if you say, if you were to say to them the stuff that we just said about those passages in Joshua and elsewhere, who are in the dispensationalist world, most of them would simply say, well, you're wrong, or whatever.

So this goes back to an earlier part in the conversation where Father Stephen, you mentioned that it was never commanded for the Israelites to go in and just massively slaughter everyone, but rather it was more about the ending, the ritual practices of these giant clans. And so my question is, there's a verse in Samuel that mentions the Amalekite and is often used today in some unsavory contexts to justify, you know, genocide and other things. And it mentions Saul speaking to. Or no, Samuel, I believe, is speaking to King Saul and is commanding him to not spare the women and children of the Amalekite clan for what they did to the Israelites in Egypt. And so my question is, how does the Amalekites differ from the other giant clans? Or do they? And how should we confront the people who use this verse to justify some despicable things today?"}

And I'm supposed to look at that and say, oh, God is clearly letting me do this other thing to these other people. In fact, I'm supposed to do that. Like, no, not every commandment that God gives applies to every single person in every single situation. It just doesn't. You know, God sometimes says, go do this to these.

And so the main thing that separates them from the other giant clans is that they were uniquely belligerent toward Israel. It wasn't that they were somewhere sinning and God brought some Abrahamites to judge them. It's that they tried to exterminate Israel when Israel was at Mount Sinai. They attacked Israel to slaughter it at Mount Sinai while God was present on Mount Sinai. And the text actually says, when God is commanding that the Amalekites be destroyed, that they dared to lay a hand upon the throne of God.

And so this was not, like, about taking prisoners, taking slaves, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. This was about you are executing justice. Right. But what Saul had done. Right. What Saul had done was he had taken the king, their chieftain, as a captive, and was parading him around to show how great Saul was in having won this military victory. He had taken the women and children as slaves. The women probably sexual slaves, probably concubines for himself. And he had taken all their livestock and stuff as sort of booty."}

And that's why there's this judgment against Saul from that episode, because rather than serving as the minister of God's justice, which is what the Israelite king was supposed to do, he was in it to enrich himself, to display his own power and wealth for his own sexual gratification, etc. Right. So he was behaving in this kind of obscene way in general, but especially when he had been given this. This other command. Right. This other command that there should be no more Amalekites.

This is probably a fairytale thing, but is there. Are there. Would there potentially be issues with there being sacrifices in a physical temple like that? And I know that in orthodoxy, we obviously have sacrifices of incense and, you know, the Eucharist is a sacrifice. Would that be a problem for us or what would be the answer to that?"}

Who'd have thought? Right? So, I mean, a bunch of things. One could say, number one, Christ is that temple. You know, he. He says that the temple of Ezekiel is Christ. But also it's been traditionally held by Christians that the animal sacrifices of, you know, the Temples of Solomon and the Second Temple, that those were essentially a temporary thing to stand in until the sacrifice himself, that is the Lord Jesus Christ, our Messiah, until he came. And so it would be attempting to kind of turn back the clock, as it were, but it would also. I mean. Yeah, it just doesn't make sense on multiple levels from a Christian point of view. And. Yeah, yeah. I mean, there. There have not been animal sacrifices in Jerusalem since, you know, the year 70, roughly.

And Elhanan, the son of Jaare Oragim the Bethlehemite, struck down Goliath the Gittite, the shaft of whose spear was like a weaver's beam. And there was again war at Gath. And there was a man of great stature who had six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot. Foot 24 in number. And he was also descended from the giants. And when he taunted Israel, Jonathan, the son of Shimei, David's brother, struck him down. These forward descendants from the giants in Gath. And they fell by the hand of David and by the hand of his servants. So, okay, so wait, so who is this Elhanan? I. I seem to recall that this.

Don't want to lock in a date of the Exodus or anything, but at least a couple hundred years has passed. These are descendants.

So it's not just that some individual humans from those clans survived and went and assimilated and became Philistines, it's that within Philistine territory, these giant clan families were having descendants and were continuing these practices.

{"episode_id":"LOS - #116 - 2025-05-08 - Kingdoms of Israel - Reckoning","start":6642.99,"end":6772.84,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Okay. Yeah. And so part of the idea here of David killing these last giants is that David sort of brings the establishment of the kingdom in the land to completion. And so another place where we're going to see that laid out is the covenant that God makes with David. Okay, now we have to understand something about the Old Testament covenants here. And this is something that St. Paul makes clear in Galatians and Ephesians and Romans. But this is also just there. St. Paul is pointing to things in the actual text of the Hebrew Bible. He's not just making up distinctions. Right. So you have the promises to Abraham, as we said, right, as we've been talking about the last couple shows, the Torah, then the covenant, that is the Torah does not sort of abrogate or realign or rewrite those promises, right? The Torah is an additional overlay to those promises. And what the Torah is concerned with is about them living in, continuing to live in. Right? Keeping the land that God had brought them into so that their life might be long in the land that the Lord their God had given them. Right? And that's when you look at the blessings and the curses, Leviticus 26, Deuteronomy 28:30, you see all the blessings and curses. It's not about eternal life. It's not about becoming like the stars of heaven. It's not about theosis. It's about fertile land, good crops, staying in the land, human flourishing. Yes. And the bad stuff, if you don't keep the Torah, is you're going to end up going into. You don't keep Torah, you're going to end up going into exile or death, Basically, to put a finer point on."}

But that's an overlay, right? The structure of the promises to Abraham. I am going to give you the land. And the fact that I give you a land will serve as a sign that this other promise concerning theosis and eternal life and the heavenly kingdom is true. That's its own thing, right? And then the Torah comes to deal with the life of the people of Israel, in particular in the land. Okay? So now this covenant with David is again an overlay, right? About David and his seed and his dynasty as king is an overlay of this. And it's an overlay that bridges between the covenant of the Torah and the promises to Abraham in a certain way. And I think we'll see that when we read basically that that covenant gets made in 2nd Samuel, okay?"}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #116 - 2025-05-08 - Kingdoms of Israel - Reckoning","start":6834.34,"end":6916.4,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"So 2 Samuel, chapter 7, starting with verse 8. Now therefore, thus you shall say to my servant David, thus says the Lord of hosts, I took you from the pasture, from following the sheep, that you should be prince over my people Israel. And I have been with you wherever you went and have cut off all your enemies from before you. And I will make for you a great name, like the name of the great ones. Of the earth. And I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them so that they may dwell in their own place and be disturbed no more. And violent men shall afflict them no more, as formerly from the time that I appointed judges over my people Israel, and I will give you rest from all your enemies. Moreover, the Lord declares to you that the Lord will make you a house when your days are fulfilled and you lie down with your fathers, I will raise up your offspring after you, who shall come from your body. And I will establish his kingdom. He shall build a house for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever. I will be to him a father, and he shall be to me a son. When he commits iniquity, I will discipline him with the rod of men, with the stripes of the sons of men. But my steadfast love will not depart from him as I took it from Saul, whom I put away from before you, and your house and your kingdom shall be made sure forever before me. Your throne shall be established forever. In accordance with these words and in accordance with all this vision, Nathan spoke to David."}

And the land being at peace. This is talking about how David has now sort of completed that process, right. Of establishing the kingdom in the land. Right. But then it transitions to this other piece. And as we just heard it read in two Samuel, this son who's going to take over for David is speaking pretty literally about Solomon for a couple of reasons. But remember, Saul, as is contrasted here, didn't get to have a dynasty. None of his sons got the throne, so he never had a dynasty. But Solomon is going to. Right? But notice, God says, I'll be to him a father. He shall be to be his son. When he commits iniquity, I'll discipline him with the rod of men, the stripes of the son of man. But my steadfast love will not depart from him as he took it from Saul."}

We're going to talk about that more in a little bit, but not abandon him like David's dynasty will continue. And notice, he says there, your house and your kingdom shall be made sure forever before me, and your throne shall be established forever. But now when we read the parallel passage in 1st Chronicles 17, specifically in verses 13 and 14 the wording is a little bit different."}

So, okay, so here's what it says in First Kings, chapter 11, starting with verse 31. And he said to Jeroboam, Take for yourself 10 pieces. For thus says the Lord, the God of Israel, Behold, I'm about to tear the kingdom from the hand of Solomon and will give you. Give you ten tribes, but he shall have one tribe for the sake of my servant David, for the sake of Jerusalem, the city that I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, because they have forsaken me and worshiped Ashtoreth, the goddess of the Sidonians, Chemash, the God of Moab, and Milcom, the God of the Ammonites. And they have not walked in my ways, doing what is right in my sight and keeping my statutes and my rules, as David his father did. Nevertheless, I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand, but I will make him ruler all the days of his life for the sake of David, my servant, whom I chose, who kept my commandments and my statutes. But I will take the kingdom out of his son's hand, and I will give it, and I will give to it to you 10 tribes. Yet to his son I will give one tribe that David my servant, may always have a lamp before me in Jerusalem, the city where I've chosen to put my name. And I will take you, and you shall reign over all that your soul desires, and you shall be king over Israel. And if you will listen to all that I command you and will walk in my ways and do what is right in my eyes by keeping my statutes and my commandments, as David my servant did, I will be with you and will build you a sure house as I built for David. And I will give Israel to you. And I will afflict the offspring of David because of this. But not forever. Not forever."}

Now, a couple dynasties later, because dynasties turn over fast in the Northern Kingdom due to assassination, they do. A couple dynasties later, Omri is going to establish the Omride dynasty. He's going to be the most famous Israelite king in terms of what we found in archaeology. Other nations refer to Israel during the rest of its brief existence as the House of Omri. Primarily Omri is the one who buys the hill where Samaria is built, which becomes the capital of the Northern Kingdom in Ephraimite territory. But his son Ahab is probably more famous biblically."}

And then also, like, one of the details is it says that there are all these vessels that are. That are inside the temple that are dedicated to baal, yeah. And he has to bring. He does bring them all out, burn it all outside the city, and. And it's all over forever. No, after Josiah dies, very briefly, all that."}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #116 - 2025-05-08 - Kingdoms of Israel - Reckoning","start":8180.6,"end":8328.23,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"I mean, you know, I don't know. I don't know your. Your kinfolk, but I mean, my first thought is to say, well, maybe it's just not a good idea to have that conversation with them, you know, talk about other stuff. But, I mean, so much depends, of course, on the relationship that you actually have. Right. So is it in a place where it could have this? But. But the thought that comes to my mind is that a lot of people who are formed by dispensationalism often have a very strong curiosity about interest in things related to Judaism. And I think that one of the things I remember, for instance, the late Father James Bernstein, who. I mean, as you can tell from his name, he is of Jewish background and the son of a rabbi. Actually, as I recall, you know, he looked at Orthodox Christianity because he first he became an evangelical Christian, and then he became an Orthodox Christian, and then eventually an Orthodox priest. He saw Orthodox Christianity as the fulfillment of the Judaism of his fathers. You know, and I think that one. One potential place that might be fruitful is to show, for instance, how a lot of what's going on in the synagogue and temple find their Christian fulfillment in Orthodox Christianity. I mean, to me, like some of the dispensationalist people, when they start to become interested in tradition and history and so Forth they join these Hebrew roots movements that I'm sure you've probably heard of, which are basically evangelicals imagining things about Judaism and trying to kind of add it into their practice. I mean, that's really what it. What it comes down to, honestly, because it doesn't come from any living tradition. It's this reconstruction sort of thing. And sometimes I look at those people and I'm like, you know, you guys, we're right here. You don't have to come up with something. We got it. It's here. It's right here, you know, so. But I mean, this is your family, so you know them best. And openness to difficult conversations really depends so much on, you know, the relationship itself. Like, what does the relationship really look like? I don't know. Father, do you have any suggestions for conversations with dispensationalists?"}

Like point out those verses in Joshua and just say, you know, that sounds to me like it's saying that. How would you understand that? Right? How does that fit with, you know, and then just leave it there. Just let them think about it and answer however they answer, you know what I mean? And just sort of seed some of those things, you know what I mean? In the sense of like, asking them honest questions, listening to their answer, right?

Because if you try to overturn the whole thing, anybody who. You try to overturn their whole worldview is going to react violently. I mean, not literally, hopefully, but I mean, like, they're going to have a strong counter reaction, right? Whereas if you just sort of, you know, pull out a couple of Jenga blocks, right?

Now it is evident that no one is justified before God by the law, for the righteous shall live by faith. But the law is not of faith. Rather, the one who does them shall live by them.

Right. None of them are receiving the blessings. And so. But Christ is the one who comes and not only redeems the people from those who are the people who are under the Torah for being under its curse. Right.

{"episode_id":"LOS - #116 - 2025-05-08 - Kingdoms of Israel - Reckoning","start":9856.4,"end":10095.73,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Idolatry, sexuality. Right. Like, there's a lot of stuff over. Oh, yeah, you didn't practice the Sabbath year. Right. Like I said, it's on the list. So why is this one being presented here as sort of paradigmatic? The reason this is paradigmatic is that as we've been saying for the last two episodes, the Torah describes a social order. It describes an ordered way of life, an ordered collective way of life for the people of Israel. And as we've also said in both of these last two episodes repeatedly and shown as we've gone through the history that Order that's prescribed by the Torah was never realized in the actual history and life of the people of Israel. And so what this is saying to us, what Jeremiah and Second Chronicles are saying to us, is that they never kept it, they never practiced it, they never followed it. And so God is going to act to establish that order, that in the exile, God is beginning to act to establish that order. And once again, remember the idea of a sign with a prophecy. God says beforehand that it's going to last for 70 years. So then when it does last for 70 years, you can say, ah, God established his order, the order described in the Torah in this one point, then he will certainly act in the future to establish the fullness of that order, the fullness of that way of life. And as we've already seen, that action according to the same Second Chronicles is going to happen through the Messiah. So the expectation as we enter into the exile and beginning the return from the exile, after that 70 years, the expectation is that God is going to intervene and he's going to intervene too. And here's just something we could say more. But number one, to free them from the curse of the Torah, meaning reverse the exile, right? And as part of that, restore Israel. But when he restores Israel, he's going to restore both parts. He's not just going to bring Judah back from exile, but he's also going to somehow restore the northern kingdom. He's going to restore all 12 tribes. In reversing the curse of the Torah, he is going to intervene. He's going to act to establish justice, the justice, the order prescribed by the Torah, meaning he is going to justify his people. He's going to set things right the way they should be, not just tell them, here's how to do it. But he is going to do it. He's going to establish his kingdom forever. Not just provisionally, not just a sign of his kingdom in the earthly kingdom of David, but his actual kingdom forever. And he is going to enthrone the Messiah as king over that kingdom. This is the expectation. And so what we're going to be talking about next episode is going to be how that expectation gets shaped and even transformed over the course of the Second Temple period due to political realities and other things that happen historically. And then how this plays out into the New Testament with the New Testament text being all of them Second Temple Jewish literature."}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #116 - 2025-05-08 - Kingdoms of Israel - Reckoning","start":10109.21,"end":10585.1,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"So. Okay, I'm just wondering, will there be a fourth with a fifth? You never know. But in any event, I, you know, so last episode, in this episode, we quite understandably have done a lot of talk about dispensationalism. And I think it's important not just as a kind of theological punching bag, but because it, at least for people who are listening to us in the English language, as we know that most of you are Americans, although, you know, we had some, some checking in from a number of disparate places throughout the world, and we're very happy to have everybody that dispensationalism has affected a lot of, a lot of religious thinking, Christian thinking in America, and as we mentioned, also even our, our foreign policy. And while it's interesting, of course, to talk about the political ramifications of this theology, what's more important to me is the way that it shapes how we think about the Bible. And this affects people who are not part of dispensationalist denominations or traditions. You know, it's, it's a kind of meme that has made its way into a lot of Christian thinking in the west, and particularly in the United States. And besides the particulars that we've discussed, it also has a kind of structural problem that it imposes on how we see the Scriptures, how we see what it means to be Christian. One of the projects that has been a big, big part of this podcast, and I know especially Father, for your first book, Religion the Apostles, is to show how the Old and the New Testament are really one. That it's really one thing, right? That it's not, okay, there's this religion of the Old Testament and then there's this other religion of the New Testament that are related, but not the same thing. And what dispensationalism does, because it has this idea of a covenant for Jewish people that if they do that, then they can be saved, and then there's a covenant for Christians, and if they do that, then they can be saved. And because of this sort of dividing of the world into eras that are. That is connected to that as well, dispensations that what happens then is there's this kind of sequestering off of big chunks of what is Christian tradition, namely the Old Testament, especially, such that it's all kind of relativized in a certain way, like we talked about reading forwards, reading backwards, you know, earlier. But it almost introduces a kind of crypto, marcionism. And so maybe you've not heard that word before. Marcionism. Marcionism is a heretic of the early church who essentially says that the God of the Old Testament is. This is the creator God and he's wicked. And the father of Jesus Christ in the New Testament is a different God and he's good and loves us and wants to save us from the God of the Old Testament. You can see how ridiculously heretical that is. But you can also see what the implication for not just hermeneutics, but even what constitutes the Scripture. Marcion basically wants to toss out the Old Testament and not surprisingly, he has his own version of the New Testament that that edits out, kind of cuts a lot of the stuff that seems to validate the Old Testament. And even for Christians who will say that they believe everything in the Old Testament, there is often the sense of, okay, well, there's a whole bunch of stuff that's here and it's good and true for this period. And then it gets negated, you know, or replaced or whatever later on for Christians. And, and this is honestly, this is the basis of like we had the one caller who asked about these people who think that, that there needs to be another temple in Jerusalem where they're going to offer up animal sacrifices and it's because of this sort of sequestering off, you know, these elements. Well, that doesn't apply to everybody, but it does apply to these people. To these people, you know, and, you know, we reacted with incredulity to that because shouldn't Jewish people shouldn't is, you know, Israelites, however, you know, whatever. Shouldn't they have Jesus too? Right. To turn to animal sacrifice in another temple is to turn away from Christ. Shouldn't they have Jesus too? Shouldn't they be Christians too? You know, and so it's this fragmentation that's introduced by this view of the scripture that is. Is the problem. It's not. The scripture is not fragmented. It's. It's one. Father Stephen just said that the New Testament is Second Temple Jewish literature. And it's easier to understand perhaps conceptually, maybe because for a lot of people, Second Temple Jewish literature is a relatively newer concept that they may not be familiar with to understand. Okay, this is Jewish as well. Well, the New Testament is a Jewish document, set of documents really. It represents a particular strain of one Judaism, as it were at the time. And that doesn't relativize it, that doesn't demote it by any means, because we explicitly believe this is the one that's true. This is the One that gets everything right. This is the one that is validated by the Messiah himself. Right. That the word of God became flesh and dwelt among us, as St. John says. And so I think, you know, if you're a Christian and you love the scripture, you're putting artificial speed bumps and blocks and, you know, whatever obstructions on your understanding of the Scriptures, if you accept dispensationalist thinking, whether you belong to a dispensationalist denomination or tradition or not, you know, if you say something like, well, that was for the Jews and then this is for Christians, then you're. Then you have accepted on some level, dispensationalist thinking. You know, if you, if you look at the Bible that way. Yes, of course. And we've talked about this in great detail. There are things from the old covenant that get transformed in the new covenant. Covenant, absolutely. But when Jesus says that not one, you know, jot or tittle as it is in, in the good old King James version of the law is going to pass away, he wasn't. He wasn't joking, you know, he wasn't that he really meant that. So that means that all of it is kept. The whole Torah is kept in Christianity. It's not a separate covenant. Right. The new covenant is the transformed old covenant. It is the renewed covenant. And that in that renewal, there are things that change for sure. But it is one. It's all one. As you know, as you like to point out, Father Stephen, St. Paul did not convert to another religion. He's a Pharisee who remained a Pharisee. And he just needed to realize, hold on, hold on. These events have happened that you've always hoped to for as a Pharisee. Oh, so then that means this is happening now, right?"}

So, so important. You know, it. It's honestly like one of the, One of the things I love the most when we did our first Lord of Spirits conferences are there's hundreds of people that showed up to this conference, and they want to know the scriptures. They want to understand the scriptures. That's why they're there. And if you're listening this podcast, you probably. That's. That's what you want. You want to understand the scriptures. That's what we're working on here, right? And so understanding the scriptures, part of that means knowing what these big arcs are and how it all connects. And so that's part of what's going on in this. This series of episodes about the history of Israel is seeing what some of the big overarching narrative arcs are, but also seeing how it's all one. So don't let dispensationalism cut it into pieces for you. It's. It's all one, father."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #116 - 2025-05-08 - Kingdoms of Israel - Reckoning","start":10655.42,"end":10834.45,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"So Carl Bartlett, German theologian writing in the early 20th century, said the great threats to Christianity that were coming along in order would be first, National Socialism, which he saw on the rise in his own country of Germany, followed by communism, followed by Americanism. Guess where we are today. If you've listened to my whole Council of God Bible study on Revelation, this won't shock you as much as it will if you haven't. But frankly, the United States of America is our current incarnation of the Whore of Babylon in the world. Before the early 20th century, it was Britain, so. But now it's the United States of America. And I say this as an American. And the reason for that is that America and Americanism, right, has basically colonized the world, but in a much more subtle way than the British ever did. The British Empire was profoundly unsubtle in its colonization tactics because America doesn't primarily colonize in the sense that they did, like going and taking over countries and making them vassal states, right? And making them all speak American, English, et cetera. America and Americanism tend to colonize the minds of people all over the world. American ideas and ideals, right? And that's shown by how we colonize, right? We colonize by exporting movies and television shows and cultural artifacts and McDonald's and good old capitalism and Coca Cola all over the world. Mickey Mouse. And the most deeply colonized people by Americanism, of course, are Americans. We're the ones on whom the job has been done most thoroughly. And so we approach things as Americans from the perspective of American values. I have sat in graduate school classes and had biblical studies professors argue to me that Genesis describes the separation of church and state, that when Judges says, in those days there was no king and everyone did what was right in his own eyes, that was a good thing. They have argued to me, because king's bad."}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #116 - 2025-05-08 - Kingdoms of Israel - Reckoning","start":10842.17,"end":11196.76,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"At least minarchism, right? Minimum possible government, so everyone can do their own thing. Those are kind of egregious examples of sort of importing this whole American worldview into the scriptures as we read them. But American forms of Christianity have also colonized a lot of Christianity and dispensationalism. No, no less than the others, certainly in some of its views. And so, I mean, I started out this episode by calling a bunch of people blasphemers. But you'll notice I said they weren't intending to be blasphemers, just believe something they were taught by someone else who believed it because they were taught it, right? And it's just ingrained. It's an ingrained idea. We've criticized some other views over the course of this episode, and they're just these ingrained ideas that are in our heads. And so when we look at the scriptures, we see them. If we look at a passage that seems to contradict them, oh, that's a tough passage. The ones that we can read in a way that are commensurate with those ideas, we're like, oh, there's an easy passage. Well, we'll interpret everything in light of that. And we don't realize just how much we've been shaped. If you want to understand the scriptures, if you're ever reading and studying the scriptures and you don't feel like you're in a foreign country, you don't feel a sense of uncanniness, a sense of strangeness, you don't feel like you've left your comfortable day to day American or quasi American or depending on who's listening, right? First World Western, whatever we want to say, lifestyle, and gone to someplace different, another place, another time, another culture, another way of looking at the world, another set of values. Then you're not really reading the Bible. You're reading the traditions, the ways of thought, the ideas that have colonized your own mind. And you're just sort of caught in this circle, in this cycle that's hard to break, but the only way to break it is to step outside of it. One of the reasons, right, there's always madness to my method, right? One of the reasons why I sometimes put things in the most, maybe not the most, but in more shocking ways than are necessary on this show. Maybe a little more jolting or emphatic than they need to be, is to try to help with this, right? To try to really help somebody who wants to get out of the vicious cycle of reading in, maybe jolt them out of it a little bit, Maybe break a few things, right? To make things get cleaned up and reorganized. I'm honestly trying to help. My intentions are good, outcomes may vary, but that's where we need to go. We should always feel, as I said when we're studying the Scriptures, like we're in a foreign land, we're in a different place, A place where we're kind of a stranger. And we're trying to understand and we're trying to enculturate ourselves and we're trying to fit into this other way of thinking and this other way of being, this other way of seeing. And the same thing is true. Same thing is true when we go to church. Same thing is true when we're in liturgical services, when we're entering into the Kingdom of Heaven. If that doesn't feel like a little bit of a foreign country to us, if that doesn't feel a little strange, if it doesn't feel like we don't quite fit and we're going to need to change and we're going to need to acculturate ourselves and we're going to need to learn new language and new ways of talking and thinking in order to fit, then that means we haven't left home, that we're still stuck in the place where we started. I don't think from how I started this that I think America is exceptionally bad. I don't. I don't think it's any worse than Britain, right? Just our numbers up right now. I don't think it's any worse than any other country. But I do think that, like every country in this world, it is a foreign country to the Kingdom of God. I do think that it is not the kingdom, it is not becoming the kingdom, and it is not going to become the kingdom. Neither is the nation state of Israel or any other country on this earth. So I hope that maybe one of the things we do on this show, by breaking up settled notions of this kind of thing, like in these last couple and in our next episode, by breaking up a lot of these settled notions, hopefully, at least for some folks who want to try to get there, it'll help restore that sense of uncanniness, that sense of not at homeness."}
