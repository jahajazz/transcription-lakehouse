And he will be the light of the nations and the hope of those whose hearts are troubled. All who dwell on the earth will fall down and worship him. And they will praise and bless and celebrate with song the lord of spirits. First Enoch, chapter 48, verses 4 through 5. The modern world doesn't acknowledge, but is nevertheless haunted by spirits, angels, demons and saints. In our time, many yearn to break free of the prison of a flat secular materialism, to see and to know reality as it truly is. What is this spiritual reality like? How do we engage with it? Well, how do we permeate everyday life with spiritual presence? Orthodox Christian priests Father Andrew Stephen Damick and Father Stephen DeYoung host this live call in show focused on enchantment in creation, the. The union of the seen and unseen as made by God and experienced by mankind throughout history. Welcome to the Lord of Spirits."}

Well, anyway, tonight we're talking about technology. This is something a lot of you people have asked us about. And even though it's been discussed every so often in a number of episodes, we've never dedicated a whole episode to it and taken that deep dive that I know a lot of you are ready for. Now, some of our listeners may not remember this, but surely Father Stephen and I remember in 1997 when Skynet became self aware and launched its war against the human race. It was tough for a few years there, but later LiveJournal and MySpace saved us, so that's done. That said, here in 2023, people are perhaps more addicted to technology and also more afraid of it than ever before, or at least in recent memory. Will AI take over? What happens when the robotic police force comes online? Are we living in the Matrix? Have you or someone you know been assimilated into the Borg Collective already? Is transporter technology, in fact a Class 1 impossibility? For the answers to all these questions, you will have to listen to some other podcast. So what are we talking about anyway, Father?"}

But as usual, we're going to start in some somewhat rarefied air. Not in the Neolithic era. We'll start getting back there in the second half, but in the first half. We're actually starting kind of with an earlier episode of the podcast because we need to go back and review a little. As Stan Lee used to insist at Marvel, every issue is somebody's first issue."}

Right. Like, you could do that, but you'd have to memorize all the episode numbers so that you could cross reference those back. So I think it's easier to just review. I don't know."}

I don't know who you were, but now I'll never know. So technically, is one way of knowing, amongst others, that we talked about in that episode.

The noose receives primarily thoughts, but also potentially images, visions. Right. What have you from spiritual reality.

So not patterns in the sense of. That we talk about, like scientific laws or something. But just in the way that things work, being able to see those patterns and then apply them to day to day life.

And, you know, it's funny, like, I've noticed that sometimes people, I think, are hesitant to think of idolatry and sacrifice to gods as being technology. And I think that's because our modern experience of quote, unquote, religion is that it's this special thing you do maybe one day a week. Right. It's this special thing you do. Right. But I.

And so here's the thing that's interesting about reading the Iliad, which. It's been a long time since I've read it, so I really recommend this to everybody, actually, and the recommending."}

The Robert Fagels translation is great. But one of the things that's interesting in this regard about that is almost any time one of the characters, one of these heroes, decides he's going to go and take on his enemies, or he sees them coming at him or whatever it is, almost every time they will offer up a sacrifice. It's constant. I have lost count of how many sacrifices have been offered in the maybe four or five days that have taken place in the events that I've been reading. There's a lot of them, and some of them, it's, you know, the full barbecue. Right. And I mean, literally, it's talking about how juicy it is and all this kind of stuff. But in other case. In many other cases, it's, you know, they're filling up their cups with wine but they always pour out a few drops or sometimes the whole cup to Zeus or whoever. Right. So it's not special, it's instrumental. It's like we're about to do this thing. We need this. We, we want Zeus to come in. We want, although Zeus mostly likes to sit on his throne and laugh at everybody killing each other. You know, we want Athena to show up. We want Poseidon, we want Ares, we want Aphrodite."}

It's very tactical and strategic, these constant offering of sacrifices. So I mean, if you want to see this sense of instrumentality in terms of sacrifice, read the Iliad. Really? I mean, it's again, I've lost count of how many sacrifices have happened and I'm 60% of the way through."}

And so when you start using techne, some people may have, may already be ahead of at least where we're talking here. They may be thinking, well, you can not only approach like a rock or a hammer or a piece of wood or a block of marble that you're going to sculpt or a book you're going to write or a concept you're developing, you may not only approach that in this sort of instrumental way, in this, this way of techne. But as we were just saying, you could kind of approach spiritual entities that way and you could also approach people that way."}

How can I use this person to accomplish some goal? Right. And then you can instrumentalize other things like ideas Feelings, emotions, right. You can instrumentalize those things to try to get that person to do the things you want. Right. To accomplish the goal. And so when this mode of techne is applied to humans, to spiritual or divine beings, it is innately depersonalizing and dehumanizing. Right. You are treating that person in the way that you would treat an object in the world. You are treating them as a object in which you can manipulate and put into place."}

So they would talk about fatalistic might be better in the classical Greek sense. But there is a sense in which everything becomes compelled and everything becomes instrumental and therefore free will starts to depart from the picture. Right. And as we move into the modern period and the spiritual realm gets sort of cut. Lopped off, either separated out, so it's irrelevant to the world or denied outright later on, this becomes a kind of materialist determinism. So I know we have some listeners at least, who are at least around in contemporary philosophical circles. This is the cause du jour is, hey, can any philosopher out there come up with a way that anyone can have anything like free will?"}

Right. In the modern world, our atheist friends, there's not even that. And so you can know more for the Majority. The majority opinion among philosophers now, I think I can safely say is that there is no free will and therefore you can no more decide what you're going to do any given day than a domino can decide which direction it's going to fall. And that's it. That's everything. Right. Everything is techne. So, yeah. So I. I didn't say this was going to be a happy episode with a feel good ending. I never said that."}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #082 - 2023-12-14 - The Art and Science of Technomancy","start":4076.64,"end":4150.56,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Where hopefully this is not a deck building question, because I'm not really. Yeah, thank you fathers for having me. So, yeah, my question is tangutively related to both, I think, techne and magic. And I hope I phrase this correctly, but in a previous episode it was mentioned, if I understood correctly, that magic was understood as a way to sort of force the gods to do what you wanted them to do. And it was using, you know, a certain formula. So what? I guess my question has two parts. How would you explicitly differentiate magic from techne? And then also connected to the formula aspect, what differentiates? I guess the eucharistic prayer in divine liturgy, since it uses the same phrasing on a weekly basis. Like how would you differentiate that from magic since we're, you know, attempting to get God to bless, you know, our offering every week."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #082 - 2023-12-14 - The Art and Science of Technomancy","start":4151.36,"end":4341.4,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Yeah, well, okay, so there's a couple things I'll say. Number one, magic is a subset of techni, so it's a particular kind of instrumentalization. Okay. And the point is that if you do it right, then you always get a certain result. It may involve trying to force gods to do stuff, but it may not. It also may be just sort of about, you know, manipulating the elements of the world, you know, that kind of thing. And yeah, this is a good question you ask about the Eucharist, Right. Because I think especially for those of us who, even if we don't have a Protestant background, we live in a Protestant country in a lot of ways, or at least a country with what's left of a Protestant culture maybe. And at least American Protestantism is not that ritualistic in its worship, so it tends to present itself in A much more kind of informal way. Right. And so therefore, when you see complex worship, people sometimes look at that and say, you're doing magical spells. Right. Because of the complexity of it. Right. But here's the really important thing. Just because there's a complex method to something does not make it magic. Magic is about guaranteed results and about the actions themselves doing the thing. The Eucharist is explicitly a request, a prayer to God to do something. Right. He does not have to do it now. He is the one who himself gave it. I mean, we see that in the Gospels. He gives the Eucharist to us to do and commands us to do it. So this is not something that we dreamed up to, to make, to force God to do anything. This is something he gave us to do, something he is doing that he's inviting us to participate in and tells us how to do that. Right. So it's not magic because it doesn't happen because the, the priest does the technique. Right. Which is why, for instance, variations between Eucharistic liturgies that exist between traditions or sometimes represent completely other rituals. Right. So the, the, the Eucharistic liturgy of the Byzantine tradition is quite different from the Eucharistic liturgy of the Latin tradition. Even prior to the Great Schism, they were quite different from each other, and yet they still both were. The Eucharist, if it was magic, then the technique would need to be essentially the same. Right? Because if you're going to get the thing to do what you want it to do, you have to follow the recipe. That's how it, how it works. Right. So yeah, it's, it's about prayer, asking God to act. It's not about making God do anything. As if we could. Right. That's not a thing. You can't force God to do anything. So that's what I would have to say about that. I don't know. Father, you got anything to add or adjust or Actually."}

So now I'm talking in the general sense. So sacrificial worship in the general sense, which includes the Eucharist, includes pagan animal offerings, includes sacrifices in the Old Testament. Right. Sacrifice, broadly, has always included within it the idea, this is what differentiates it from magic, that the God can reject the sacrifice. And this was literally institutionalized in the ancient pagan world. This is why you would have a haruspex. A haruspex is somebody haruspex is the Latin word. But this kind of activity predates Rome by a lot in the ancient Aries. But harvespex is. Is a particular type of priest who practiced ecstasy, which is the reading of the entrails of a sacrificed animal. So his whole job. And we have, like, mocked up kidneys and lungs and things that have inscriptions on them, like made of stone with inscriptions in them that were used to train heruspexes, haruspices, I guess, in their. In their art form. So after the animal was sacrificed, they would go in and get into the guts of the animal, literally, and look for signs as to whether the God had accepted the sacrifice or not. Right. And so if they found, you know, black spots on certain organs, or we have records in some cases of organs being missing. Right. They go in there and one of the major organs, like a heart in one case is missing. This was taken as this horrible omen that, oh, no, the gods have rejected this sacrifice. Right. And then you would have to come up with some other actions to figure out why and then to try to, you know, offer more sacrifices and get them back on your side. Now, obviously, we as Christians don't do all that activity, but the existence of that and the prevalence of that shows that unlike magic, there is this possibility that even if you do everything right. Right. It might not work. Which means that the divine still has its agency. Right. In the Old Testament, we find this. It gets to the point of the prophets where God tells them to stop offering the sacrifices because he says, your hearts are far from me, you're behaving however you want. And then coming and offering sacrifices like that makes it okay, Like I have to then forgive you even though you're not repentant. Right. That's not how this works. Right. So God makes clear through his prophets of the Old Testament that he retains his autonomy. Right. Sacrifice does not operate in this mechanistic way and even within some of the prayers of the Eucharist. So, for example, in the Liturgy of St. Basil the Great, I pray a prayer. It's often done silently, so everyone may not hear it, but I pray a prayer asking God not to withhold the grace of the Holy Spirit from the gifts because of my sins as a priest."}

What I'm about to say is not me taking a cheap shot at our Roman Catholic friends. It is me trying to avoid taking a cheap shot at our Roman Catholic friends. I think this would be a worthwhile question about the Eucharist to ask to an informed Roman Catholic person because I know the whole hocus pocus thing. I know they have a good answer for that. I am not the person equipped to answer that for them and explain the difference from their perspective because there is very much within the Roman Catholic theology of ordination and how they see that as working and the charisms granted to a priest, a kind of mechanistic view of this, where if he grabs bread and wine and says the words of institution, they automatically become the body and blood of Christ. You could find theological statements that talk about the Roman Catholic priest reaching up into heaven and compelling Christ to come down. So that would be a good question to ask them. I'm sure there are answers from a Roman Catholic perspective. I'm not the one equipped to give them, and so I don't want to caricature them here. Right.

A tapa or Adapa and his buds, who are, as we've talked about before, starting with Adapa, who's a sort of a fish person, supernatural being who emerges from the rivers, comes, and he's called a sage because he comes in, he imparts wisdom to the rulers. He's followed by six other sages. When you look at kings lists from this period, right. The kings before the flood have these Apkalu, these sages, as their advisors. Right. And that's sort of why they are able to become king. They have this wisdom from the spiritual realm, from these spiritual beings. And then, as we've talked about before, after the flood, the kings are said to be two thirds apkallu, that there's this sort of interbreeding represented right within the story. But the Apkallu proper from before the flood, they end up imprisoned beneath the rivers in the abyss by the gods for having given this knowledge to man. But the importance of the function of this story in the middle of the second millennium BC for the Babylonian empire. This Babylonian empire was established by the Amuru, which literally means the Westerners. They came from what's now Syria, Hammurabi being the most famous one who's a king during this period. They used this story in large part to justify their own reign in that they claimed to still have this secret wisdom."}

Yeah. And I mean, other mythic traditions have gods who function in some of these ways of giving knowledge to mankind. Secret knowledge. Right. And there's different versions of it, but, like, none of them are quite exactly Prometheus. But I mean, it's a lot of. It's just variations on a theme. But one of the things that's interesting to me is the kind of the second tier of this that you get especially in, like, you get in Germanic mythology, particularly, which, again, you know, reminder everybody. Germanic mythology comes to us through Christians who wrote it down, often centuries after the last pagan in their area was baptized. Right. You know, the last great pagan tradition get baptized. And so, you know, so it's mediated through that. And so what you get then is sort of these lesser spiritual beings, not Titans or whatever, right? These kind of lesser spiritual beings who have knowledge, but it's often not in terms of, like, giving knowledge to people so that they can rule, but rather providing them with cool stuff. And so that's where you get this whole realm of, like, smith gods."}

And in Germanic paganism, he's often the guy who makes whatever impressive sword or bit of armor that's around in the story, is often said to be from Wayland, that he's the guy who made that, or Veeland, depending on where you are, or volund, you know, same guy. But then you also get, like, dwarves, you know, again, like, they're making magical stuff, especially magical weapons. But then you also get like, Weyland, for instance, becomes a tutorial figure. Like, gods will send their sons to him to go so they can learn stuff from him. So he still functions in that same way. But this idea, right, of the kind of the divine mediator of technology is still a thing, even though now it's kind of demoted a little bit within some of these more marginal mythologies. And by marginal, I don't mean that they're not important. I mean marginal in the sense of, like, being long distance away from the ancient near east where we. Where the Bible arises and so forth.

I am happy to announce the release of my new book, when you Give Ancient Answers and Contemporary Questions. In this companion volume to when you Pray and when youn Fast, I juxtapose scriptural and patristic admonitions about almsgiving with a look at contemporary issues that make it sometimes difficult to see our way forward. In this regard, along with the rationale for almsgiving, I offer practical suggestions for how almsgiving can work in our lives as modern Christians.

And this, you know, to link back to one of our major themes, but also a particular episode about what a spirit is, you know, a spirit and especially the Holy Spirit who animates the church is, you know, it's this Spirit that animates a people, that animates a group or sometimes an individual. But, you know, in talking about holy tradition, it is this overall historical unfolding, but it's not a deterministic unfolding. Like it's God himself is working. He has agency. He's doing all this. And sometimes, you know, a lot of the time we cannot see what he's doing. Right. There's, I mean, like, just to think about it on an individual level. Not that we're talking about it on the individual level, but we do experiencing it on an individual level. Like some, for instance, if someone has had a true conversion to Christ and a lot of you listening to this have had a true Conversion to Christ, you probably could not have predicted that five, 10 years, maybe one year before that happened. And it's only in retrospect that you look back on your life and see how it was leading in that direction. Right. That the narrative is something that's done, that's apparent in retrospect, but not in the moment. Well, this is fractal. And it's not like God is like, well, I'm working on this guy right now and I'll take care of the rest. Like, no, God is God. So he's working on every level, always everywhere, all the time.

There's no point in really telling that story. I am who I am now. Right. That's the result of it. Right. But yeah, and this is true on this macro level. Right. So tradition is not. Christ told the apostles a bunch of other stuff. He said, hey, don't write this down. Just when you ordain bishops later, kind of whisper it in their ear and they'll pass it on to the next group. And so each generation of bishops has sort of passed on the secret knowledge. That's called Gnosticism."}

I mean, one thing I think that's important to point out is that human beings are fundamentally permeable, which means that the isolation itself that we're using our technology for is actually, on a certain level, an illusion. Right. We're still permeable. We're spiritually permeable. And I think a lot of the times the isolation that we're using our technology for is an attempt to escape that. But it. It creates this feedback loop. I heard. I was listening to something earlier today, and they were talking about feedback loops in terms of bad behavior. And like, one of the things, you know, was said was, well, if you want to get depressed when you're sad, isolate yourself, and then that'll take you, you know, into depression, you know, and. But the. The reality is that we're still permeable. Right? So you can. You can. You can put yourself within a hard bubble, but it's not really. You're still permeable to spiritual reality. And so one of the things that happens when you isolate yourself from your fellow humans, especially when you. When you isolate yourself from your fellow Christians, is that you're going to be permeable to other spirits. So that's a thing that's happening. Right? And I think that's one thing that's important for us to know is that the more that we try to craft the perfectly customized life, the more that we are going into very dangerous territory. And I think, especially for Americans, that's a constant, constant, constant temptation. We have to be vigilant and always correcting, always, you know, don't believe me. Go to any Store that sells candy. I remember when there was one kind of KitKat. I don't know how many there are now. Like, I cannot tell you. There is always some new combination or new version or whatever. And like, I'm not saying, you know, don't have your, you know, mint chocolate Kit Kats or whatever. I'm just like, think about what it does when you're constantly looking for more choices and more variety and whatever, right? So the other thing is, another thing is that, like, I definitely agree with the idea that as a, as a race, we're doing a lot of bad things with technology. Right? And yet at the same time, as you said, you noted the irony. Here we are on the Internet. I mean, this show is possible because of the Internet. You're in Louisiana, I'm in Pennsylvania. People, we had people first. There was a guy from London who said he was listening, a guy from Uruguay, someone from Kentucky, some from Oklahoma. There's people, people all over the world. And the reason they're able to listen to it is because of the Internet, right? That's a reality. And God willing, they're getting a benefit out of it. I don't think that that makes the way that a lot of this media fundamentally works completely okay. But at the same time, you know, as, as a, as a preacher, as a priest, as an evangelist, as a Christian, I know that everything that I do is going to be at least partly bad, you know, So I have to decide, okay, in what way am I going to participate in this world to try to do the most good, knowing full well that I'm compromised? Because that's just a reality, right? I can't live in any other way. We're all compromising on one level or another. So the question is, how can I do the most good and how can I repent as much as possible, right? So, I mean, I do think that I do believe. I mean, if I didn't believe this, I wouldn't be working the job that I do, that the technology can be used for good. And including Internet, technology can be used for good. I see it in many ways as being missionaries in the marketplace. Marketplace has always been a place of lots of temptations and a lot of bad things going on. There is the possibility of being a missionary in that marketplace, but I think it also requires an asceticism, an asceticism of attention. And this is how we get to begin to develop a maturity with relation to these capabilities, right? So then the final thing I'll say is that all of this That I just said, literally all of it is why we always make the point on this program. And I always make the point on all the work that I do. Really, all the public work that I do is about aiming people back to 3D parish life, right? Like, and if you're doing that, if you're really doing it in a very, very dedicated way, you don't need any of the stuff that we're doing. You don't need it, right? The point of this is not to point you back to us. Like, if I say, hey, buy my book, or, hey, listen to this thing, or, hey, you know, whatever. It's not because I want you to pay attention to me. It's not about me. It's about the things that we're talking about, which, God willing, will aim you towards a life of real repentance in 3D parish life. Or if you're a monastic, in the monastery, which might sound weird to point that out, but actually, I have met monks that listen to ancient faith radio. When I was on Mount Athos five and a half years ago, I met a monk who listened to ancient faith radio. I was kind of stunned. Kind of stunned, but it's a thing. But it really is about pointing people back to that, because that's what the Christian life is. It's this life of worship and almsgiving and community and repentance and love and family, all of these things that you don't need any of this stuff to do. But if you're out here in this marketplace with us, we're going to be pointing you in that direction. That's always the point, you know, if. If. I mean, it's great if, you know, it's fine if people want to listen, like, oh, that's weird. Interesting, cool stuff. Like, but. But this should not be a hobby, right? These things that we're talking about should not be a hobby. This should be. This should be life. It should be life. So that's how I parse through a lot of this. These very difficult questions is like, yeah, we're. On some level, it's always going to be imperfect and maybe even leaning very in the imperfect direction. But still, we can. We can point people back to Christ. Father STEPHEN."}

Ultimately, what it is is a removal of freedom. Part of the problem is that we've been taught to think of freedom in the wrong way. Because we've been taught to think of freedom as individuality. This is another one of those feedback loops. Freedom is individuality, meaning freedom is, I can go and dye my hair some unnatural color that nobody else's hair has dyed. I can go and buy. I can go and buy guns. I can go and buy drugs. I can go and do this. I can go and do that. This makes me free. None of that is freedom. Freedom in terms of the scriptures, in terms of the teachings of Christianity. Freedom is freedom to serve the living God and thereby freedom to flourish. Freedom to be human. Freedom to become the person God created you to be. And you can't do that as an individual. Humans can't exist alone. Even Aristotle knew that, and he was a pagan. Humans have to exist in community. To be human. You have to be in a community. That's where you become free. Free to flourish. But again, what we've been talking about tonight implies what it is that we need to become free from. Once again, there are people and powers, sometimes powers behind people who have instrumentalized ideas in order to instrumentalize us, in order to dehumanize us and enslave us. And I'm super glad that we have a disclaimer in front of the show now, because I can say things like what I'm about to say. I probably would anyway, but okay. Palestinian people need to be free. Not free to be individuals, not free to eat McDonald's. They need to be free to flourish as humans. The only way they can do that is to cast off the ideas their masters have used to enslave them. Israeli people need to be free. The only way for them to be free is to cast off the ideas, the fear, the racial animosity, the pride that have been used against them to enslave them. Israeli people and Palestinian people will become free when they become free together by throwing off their masters who have pitted them against each other to their own destruction. You say the same thing about Ukrainian people and Russian people, but you can say the same thing about Norwegian people, about American people, about Australian people, Chinese people, Brazilian people. We are currently doing things that we don't really want to do, that are making our lives worse, that are alienating us, that we've been tricked into doing by a prolonged indoctrination in certain ideas. Lying to us about where our happiness lies, lying to us about what we need to be afraid of, lying to us about other people to keep us separated from them and isolated and alone, which makes us better prey for the ideas that the people and the powers that have become our masters want us to do. I'm going to end up in a similar place to where Father Andrew did. Because the way out of this, the way to be free, we have to be free in a community. We have to be free with other people. And frankly, the only place we can do this now is in our parishes. The only place we can do this now is the church. There's not another spot to start building a community from even if we wanted to."}

And I often use leadership here loosely. Look at what we're receiving from the media. Look at it and collectively together as a community, say, you know what? No, we're not going to do that. We're going to stop buying things. Not particular things, not. I'm going to boycott these people because they did. Xyz. You know what? We don't need to buy so many things. I'm not defined. My identity isn't defined by what I consume. That's a dumb idea. This person isn't different from me. And I don't need to be fundamentally different from me. And I don't need to be afraid of them because they're from a different neighborhood, they immigrated from a different country, they look different, they act different, they smell different, doesn't matter. We can come together and collectively say that as a community. And when we do, we will become free. We'll experience freedom. We'll experience more of the fullness of our humanity. We'll be emboldened. We'll be empowered to get about the work that God created for us to do in this world. Being set free from sin to serve the living God is not just something that happened in Egypt under Moses."}

It's something that happens, has to happen for each of us. And as many times as we allow ourselves to become enslaved again, we need to be set free again. Because one of the most important powers that Christ has given to us when he gave us the Holy Spirit, is the power to break those chains of ideology, of thoughts that bind us and try and hold us in that kind of slavery. So that's my final thought, is that all of us need to free ourselves. And we do that together. And we do that by rejecting the thoughts, the ideas, the ideologies that are currently keeping us from doing that and keeping us from being human together."}
