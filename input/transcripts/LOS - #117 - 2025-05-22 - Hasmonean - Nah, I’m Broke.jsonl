And he will be the light of the nations and the hope of those whose hearts are troubled. All who dwell on the earth will fall down and worship him. And they will praise and bless and celebrate with song the lord of spirits. First Enoch, chapter 48, verses 4 through 5. The modern world doesn't acknowledge, but is nevertheless haunted by spirits, angels, demons and saints. In our time, many yearn to break free of the prison of a flat secular materialism, to see and to know reality as it truly is. What is this spiritual reality like? How do we engage with it? Well, how do we permeate everyday life with spiritual presence? Orthodox Christian priests, Father Andrew Stephen Damick and Fr. Stephen DeYoung host this live call in show focused on enchantment in creation, the union of the seen and unseen as made by God and experienced by mankind throughout history.

So obviously the history, regardless your perspective on the canon of scripture, without going down that rabbit hole too far, obviously the history of Israel continued. Right.

Would finally be fulfilled. Right. What were they expecting to happen? What were they expecting to change? What were they expecting to come?

And who is a descendant of David. And he is going to. That intervention through the Messianic king is going to establish his kingdom. It's going to establish justice. The justice described in The Torah, it's going to restore Israel, both the northern and southern kingdoms. And we'll get into that more as we go on tonight and free the people from the curse of the Torah. Remember the curse that's literally the curses enunciated in the Torah for not having kept it. Yeah, right. Under which the people were languishing in exile. So this is. This is what they're hoping for. This is what they're expecting to come. And now we begin tonight with tonight the harrowing conclusion. Um, we're going to. Sorry, what. Okay, so what actually happens now? This is their expectation. How does history sort of unfold? So Judah had been taken in. We talked more about the Assyrians last time, but Judah had been taken into exile by actually the Neo Babylonian Empire. We just refer to Babylon, but remember, they're the Neo Babylonian Empire. They're the New Babylonian empire in the 6th century BC because."}

And the original Babylonian empire, this is Hammurabi and the Amuru. This is back in the Bronze Age, that fell apart in the Bronze Age collapse. So this is the Neo Babylonian Empire, which is begun by Nabopolasser. Babylon becomes ascended again. He begins to take action, move toward conquering Nineveh, then the Assyrian Empire, and then going from there.

But the Neo Babylonian empire, as glorious as it may have been, did not last very long. This is another one of those time frame things we talked about. The Relatively small period of time that Israel and Judah existed in the world. The Neo Babylonian Empire was around for about a century. That was about it.

He doesn't, just, he, he does not operate according to the kind of principles the Assyrians or even the Babylonians used. He's, he's great at making deals. Oh, so he goes to the tribes of the Medes.

One of the things that facilitates this is he's very good, very good at administration. He creates a massive bureaucratic state. He standardizes what's called Imperial Aramaic, the language that we think of as Aramaic, that parts of the Hebrew Bible are actually written in like big chunks of Daniel and Ezra. That Aramaic is Imperial Aramaic. That is the standardized language of the Persian Empire."}

That language around an Aramaic over into, like I said, Pakistan, India, over in that direction. So Cyrus's character here becomes very important. Right. So Cyrus takes a very different approach to the people under his rule, whether conquered or bargained for or treated with or however they ended up part of the Persian Empire. Famously, he would send emissaries, Right. This is the whole scene in 300, which obviously is not a super realistic portrayal, but some of the basic facts are correct in that he would send emissaries, Right. With salt and with things.

You know, oh, here's all the goosey surrender and he gets kicked down the well. Right. Like the famous scene. Yeah. So the Greeks kind of started that, but on the other hand, they were kind of being extorted at the same time. But even that gives you a view that Cyrus and his successors had a different. Had a different maybe and maybe even, we might say, more practical approach to expanding and governing their empire. Right. It wasn't about conquest and defeat and grinding people's faces into the ground like the Assyrians. And they didn't. And Cyrus didn't feel the need to sort of expunge all of the different people groups, Right. As long as they submitted to his authority, that was fine."}

I mean, I don't know a huge amount about this, but a little bit about what they call the priestless old believers from Russian Orthodox history. Well, they still exist, that they believe that God takes away the priesthood from the world because of sin and the end of the world is coming and so forth, and yet they continue to do church services without priests. So it's essentially a series of reader services. But. But then they still have to do things like baptize people and marry people, and so they kind of develop ways of doing that that sort of still acknowledge that the priesthood is missing.

But Paul operated during his entire life as a faithful Pharisee within the Roman Jewish world. In St. Paul the Pharisee, Jewish apostle to all nations, Father Stephen DeYoung surveys Paul's life and writings, interpreting them within the holy tradition of the Orthodox Church. This survey is followed by DeYoung's interpretive translation of St. Paul's epistles, which deliberately avoids overly familiar terminology. By using words and ideas grounded in 1st century Judaism, DeYoung hopes to unsettle commonly held notions and help the reader reassess St. Paul in his historical context.

There are different groups, right? There's the four caves, right? There's the, the. The righteous who are going to be taken into paradise. There's the, the martyrs who are going to receive special rewards, starting with Abel. There are the wicked who are going to get tossed into the lake of fire. And there are the sort of ignorant. Right, that's your sort of limbo group who are just going to stay in Hades and Sheol forever. And so there was already this kind of idea.

I do my parish Bible study that gets recorded and sent out eventually as the whole Council of God podcast. Right. So I know it's somewhere in Exodus and what they're posting, but last night, in real time, we're in the Book of Numbers, so we're way ahead.

It says the same thing, like five times, just to make sure you understand what it's saying. Says that the Levites are all gathered together, and then all the other people from the other tribes are gathered. The people from the other tribes lay their hands on the Levites and offer them as a peace offering to God on behalf of all the people and their sins. Right? Now, if you want to read that through the lens of psa, you would imagine what they took the Levites and beat them to death. Right. Like they laid hands on the Levites to transfer their sins onto them, and then they took them and punished them for those sins and they're forgiven. Right. That doesn't work in the text. Right. What the text is clearly saying is the peace offering is we are giving these people, out of all the people, these people we are giving to God to spend their lives serving God as living sacrifices like St. Paul talks about. Right. Penal substitution just doesn't work there. And so I've started by telling people, go through the Old Testament, find me one place where sins are put on an animal and then it's sacrificed.

But then they don't have to deal with all of the other stuff in the scriptures that are often being referenced by whatever the passage that they just brought up actually is.

Yeah, so it's a callback to a specific place in the Old Testament that happens long after Jacob and Esau, the men are dead. It's about their descendants. So the idea that, you know, God loves Jacob and he hates Esau is not supportable in the actual Jacob Esau story. But you know, when the Edomites rebel against the Israelites, Jacob have I loved Esau, have I hated Israel? In other words, Israel I've loved, Edom I've hated. That makes way more sense when you realize it's about those groups of people and it's about a specific action that the Edomites took. You know, so that's just another example like when these things are taken out of context. And the sad thing is is that stuff gets taken out of context and then gets repeated for over and over and over again centuries. And people just receive and accept that that's how you're supposed to read that passage and they forget that it's actually that the Bible itself is very, to use a modern term, hypertextual. Everything links to everything else and if you cut all the links then you're going to interpret it the wrong way, you know, does it make sense?"}

The covenant of Abraham and how we fall into that as Christians. And coming off of watching West Huff and hearing all the discussions on. On what he was talking about of can people that are not be Christians be saved? And that. And then same thing. When I watched Jordan Peterson seminar, every. The same question was kind of coming up with all the non Christians and, and Jonathan Pageau had to kind of say like, yeah, you can experience salvation, but the church is really important. So my question is, what is the difference? I guess I can understand that outside of Christianity, people can experience salvation as it is of being freed from our sins. But I guess the question is what, what. What's the difference between salvation as a Christian and salvation not as a Christian, that even. If that even is a thing."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #117 - 2025-05-22 - Hasmonean - Nah, I’m Broke","start":4732.61,"end":4839.07,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Yeah. I mean, there's only one salvation, right? I mean, to be saved is to become. I mean, as. As Christ said in one of my favorite verses, sons of the resurrection, sons of God, equal to the angels. Right? That's what salvation is. That's the destination of salvation. But it's. But I shouldn't say destination, really, because it's. It is a continuum, right? So you can be saved more and more, you can become more and more, you know, one of the sons of God, more and more like Christ. Right. And so the Christianity, what that gives us is the straight, clear path of exactly how to do that, right? That is the full puzzle with all the pieces, right? That is what orthodox Christianity is. Does that mean that someone who has. Who does not have all the pieces that, like, oh, sorry, you didn't get that last corner piece in. So go directly to hell, do not pass purgatory, do not collect $200, you know. No, it does not mean that, because. And part of the way we know this, I think. I mean, I think. I hope eventually we will do maybe a dedicated episode on this question of people outside of. Outside of Israel in one way or another, because it's connected to actually some of what we're talking about tonight. But, like, the example I like to give is the book of Jonah, where the prophet, he sent by God to Nineveh. So this is the Assyrians. And of course, if you've been listening this up, this series, you know that the Assyrians are the worst people on earth at that point. Pretty much."}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #117 - 2025-05-22 - Hasmonean - Nah, I’m Broke","start":4840.39,"end":5015.84,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Yes, very, very. I mean, just horrifying, horrifying people. And so it's understandable that Jonah, when God sends Jonah to them, he's like, no, I don't want to go there. You might have mercy on them. I don't want to go there and be your instrument of mercy on the Assyrians. Like, those guys are the worst, you know? And of course, we know how it turns out. He sent God, makes him go. Basically, he finally does go, and he. He preaches that. That Nineveh is going to be overthrown. And then they repent and God spares them. And then Jesus himself in the Gospels, holds up the men of Nineveh as a witness against the people of. Against the Judeans, Right? And that they will rise up and stand in judgment of. Of, you know, the generation that's with him there. So what does that mean? I mean, the, you know, the Ninevites, the Assyrians, these are demon worshiping pagans. And there's no indic. It's not, you know, the book of Jonah does not end with, and they all stopped worshiping their gods and began to worship Yahweh, the God of Israel. It doesn't say that. It just says, and also much cattle, you know, that's how it ends. And yet their repentance is real and the mercy that God shows them is real. And they somehow have this eschatological place at the end because of their repentance. So repentance is real. You can't say, well, it's fake because you, you're not, you didn't get all, you didn't do all these other things first. Now if someone is not using all the tools, obviously that limits them. You know, it doesn't limit God. It limits us. But there's only one salvation. There's only one salvation, right? There's only one, one becoming like Christ. There's only one Christ. There's not a Christ for non Christians and a Christ for Christians. There's just one Christian, right? So the promises are the same. And those who do the deeds of Abraham are the offspring of Abraham. And if you want to do the deeds of Abraham, the clearest way to do that is to become an orthodox Christian, to live that life faithfully. That is the clearest way. Outside of that, we can't say, oh, well, you can kind of do that and it'll be fine. We can't say that. God did not say, well, you know, there's a lesser version, but we do know that God is going to have mercy on whom he's going to have mercy. And we do know that real repentance is real repentance, even from demon worshiping pagans, which, I mean, that's a pretty extreme example. I think, again, the Assyrians are the worst people on earth. And God would have had, I mean, he's God, he can do whatever he wants. But it would have been very understandable if God had not sent them Jonah. And it simply said, you know what? You guys are the worst. Fire and brimstone for y'."}

No, everyone who believes that anything resembling the Christian God would say, no, there's no one who God can't save. Right. So that means de facto there's no one who can't be saved. Okay, now there's implied here that like, if you say that, well, then that means, I guess you don't have to do anything. Right. The only possibilities are the two extremes. If God can save anyone, right? If there's nothing that can stop him, nothing humans could do to stop him from saving someone, then that means humans don't have to do anything at all. They're completely passive in salvation. That's not a correct corollary. Again, this is the so many people in our society need to take a Logic 101 course. If someone comes to you and says, I'm looking for salvation, I want to know God, or I want to know God better."}

Oh, but what about the thief on the cross, right? Like again, timeout, stop. Okay, look. What? Right, yes. Normally God says that you should go and be baptized.

Number two, I bet we agree that if someone comes to us and says, hey, I want to get saved, we're going to tell them to go to church. If someone says, hey, should I get baptized? We're going to say yes. If someone says, hey, should I be repenting of my sins and change the way I live? We're going to say yes. Regardless of what you think about faith and works and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, you're going to tell them to stop sinning and to repent of the sins they've committed. Okay? We all are.

The rest of the Greeks did not like him so much when he was alive. In fact, Aristotle, who had been his teacher, had to kind of go on the lam from the Athenians because the Athenians were not super happy with him because he conquered everybody else, including the rest of the Greeks. But so Alexander the Great, even though he set himself up as Father Andrew said, is this sort of divine king and divine emperor, was never really an emperor in that he never really got to rule over his conquests. So he, you know, famously conquers the known world, swings over, gets Egypt, then heads straight east, goes all the way into India, gets kind of stalemated eventually in India, and as he's returning back from that, dies in his early 30s."}

Right, right. And so as he's dying, famously, he's asked, these generals are gathered around him and ask who the successor is. Right. Who's going to succeed him? Because potentially that person would then establish a throne and become sort of the ruler of the world. And famously, Alexander responds, Kratotos. Right. Meaning the strongest. Right. And just as that implies the. The Diadochi, his successors, his generals, all proceed to go to war with each other to try to decide who is going to be the strongest and who is going to rule the world. A bunch of them get killed, a bunch of them get routed there. There end up being three main dynasties established one over roughly Greece and Asia Minor. One over Egypt and North Africa, the Ptolemies. And then most important for us in terms of the history of Israel and Judah and Judea, his general Selukos establishes the Seljukin Empire, which is the empire of the east. It's all the eastern holdings. Now over the course of the Seljukid empire, the eastern border is going to continue to move west. Right. So it is going to be sort of perpetually shrinking in terms of how far east it goes because the Indians, the Parthians, eventually resurgent Persians are all going to start pushing back right at that side of, of the empire. And in terms of actually trying to expand, he is the Seleucids are primarily going to try to expand by taking Ptolemy territory. So the eastern border where the Levant meets the Sinai Peninsula, the, the, that southwestern border of the Seljukan emperor empire moves back and forth all the time throughout this period. As the Ptolemies and the cell, you can make war on each other and, and push back and forth. So the, the capital of the Seljukid emperor empire is established, Antioch on the Orontes River. That's Antioch in Syria. That's the Antioch of the Patriarchate of Antioch. That's the Antioch of the New Testament."}

So he goes into Judea and into Jerusalem proper, proper, sacks it, sacks the temple, right? Takes everything valuable, seizes it, goes into the temple, sacrifices pigs on the altar to Zeus, which is referred to in scripture as the abomination that leads to desolation, which is bad. And not only does that, then that kicks off, right? His ruining of the temple, right? Making it unusable until it's cleansed and restored again and rebuilt. His doing that touches off then a persecution throughout the Seljukan empire of Jews. And a lot of that ends up getting centered actually in Antioch, as you might expect, being his imperial capital and having a large Jewish population right there, right at hand. And it's important that this is not an attack on an ethnicity which, as we've said, that concept didn't exist then. This is not a racist thing. This is not. There are no times. And you can see that by the attack, he doesn't just go and start killing them willy nilly. Right? Like kill all of them. Yeah, right. Because he doesn't have those racial, genetic, those kind of archetypes yet, right. It's going to take the modern age and modern pseudoscience to get us to the point where we can have that kind of genocide. He's right. His attack is on Eudayismos. His attack is on their way of life. He wants to break them, of keeping Torah and have them worship the Greek gods like everybody else. That's his goal. Now if he can't get them to do that, he's fine with killing them.

Right now, we don't have any copies that old, but there are places where there may be earlier readings of things or where what's there sheds light on something confusing in the Hebrew. So there's lots of interesting things there. But the problem with assuming too much about that, and this is what makes studying the Samaritan Pentateuch tricky, is that it was also deliberately altered to make the, the Samaritans like the actual. Like they're the real Israel, not these Judahites. Right? And when I say rewritten, I mean, like stuff in Genesis is rewritten. Things are changed, little stories are added and stuff to. For example, a bunch of things happen on Mount Gerizim, which happened to be in Samaritan territory instead of, say, Mount Horeb, stuff in the, in the regular Torah, which they then used to justify having built their own temple on Mount Garrison, which was a temple that was up and functioning at this time. They were doing the cycle of feasts, right? So they're having Passover with lambs and stuff. They're doing these things and claiming to be sort of the real recipients. Of course, the returning Judahite exiles considered themselves the real faithful remnant. Right? And the Samaritans are not only, you know, dubious as to being Israelites, they kind of seem like foreigners, but. But they clearly have a corrupted Torah and they, they clearly are doing things, places where they're not supposed to be doing them. And worst of all, saying that the Judahites are illegitimate, right. Are not the legitimate right followers. So between the two, there is this sort of rivalry, but again, they're both under foreign domination at this point. It's a weird kind of sibling rivalry or weird cousin rivalry going on. It's going to get worse going ahead. That's why we're kind of introducing it now. But from the Greek, the Seljukan perspective, in this persecution, right, the Samaritans are just as bad. They're not worshiping the pagan gods either. And so they also face a wave of persecution from the Greeks. Yeah. So it's, it's, you see, this kind of thing, they really did not understand what was going on with the Jews or the Samaritans or any. They didn't understand any of this. The Greeks didn't. The Romans didn't either. Yeah, My favorite example of that is near the end of the Book of Acts when the, the Roman governor has to, you know, he's sending St. Paul to Rome for his trial and he has to kind of send a document like here's why I'm referring this case to you. Right. Like here's the crime he's accused of or whatever. And the note he sends is."}

They're not descended from Zadok, which when the Temple was restored, that's where the priesthood was supposed to come from in Ezekiel. So they thought both of those were illegitimate. They thought the Temple, therefore was only quasi legitimate. The reason they thought it was quasi legitimate even is that it was built before the Hasmoneans. Right. But the fact that the Hasmoneans now controlled it, were the high priests there, made it very problematic. And so the Pharisees throughout their existence in this period showed a preference for the synagogue system. This is one of the reasons why, when you get to the New Testament, there's a prevalence of synagogues, as Father Andrew pointed out, even in Judea itself. Yeah, right. Where the Temple's there.

Even the Hasmoneans would not ordain women priests. So instead, when Alexander Janaeus dies, her son John Hyrcanus II becomes the high priest. So 76 BC, her son John Hyrcanus II becomes high priest. She becomes queen. So it is separated again, briefly, because she dies in 67. And when she dies in 67, she says, I want my son John here, Kennes II, the high priest, to be the new king and high priest. So in 67, he also becomes king.

He completed the conquest of Gaul, crossed the Rubicon, all that. Poppy's been active in the East. He goes and annexes Judea, just says, hey, guess what, guys? You're part of Rome now. And he does that with a Roman army. So this isn't like, you know, hey, we delivered a letter. Good news, you're annexed to Rome. No, this is. He shows up with troops and famously barges into the temple, barges into the most holy place, and nothing happens to him. Him. He finds nothing there. There's another sign. Nothing happened to him. That something's wrong vis a vis the temple in terms of God's presence there. But also, this is where he sort of starts the Roman fascination with Judaism, because he talks about how the Jews worship their God Solamentis, just with their mind, because there was no idol in the temple. There was just nothing there behind the curtain."}

And Mark Antony's hanging out with Cleopatra, the last of the Ptolemies, in Egypt, and is getting ready to make some moves. And he decides, man, these Hasmodians are more trouble than they're worth. Pompey should have gotten rid of them when he has the chance. And so he has Antigonus edithias executed in 36 BC. This is like five years before the battle of Actium between him and Octavian. And it's not totally clear how he was killed because different sources say different things. And this is mentioned. His execution of Antigonus Matthias is mentioned, for example, in Plutarch's Life of Mark Anthony. So we. We have sources on this.

And we're going to kind of walk through that here now in this third half. But to get to that, we have to start with the contours of what that expectation looked like from the Hebrew Bible. So what are the. The, in many case, from the prophets. Right. We're also going to talk about a couple of psalms. But where is this expectation of the restoration of Israel come. Come from and how is it talked about in terms of that expectation? And then St. Paul is going to come back to that and talk about how Jesus as the Messiah fulfills it. So we have to start with one of the primary ways that the Hebrew scriptures talk about Israel is that Israel is God's portion or his inheritance, depending on how it's translated. And this is. I've got, if you really want it, you know, a list of like 37 different places."}

So this is From Ezekiel, chapter 37, starting with verse 1. The hand of the Lord was upon me, and he brought me out in the spirit of the Lord and set me down in the middle of the valley. It was full of bones. And he led me around among them. And behold, there are very many on the surface of the valley. And behold, they were very dry. And he said to me, son of man, can these bones live? And I answered, O Lord God. You know, then he said to me, prophesy over these bones and say to them, o dry bones, hear the word of the Lord. Thus says the Lord God to these bones. Behold, I will cause breath to enter you, and you shall live. And I will lay sinews upon you and will cause flesh to come upon you and cover you with skin and put breath in you. And you shall live. And you shall know that I am the Lord. So I prophesied as I was commanded. And as I prophesied, there was a sound, Behold, a rattling. And the bones came together, bone to its bone. And I looked, and behold, there were sinews on them. And flesh had come upon them and skin had covered them, but there was no breath in them. Then he said to me, prophesy to the breath, Prophesy, son of man, and say to the breath, thus says the Lord God, Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe on these slain that they may live. So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived and stood on their feet, an exceedingly great army. Then he said to me, son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel. Behold, they say our bones are dried up and our hope is lost. We are indeed cut off. Therefore prophesy and say to them, thus says the Lord God. Behold, I will open your graves and raise you from your graves, O my people, and I will bring you into the land of Israel, and you shall know that I am the Lord, where I open your graves and raise you from your graves, O my people. And I will put my spirit within you, and you shall live. And I will place you in your own land. Then you shall know that I am the Lord. I have spoken, and I will do it, declares the Lord."}

This is not going where you think it's going. Quite the opposite."}

In order to understand what St. Paul is going to do, so St. Paul, a lot of what he's talking about, especially chapters 10 and 11, is he's talking about the Northern Kingdom. And the way he's gotten there is, is in Romans 9 through 11, St. Paul is addressing the fact that, look, even looking around at that time, you're saying Jesus of Nazareth is the Messiah, right? He's the Messiah. He's the King of the Jews, right? And I'm looking around, I've seen a lot of Jews who don't think he's the Messiah, right? Who don't accept that he's the Messiah. So what's up with that, right? If he's the Messiah, why haven't all of the Jewish people recognize him as the Messiah? Why only some of you? And now you got all these people who aren't even Jews saying he's the Messiah, right? What's up with this? St. Paul, this is what he's answering. And so he starts out in Romans 9 talking about Jacob and Esau, Isaac and Ishmael, saying, hey, look, it was never everybody descended from Abraham, right? It was never everybody. It was never about, just like everyone who's literally Abraham's seed, right? There were always some, right? And then some others, right? And he follows that through to talk about faithful remnant, right? There's always a faithful remnant. But man, like, have you read the Hebrew Bible, right? Like the masses, the vast majority of the Israelites were not faithful people. Yeah, we're not giving you the Torah. There's always a faithful remnant who were. But there's this big body, right? So that's sort of St. Paul's first argument is like, if you were familiar with the Jewish scriptures, you know that that isn't a weird situation, right? There would be a lot of Jewish people who would not accept the Messiah when he comes. That's not totally unprecedented. And now he kind of goes into this side question of, well, yeah, but what's going on with that, right? Like, why does God bring these 12 tribes out of Egypt, right? And go through all this and a lot parcels of land to each of these tribes when he knows, right? We talked about last time, what a short period of time it was that they existed as Israel and now they're just gone. Like, what was, what was the point."}

Like, why doesn't God just redeem and bless the faithful remnant? Yeah, right. Like the ones he knows are going to be available. What's going on with this? And so St. Paul is going to appeal to another set of ideas from the Old Testament, but in order to understand what St. Paul is doing, we have to read first this, another passage from Jeremiah, another text for the Hebrew scriptures that St. Paul is referencing. That's in the background of what St. Paul says. Because if, say, you're a Calvinist and you don't read Jeremiah when you're reading this, you'll get confused."}

Okay, so this is From Jeremiah, chapter 18, starting with verse one, the word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord, arise and go down to the potter's house, and there I will let you hear my words. So I went down to the potter's house and there he was working at his wheel. And the vessel he was making of clay was spoiled in the potter's hand. And he reworked it into another vessel as it seemed good to the potter to do. Then the word of the Lord came to me. O house of Israel, can I not do with you as this potter has done? Declares the Lord. Behold, like the clay in the potter's hand, so are you in my hand. O house of Israel. If at any time I declare something concerning a nation or a kingdom that I will pluck up and break down and destroy it. And if that nation concerning which I have spoken turns from its evil, I will relent of the disaster that I intended to do to it. And if at any time I declare concerning a nation or kingdom that I will build and plant it, and if it does evil in my sight, not listening to my voice, then I will relent of the good that I had intended to do it. Now therefore, say to the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, thus says the Lord, behold, I am shaping disaster against you and devising a plan against you. Return everyone from his evil way and amend your ways and your deeds. But they say that is in vain. We will follow our own plans. And will everyone act according to the stubbornness of his evil heart? Yeah, I mean, it's. So from this it's clear that what God is saying to Jeremiah is. And this is where the whole potter image comes from, that as we're about to talk about that, St. Paul uses that if the potter has plans for God, says, basically, if I'm going to punish some nations and they turn from their evil, I won't punish them. And if I'm going to bless a nation and they turn to evil, then I will not bless them."}

Romans 11, starting with verse 17. But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, although a wild olive shoot, were grafted in among the others, and now share in the nourishing root of the olive tree. Do not be arrogant toward the branches. If you are, remember it is not you who support the root, but the root that supports you. Then you will say, branches were broken off so that I might be grafted in. That is true. They were broken off because of their unbelief. But you stand fast through faith, so do not become proud, but fear. For if God did not spare the natural branches, neither will he spare you. Note then the kindness and the severity of God. Severity toward those who have fallen, but God's kindness to you, provided you continue in his kindness, otherwise you too will be cut off. And even they, if they do not continue in their unbelief, will be grafted in. For God has the power to graft them in again. For if you were cut off from what is by nature a wild olive tree and grafted contrary to nature into a cultivated olive tree, how Much more will these, the natural branches be grafted back into their own olive tree. Lest you be wise in your own sight, I do not want you to be unaware of this mystery, brothers. A partial hardening has come upon Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in. And in this way all Israel will be saved. As it is written, the deliverer will come from Zion. He will banish ungodliness from Jacob. And this will be my covenant with them when I take away their sins."}

Israel is blessing his sons on his Deathbed in Genesis 48, before that, Joseph brings his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim, to be blessed. Ephraim is actually the younger son to Jacob to be blessed. And Jacob crosses his hands and uses his right hand to bless Ephraim, even though he's the younger. Because by that point, if you've been reading Genesis at all, you get the point that it's often the younger son who's considered the firstborn, right?

And then centuries later, now, now that Jesus has come as the Messiah, St. Paul is saying, now's the harvest time. If you're paying attention.

And all of the natural born people, right, the Jews, let's just say the Jews have had an opportunity to repent and be grafted back in. If they've been cut off or remain and grow, if they never were cut off, if they've remained faithful, right. And once all of those are grafted in, who are going to be grafted in, then this one whole tree which St. Paul calls in Romans 11:25, all Israel will be saved, then the tree will be complete, then Israel will be restored. And this idea, we've seen this idea in other places like in our series where we've been talking about second Temple Jewish literature, when we talked about the testaments of the twelve Patriarch Archs, we talked about the testament of Ephraim and we talked about the testament of Levi and about how they, they say straight out that through Joseph, right, through Ephraim, the, the, the Mesopotamians, the Babylonians, right.

This isn't just a cope, this isn't just an ad hoc thing he's throwing together to try to explain how Jesus could be the Messiah when he didn't do Messiah things, Right. This is a way in which other people, in the second Temple Jewish period, other Jewish people were interpreting their scriptures to say this makes sense in terms of how God can fulfill, restoring the Northern kingdom. The northern kingdom dying and being scattered as seed, and the fruit of that seed now coming back to God and being grafted in to the faithful remnant that remains. And so at the end of this, right, we have to disambiguate some categories, right? So when the New Testament talks about Israel, that is not synonymous with Judea or the Judeans, it includes Judea and the Judeans, right? But Israel in terms of this tree, right? It goes beyond that. There, there are some other people from the perspective of the New Testament, starting with the Samaritans, who are also, you know, able to, through their faithfulness to the God of Israel, through his Messiah, are going to be able to receive an inheritance with Israel."}

Israel is not synonymous in the New Testament. For the New Testament writers, with those who practice eudaimos, again, they're included, right? Or those who practice Judaism as it's transliterated, right? They're included. They're that root. They're the natural, right? But there are also these who are grafted in, who find an inheritance with Israel. So Israel, from the perspective of St. Paul and New Testament writers, when we talk about all Israel, we're talking about the whole tree, which includes Judah, Judea, the practicers of Judaism, the keepers of the Torah, right? And the fullness of the nations who are grafted in, who restore the Northern kingdom. And so within, right? And this is, you know, cardioclusion. We've been critiquing a lot these episodes, dispensationalism. But we've also critiqued here supersessionism, right? Again, it's not the old tree gets thrown in a fire and God plants a new one, right? Same tree that the Judei. The Jews still have a central role. They're still distinct, just as everyone who's grafted in remains distinct, remains Greek or Russian or Dutch or Polish or whatever, right? They remain distinct, right? But the Jews still have a special central role because salvation is from the Jews. Christ says that, right? Christ himself Jewish. He's the Jewish Messiah, right? This all comes. That's the root, right? That supports the branches. The branches don't support that. But they are not the whole. They're not the whole thing, right? There are these others who are grafted in and included. And that is not. When I say that, I'm not saying that to counter Jewish claims. I'm mostly countering bad Christian claims. Because, for example, when St. Paul asks in Galatians, is God the God of the Jews only and not also the God of the Nations. He's expecting all the Jewish people he's talking to to be like, well, no, of course he's also the God of the nations."}

Right. He doesn't think that. Right. He's expecting them to agree. That's why he's making that argument. Right. And so one of the big problems with this, with the dispensational paradigm, is that it assumes that in the same way that a lot of folks we had a caller about this want to limit salvation to Christians or the possibility of salvation to Christians, we should say, perversely, there's a lot of Christians who want to act like only Jewish people were saved in the Old Testament. Right. Or before. Before Jesus and then sort of now after Jesus. Now people who aren't Jewish could find salvation, like, read the Bible."}

That's what we were talking about in the first episode especially. It was never the case that it was just the Jewish people who were in God's plan. So what St. Paul is saying here is not that wild and out there from the perspective of the Hebrew scriptures, from the perspective of Second Temple Judaism, I don't even think it's that out there from the perspective of Rabbinic Judaism later, depending on where you're at in it. Right. If you could accept that that's what St. Paul's actually saying. I don't think it's that far out. Right. Obviously, a lot of, you know, any Jewish person who doesn't agree that Jesus is the Messiah is going to disagree with St. Paul. But disagreeing and thinking he's wrong is different than saying, this is totally out of line with Jewish thought. Those are two different questions. And so here, to put a pin on it, at the conclusion of our third episode in this history of Israel, I would say, thus, based on what St. Paul has told us, that the rest of the history of Israel is actually kind of church history. And so this isn't a church history podcast. So you should all email Gary Searle Jenkins and ask him to do a series continuing what we've started here, he's."}

How long have we spent talking about this maybe 10 hours or so, in addition to the other things we've said about Israel, you know, for the last almost five years now of this podcast. But I think that for me, the biggest takeaway is, and I've said this before, but I'm going to say it again, I guess, and maybe in a slightly different way this time, that, as you said, Father, the New Covenant is really the renewed covenant. Covenant, you know, it's not a second covenant. It's not a separate thing. It is the same covenant from God from the beginning. It's not Plan B, you know, it's renewed. And in fact, what's shown is how all of these seeds that are planted throughout the Old Testament come to flower in the New Testament. So it's not some. Some radical new thing, you know, that like, for instance, that Ephraim will be the fullness of the nations. Right. I mean, that goes back all the way back to the 12 tribes. Not just the 12 tribes, the 12 men, you know, the 12 patriarchs who headed up those tribes, who are the fathers of those tribes."}

That's even pre Israel at qua Israel. Right. And so one of the problems of, I think one of the great problems of Christians in the modern period, whether Orthodox or Protestants or Catholics or whatever else, is what is the relationship of the Christian to the Old Testament. I think that's one of the great problems of our time. And. And I think that the source of a lot of that, frankly, is stuff that the Reformation got wrong, just got it wrong. And as a result, then there's all these conflicted relationships with the Old Testament. And it plays out in lots of different ways. We've, of course, criticized dispensationalism over and over and over again throughout this series, and of course, Calvinism a number of times as well. But I'll say this, like from within the Orthodox community, we do have a problem. It's not a problem with Orthodox Christianity. It's not a problem with the Orthodox tradition. It's a problem of the faithfulness of Orthodox people, which is that a lot. Maybe I'll even go ahead and say that the average Orthodox Christian is almost completely clueless about the Old Testament. And it's not that he doesn't care about his faith, I'm saying, even like the faithful ones, like the ones who want to be serious and so forth, it's not he doesn't care. It's that he has a wrong relationship with it. He has misunderstood what it has to do with him. As an Orthodox Christian. Right. And so what we've tried to do in this series is to begin to reconnect us by showing how the arc of the whole story is our story. It is our story. These are our fathers and mothers in the faith, whether we have a drop of Semitic blood in us or not. Right. You know, if you're a non Jewish Christian, you're one of those wild olive branches that have been grafted into the natural olive branch to the natural olive tree you're grafted in. You receive life, as St. Paul says, from that root. Right? It's not a separate tree. It's not like, oh, that was the Old Testament. It doesn't matter anymore. We don't believe that anymore. I'm sorry. If you're an Orthodox Christian, you say that stuff, you are acting like some kind of weird Protestant, frankly. Now, I'm not saying all Protestants are that way. Obviously Protestants take the Old Testament seriously. They do, frankly. The average one, at least this is the way it was when I was a kid. I don't know if it's the case anymore, but the average one at least used to read it a lot more than the average Orthodox Christian."}

But because of the distortions of the Reformation, the relationship to that part of the tradition is distorted doctrinally within the Reformation. For Orthodox Christians, if we're looking at it and saying, well, you know, that doesn't really apply to us anymore. Do I really need that? Whatever, whatever, whatever. We are not acting in accordance with the Orthodox tradition. Like, read the writings of the Church fathers, it is very clear that they were super into the Old Testament. They saw it as mattering a great deal, a great deal. That is the language that they speak. But even set them aside, it is the language that the apostles speak. They speak the language of the Old Testament. That is the language that they speak. And you're not going to understand. Just like we showed some bits from St. Paul today, you're not going to understand what the apostles say. If you don't understand what the language is that they're speaking, you're not. So it's really, really critical that we reclaim this within for each of ourselves. As I said, it's not the Orthodox tradition that needs to reclaim it. It's all there. You know, listen to the church services, read the Church fathers, all these things that are the living tradition of the Orthodox Church. It is very, very present. Is very present. But if I am not present to it, then I Have a problem, then I have a problem. And you know, it's one of the great missions of the five year mission of this podcast. Could go longer. Who knows? Five years so far. To say to Orthodox people and anybody else will listen to us, look, look, look at the scriptures, especially the Old Testament. Look at it deeply. You know, it's, it's really, it is an adventure, my friends. It is just the most incredible story. And it's all true. It's all true. So, so don't be crypto Marcionites, you know, Marcion who rejected the Old Testament and thus it distorted the New Testament for him. Don't be that way. You know, dive in. I. It, you know, it's okay if you don't understand it all. Just read it. Just start by reading it and, you know, listen to, like, I love Father Alexis Corey's daily Orthodox Scriptures podcast. Listen to that. You listen to that podcast every day for a year. You'll hear the whole, the whole Bible, right? And, and you keep doing it from year to year to year. You start to really get to know the scriptures little by little. It's so, so worth it. It's so worth it. We're in such a hurry here in 2025. We got so many other things to do. But what is life for? Like, why are we doing all these things to keep ourselves alive? Is it just so we stay alive, just so we stay comfortable? Or is it for something? And what it is that the Scriptures unlock for us, that's. That's what it's for. So that's what I have to say here at the end of this series."}

Lots of examples. Start with controversial ones. Zionism. And by Zionism, that's not code, by the way. I don't mean quote unquote, the Jews. By Zionism, I mean Zionists, the numerical majority of which are evangelical Christians, not Jewish in any sense. So you're dispensationalists or you're Christian nationalists. I warn you once again out there, you Orthodox folks online who think you ought to be Christian nationalists, the Christian nationalists in the United States don't think you're a Christian. The first thing they're going to do is burn your icons because they think they're idols. They're going to destroy our churches. Okay? Christian nationalism, communism, national socialism. Right on and on what all of these ideologies have in common, they all have in common with the Hasmoneans. We're going to get God to intervene. We're going to establish justice. We're going to make everything right. We're going to usher in the kingdom. Right. That's what Reich means, by the way. We're going to do this and we're going to do it ourselves. We do it through our efforts. And our efforts is always code for violence. Our efforts is always code for killing a lot of people and harming a lot of people, victimizing a lot of people. That's what always happens. Be a Pharisee. The Pharisees were the good guys. Doesn't mean they were above critique. Doesn't mean every one of them was a good person. Right? But in the face of all that, in the face of all these plans and projects and agendas and pushes that everyone wants you to get on board with, everybody wants you to participate in all these programs and plans always degenerate into violence. You be the person who stands apart from that, who follows the Scriptures."}

You do that in the midst of all the turmoil doesn't mean you're gonna get a free pass, just like the Pharisees. You're liable to end up one of the victims of one of those programs. But if you do, that's martyrdom. If that happens to you because you're being faithful to God, there's a reward waiting for you. That's the answer. The answer is not to start a counter movement. The answer is not to do violence back, to repay evil with evil, rather than trying to overcome evil with good. I think from tonight in particular, that is the important message, that Spirit of the Hasmoneans is not the Holy Spirit. That's why there was no spirit of prophecy in the land in those days. It's a very different spirit. It's a spirit like all spirits that aren't. The Holy Spirit leads men to destruction, destroying themselves and others. Famous quote. What is good? What does the Lord require of you? To do justly, to love mercy, to walk humbly with your God. So we quoted last time from Deuteronomy, what God has commanded us is not too difficult for us. He's given us what we need to do. It just need to shift our focus to doing that, doing that and waiting for God to act, waiting for him to intervene, knowing that he will and awaiting the glorious appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ. Now you can go home and go to sleep, Father Andrew."}
