And he will be the light of the nations and the hope of those whose hearts are troubled. All who dwell on the earth will fall down and worship him. And they will praise and bless and celebrate with song the lord of spirits. First Enoch, chapter 48, verses 4 through 5. The modern world doesn't acknowledge, but is nevertheless haunted by spirits, angels, demons and saints. In our time, many yearn to break free of the prison of a flat secular materialism, to see and to know reality as it truly is. What is this spiritual reality like? How do we engage with it? Well, how do we permeate everyday life with spiritual presence? Orthodox Christian priests, Father Andrew Stephen Damick and Fr. Stephen DeYoung host this live call in show focused on enchantment in creation. Thank the union of the seen and unseen as made by God and experienced by mankind throughout history. Welcome to the Lord of Spirits."}

Many ways. My question is about. I got two. The more meteor question, if you will, has to do with the covenant that God gave to Phineas. So there's several covenants in the Old Testament. Like God says to Abraham, you're. You're. You will be the father of many nations. Your seed will shine like the stars of heaven, David. And, you know, his seed will have an eternal kingship, king, kingdom from his line, but with, you know, Christ. Christ priesthood is according to the order of Melchizedek. But at least when I'm going Through and reading numbers, it appears that God is making, like, an eternal covenant with Phineas and his descendants. So, like, what happened to that? Like, was it just like, I don't need this anymore? Or, like, man, your descendants, they're kind of lame. Look at the, you know, Hasmonians and all these other people taking this away. Like, what.

That covenant, actually, you know, that starts in. In numbers. There's this weird overlap right now between the Antiochian men Bible study I'm doing and real time of the whole Council of God Bible study where both of them are in numbers. So, like, I've been talking about this passage all the time for the last month or so. So that that covenant with Phinehas, who is Aaron's grandson, right. Is essentially that the high priesthood is going to be reckoned through him henceforward. Right. And eternally. And then that gets further refined around the time of the exile later in the prophetic corpus to being through one of his descendants, Zadok. And that's why the idea that the restored priesthood would be Zadokite is where the Sadducees got their. Their name, the Zedekim, The Zadokites, essentially, even though they were not in any way descended from Zadok, it was pure propaganda to try to legitimize their hold on the high priesthood. But if you're listening, a few episodes ago, when we talked about the Hasmonean period, we talked about that a little bit. But. So all this is going around to the Zadokite high priesthood was not going to serve in a physical rebuilt temple, but they were going to serve in the temple described in Ezekiel. And if we understand, as St. John does in his gospel and makes pretty explicit that the temple in Ezekiel is actually Christ himself, then we ask ourselves, who is the Levite? Who is the descendant of Levi, the descendant of Phinehas, the descendant of Zadok, who serves Christ at the temple. And long story short, as St. Luke sets up in the first chapter of his gospel, it's St. John the Forerunner."}

Of course, Christ being central, but then his mother, Miriam, and St. John, who's set up as this should be the rightful priest. Right. If his father hadn't been exiled and killed. Right. And so that's. St. Luke is making a parallel to Moses, Miriam and Aaron in terms of how he sets up his gospel. So, yeah, so that's a important connection. That's why he emphasizes so much. St. John being from the priestly line."}

No, they're done, but maybe not. Who knows? But so. And that's based on something that's real spiritually in that in Christ we're united to God. Right. But it is through humanity that the rest of creation, animate and inanimate, is brought to God and presented to God. And so domesticated animals are an example of a category in which something in the created order has fallen under the dominion, has been given order by humanity in a sort of transformative way. And so there is a kind of limited partaking of the blessings of God that are proper to humanity that come through Christ, but that sort of bleeds over through humanity, right. To these other elements of creation. And so if someone wanted to. I'm not saying this is true. I'm definitely not saying this is orthodox doctrine, because, like I said, there's no ruling on this everywhere. Anywhere. But you could. You could make a case that it is reasonable that animals that have spent a great deal of time with humans and have therefore been in a certain way humanized. Right. This is true of all domesticated animals, but especially of, like, pets Animals that spend a lot of times with humans start taking on human characteristics that wild animals don't have, even if they're the same species."}

That is too early and kind of, I kind of wanted to know if there's any commentary or what your guys thoughts are on the way. Kind of like the difference between that and the way that the devil reacts to Christ in both in the gospels where he, you know, he, he tries to tempt him. He, you know, everything, you know, he's not, he's not, he's not deathly terrified as far as we know. And also in, I know it's apocryphal, but in the Gospel of Nicodemus, you know, the devil is, you know, kind of, you know, talking the embodiment of Hades and kind of bragging like, hey, we got him. You know, hey, there he is. Look at that guy right there. And then. So my question is kind of like, is there any commentary about kind of like why the devil is so unafraid? Is it just because he's so pride that he's gone into? You know, does he really not know? Or is he just so prideful he's hiding in from himself or has there been any commentary on this or what are your guys's thoughts that I'm interested in? Any of that?"}

Because they're not humans, so they don't experience the world or even themselves the way that we do. I think what they do all have in common is that at least it seems to me in the Gospels, you know, that the demons, including the devil, they know who Jesus is. Like we sometimes get this question, like, why don't they know who he is? I mean, they call him the Son of the Most High, right? So it's pretty clear that they know who he is, but they don't know what his deal is. Like what is it that he's there to accomplish that that seems to be hidden from them. And which is then why you get all of this patristic language about the, the Devil sort of being baited by God, you know, like, like St. John Chrysostom says, you know, hell took a body and met God. Like surprise. You know, there's even language of, of, you know, a divine hook being used in some of the liturgical texts, which all implies this kind of deception against the demonic powers, Right? So to me, the, the reason why some are presented in one way and some in another in the way that, that we read them and the stories that we get about them is to show us different aspects of the demonic world, right. That like for instance, the one of the apostles says that the devil is, you know, he's crafty, right, right. He's going around like a lion trying to devour us, you know, so, so that we should be afraid of him. But on the other hand, you get like that they're kind of pathetic and they run away at the name of Jesus. And you know, and the point there is not, wait, should I be afraid of them or not? The point is I need to remain in faithfulness because my salvation is at stake. But also I should be confident in the power of Christ, you know, not my own power, but in the power of Christ. And so I think one of the big questions always ask for the Scripture is like, what does this mean for my life? Like, how do I repent in response to this? And that would be the reading that I would give based on those distinctions that are being drawn there in the Scriptures. Father, what else might you add or subtract or multiply or divide or square root, as it were?"}

They're demon dead, demonized Nephilim. And so they had been thoroughly demonized, right. So they were lost their humanity. But the point still stands. Whereas the devil is a fundamentally different type of creature, the devil's a seraph, right? So one would expect a kind of different relationship between this high ranking angelic being who has been in rebellion against God since not long after his creation, and you know, the ghosts of dead Nephilim who are sort of on work release. Right. Like that's sort of the paradigm, right, as Jubilees gives it. Like most of their company are confined in the abyss and they're sort of out. And so now they run into Jesus and they're terrified that he's going to send them to the abyss too, you know, and they're like, hey, we thought we still had some time left to get up to our chicanery, right? So, yeah, there's a bunch of things there, but part of it is that the devil is a fundamentally different type of being."}

I'm used to the law being teach, but not the elemental spirit. If I can read the three verse in question here, I mean that the heir, as long as he's a child, is no different than the slave. So he's the owner of everything, but he is under guardians and managers until the date set by his father. In the same way, we also, when we were children, were enslaved to the elementary principles of the world. If I'm understanding correctly, the elementary principles are things like the Titans. So what are those doing in the category of teachers? The best idea I've got is this is a reference to Plato's Shepherd God and the gods of nations from Deuteronomy 32, weak and provisional. In St. Paul, St. Torah is in the same category with them. Am I right or am I way off here?"}

But he's really pulling out these elements of what. What St. Paul says to. To Gentiles is he's accepting that narrative, right? That at the Tower of Babel event, in order that, right, things wouldn't go down as they went down in the flood. God steps back away from humanity, divides the nations, gives them their places to live, as St. Paul refers to, assigns their borders and then assigns the these lesser ranked spiritual beings to sort of shepherd them and intend them. And Plato, as you've heard on the show before, kind of refers to that same kind of idea. So St. Paul describing it that way to Gentiles, even though he's speaking from a Jewish perspective, like, they would resonate with that. They had the idea still way back that something like that happened. And then St. Paul is arguing that through Jesus the Messiah, aside from everything about Jesus as the Jewish Messiah and all of that, that in terms of the Gentiles, through Jesus as the Messiah, he is now calling all. All of the nations of the world back to himself to abandon those things and now come back to him. Right. And so the. In terms of the. The teachers being taught, talked about in a somewhat positive way. This isn't. This is less. There were some good things about Zeus worship. Right. Which St. Paul wouldn't say, because idolatry, of course, is bad. It's closer to, like, St. Justin's Spermaticos logos. Right. The idea that even, for example, that idea that at some point a most high God sort of retreated and we got the Gods we've got now who originally were like, gentle shepherds, like Plato says, and then something changed. Right. The fact that they still had that idea is one of those seeds that St. Paul can now pick up on and say, hey, yes, that God, he's calling you back now in repentance to follow him through, through his Messiah, Jesus."}

That God's will is for this child to live and be healthy. And I know it's God's will, but can we. Can we have the authority to renounce the devil in his actions against different things that he's doing in people's lives and stuff like that? You know, kind of like the. You hear it a lot in the charismatic movement of renouncing the devil and all that kind of stuff."}

I mean, I don't know what your friend's understanding of all that would be. It does sound kind of charismatic. There are certainly some kinds of the Charis, some areas in the charismatic world where the specific words that you speak are considered to be sort of powerful in and of themselves. Like, some will say that words are sort of containers of power and this kind of thing. Particularly you hear that in the word faith, Pentecostal, part of the charismatic world, you know, but certainly we can pray that the devil or other demonic forces would. Would be driven out, that they would. They would fail in what it is that they're attempting to accomplish. But we need to understand that these are not magic spells, right, that are spoken over people, and that, like, make things instantaneously happen. We pray that God would grant our requests. But also demonic power being functional in someone's life, as it is in all of our lives, because we're all sinners, is really a function of how much, in what way, to what degree, etcetera, that person and those around them are cooperating with, with sin, you know. So, like, I know a priest that I know used to have a parish. I think he was in Chicago maybe, and there was a family that kept inviting him, you know, kept asking him to come over to bless their house because there was very apparent demonic activity in the house. And it was, you know, it happened so often that eventually the priest said, look, we need to have a conversation. And. And he, through talking to them, uncovered that there was incest going on in the house. And he said, look, if you don't want the demons to come back like they have been, you gotta stop. You know. So even though this is an orthodox priest and praying traditional orthodox prayers and, you know, throwing holy water everywhere and doing all this exorcistic Stuff the fact that they kept going back to their sin, kept inviting demonic activity back into their lives. And so, yes, we can, you know, like at the beginning of an orthodox baptism, we renounce Satan. Right. You renounce him. But if you, you can go back, you can say, hey, you know, remember me? And. And bring that back. So it's not an automatic. Automatic kind of thing, but yeah, of course. I mean, we should pray for ourselves and for other people that we be protected from demonic attacks. Father, you got anything you want to include?"}

Right. But I firmly believe, as a Christian, that when a child dies, which is one of the most horrible things that can happen. Right. That God has allowed that to happen for a reason and that he can bring good even out of that. Yeah, we. And this is hard. This is a hard thing, right. To. To hear and to say even. Right. Because I mean, we think a child dies and we're thinking, oh, they're never going to get to date and go to prom and get married and have their own kids and. Right. We're thinking about all those things on this earth that they're not going to do, all of those temporal joys and things they're not going to share in. We're not in that moment thinking about all of the potential horrors of this world that they've been spared. But God knows the whole picture. And I also firmly believe as a Christian that those children who die are going to be part of the resurrection, and so I don't fear for their ultimate fate. So, yeah, we just have to be a little careful about how much agency we ascribe to the devil and that we don't sort of limit the power or knowledge or wisdom of God."}

Super paraphrasing here being more of, like, a motive force. Like, of course, they're about action. They're about doing things. The Spirit, the Holy Ghost, fills someone as they're about to do something. In the Old Testament, at least typically when it's like, you know, made explicit. And yet the soul appears to be something more fixed. Like when Christ says, fear him who can destroy both Soul and body in hell. Now, maybe that's just translation thing or not, I'm not entirely sure. But that's not necessarily against what y' all said before either. Y' all had said that the spirit is more of like the life itself. Or maybe that was the soul. Maybe I'm mixing up topics now, but I do know the odds said that the. The consciousness was more located with the spirit. And what confuses me is why would the consciousness and all the memories associated with who you are not be located in the soul? Soul, let's say what I'm understanding is more of a fixed point, kind of like the body, although the body is obviously not fixed either. It's very malleable and moves. Whereas the spirit is kind of what is the motive force to do actions. And it takes on a pattern, like your pattern of action. Do you take on the pattern of demons? Or do you take on the pattern of submitting to the Lord? And that maybe this would be why even if your body and your soul are quote unquote destroyed, not via annihilation. Yeah, annihilation. But like spiritual death in hell, the spirit being a motive force, maintaining that pattern of being that you had maintained in life is what keeps the kind of the death rolling, so to speak. It. For whatever reason, there's still such an issue in my mind with the idea of the soul not being where the consciousness is. And I don't know why that's a problem for me, but I'm hoping y' all can, like, fix that."}

Okay, so the soul is the life of the body. Right. It is related to the body, like the soul is the life of the body. It's not a separate thing from the body. Spirit is a different category that can include the soul. So spirit is an animating force. So your soul can be the animating force of your body. And indeed your body can actually have multiple animating forces acting upon it. So your own soul as the spirit of your body, as the animating force of your body, but also you can be influenced by. By angels, by demons, by the Holy Spirit. Right. And it's not just individual either. It can also be collective. So the Holy Spirit is the animating force of the church, for instance. Right. So I think it's probably be better to think about spirit in terms of function. Right. It's. It's about animating. And. And the soul is much more closely Related to the body in particular. This is why Christ has a human soul, because he has a human body, right? So souls are, you know, are from bodies in bodies. Part. I don't want to say part of. I don't know. But in any event, the soul is the life of the body. So, yeah, it's not that you have a soul and a spirit and so forth. It's that your soul can function as your spirit and usually does when you're still living in this mortal life. You know, it's the thing animating your life. But you can have multiple influences on you. You can have multiple kind of animating factors going on. Consciousness, memory, et cetera, et cetera. So I'm just going to pass the ball over to Father Stephen and see what he says, because I'm kind of interested myself, actually."}

So, yeah, in terms of what Father Andrew was saying about the soul, right. In Hebrew, nephesh, that we translate as soul can also mean a living thing. So, for example, it talks about God creating all of the souls that swim in the water and all the souls that fly in the air. That's about birds and fish, right? It's that, like, disembodied souls. It's not some spherical origin Plato thing, right? It's a living thing, right? Because life of the body, right, it's what makes you alive instead of not alive, right? And so spirit, as we've talked about, is always a collective consciousness. We're not used to thinking about ourselves that way, right? Because we're used to as modern people thinking of ourselves as individuals. But in fact, you as a body that is enlivened by a soul, right, are actually a walking big pile and hodgepodge of smaller organisms. Your heartbeat is actually modulated by your heart itself. It's not even your brain. And we know this because of heart transplants. When you transplant someone's heart into someone else's body, it beats with the rhythm it used to be with in the original body, not the former rhythm of the new recipient. There are all kinds of functions of your body that parts of your brain that are beneath consciousness are taken care of all the time. You don't have to remember to breathe, right? You don't have to consciously do all of these things. You don't consciously digest food. And your entrails are full of bacterial colonies that are not only separate life forms, but are communicating with other people's bacterial colonies chemically. Gross. It's gross. You walk around. I love bringing that up because it so grosses out. Father Andrew. Right. But so over the top of that, you have a point of attention that we call consciousness. Right. And that is forming the collective of all of that. Because you can, for example, choose to hold your breath at least for a while. Right. You can take deep breaths and calm down your heart rate."}

That's sort of over the top. And then we could talk about spirits, other spirits, as being more collective. Right. And that's when we're talking about, like Father Andrew was talking about, motivating people, things. And so consciousness is an intrinsic part. Right. Now the question is. Right. And this is part of why Father Andrew put it that the spirit often includes the soul. That's probably a good way to put it. Right. Because we've talked about before, there are a lot of fathers and even a lot of places in scripture where soul and spirit are not really treated as separate things. So the idea that they are ontologically separate things, we shouldn't start out with that presupposition. Right. They are separable in speech, but there are things that are separable only in speech. So I would say, for example, that it is not possible to have a soul and not have a spirit in the sense that anything that has a soul has some level of consciousness. It may be a very low level if we're talking about plants. Right. But. But anything that has a soul has some level of consciousness. And in fact, I think there are even systems that don't have souls per se, and they are not organically alive that have some very low level of consciousness. So that would mean that something can have a spirit and not necessarily have a. Have a soul, but spirit does bring with it the idea, ideas of volition and communication. Right. Because all of those are factors of. Of consciousness. I don't know if that helps. You're gonna have to call back. I. I mean, this is deep water."}

I say we should stay on, that we should go to the new calendar. It's only for a loop. I'm with the OCA myself, so I'm on the new calendar.

I know, I know. This. This Marcion might be trying to catch us in our words, but I will just be guileless. I mean, the quick answer is you should go with the calendar that your parish is on. That's the one you should go with. But there's a lot about. So people talk about old calendar and new calendar, and even just that kind of. I mean, it's a Normal colloquial way of talking about it. Right. There's nothing wrong with using those terms, but when someone starts to, then it kind of has a moral authority begin to be attached to it. No, you should be on this one. No, you should be on that one. It's actually profoundly ignorant way of phrasing it because historically within the Church, it's not as though there was one calendar and then Suddenly in the 1920s, there was this other calendar that came into being. Historically in the Church, there have been many calendars in use, particularly before the schism after the Council of Chalcedon. And a number of those calendars are still in use by the non Chalcedonians. Still in use, like they were using them before the Council of Chalcedon. So those were Orthodox calendars. So for instance, the Coptic Church, which is not currently in communion with our church. Right. But the Coptic Church has its own set of months with its own set of days that do not line up with the Julian calendar. You know, now you can say this day equals this day on the Julian calendar, but it's not like the numbers are the same, you know, they're not, they're not, you know, and the Armenians have another calendar and the Ethiopians and Eritreans have another calendar. Right. So these were all calendars that have been in use in the Orthodox Church and were not the subject of schisms. Right. They were just the regional calendars used in each of those places with different month names and they didn't align the same as everybody else. And the feast days might be a bit different in some ways. Variety was kind of the norm in the earliest centuries of the Church. And I think that's a really important piece of background information as we think about calendars. And we, and frankly, some people try to sort of sacralize them. You know, they'll say, there's like, I've had people say there's the patristic calendar and then there's the new calendar. I'm like, well, it just so happens that there are Church fathers now who are on the new calendar because there are saints who are on the new calendar, you know, that have existed after that point. So which Church fathers are you talking about and where and when? Exactly. Right. I mean, the reality is like during the Byzantine period, the fact that the Pascalian, you know, the calculation of how you get pascha was no longer lined up with the astronomical facts that it was originally based on, that was known. And there were actually several attempts to try to fix it, but basically practical and Political problems got in the way, and they. And it didn't get fixed. Right. So there were. There were points where people were just saying, oh, this is kind of, you know, this has kind of become a little bit obsolete. We need to fix it. Because the fathers who set this up actually made reference to astronomical facts, you know, But I think the. The overwhelming. The. The overarching question is not which calendar you're on, but that you are on the calendar that your bishop is. Is administering for you. You know, and also should be pointed out, as we have a number of times in this podcast that we don't actually. Even even though someone who's on the old calendar or the new calendar, there are. It's. It's at least two calendars happening at once. There's the one that's based on the day of the year, and then there's the one that's based on when Pasca was right. So it's actually two calendars going on at the same time. And there's variation between, let's say, Greek and Russian and Antiochian and Serbian and Romanian. There's variation between all of these. So there's actually many, many calendars in play right now. So it's really kind of a collection of new calendars and a collection of old calendars. And then, as I said, in the earliest years of the church, there were lots of calendars in play. So I think part of the problem, the biggest element when this becomes an argument between people is this idea that really is kind of unspoken, but it's this idea that. That bishops don't actually have authority to govern their churches, that all they're supposed to do is sort of repeat exactly the thing that came immediately before them, which itself was the product of many centuries of development and changes and decisions and so forth. But apparently bishops can't make decisions anymore, apparently, for. I don't know why, you know, some magical event happened. And now any bishop who makes a decision that's different from something before is simply wrong. It is not a question of heresy. It's just not. Because, as I said, the rule was variety. Early on, the church fathers never, ever said, you know, there is only one calendar that should ever have been used and will ever be used. It is true that you can get various bishops and maybe even saints and synods that at various points have. Have rejected things. Often they're rejecting them because there's a very bad relationship, say, with, you know, the Roman Catholic Church or something like this. But this idea that a particular set of dates laid out in a particular way is kind of utterly sacralized. It's just not. And like you didn't mention this, but this is one of my favorite examples, which I think is really lovely. So in Cephallonia in Greece, very famously, there's a church where on the Feast of the Dormition of the Theotokos, there's a whole bunch of non venomous snakes that all come into the church on the feast day. And they kind of will. They'll come into the church and they'll sort of slither around the ikanastasis and especially around the icon of the Theotokos. And the tradition, the custom is that they're there to celebrate the feast. Right. What's really interesting is that when in Keflania, when they switched from the so called old calendar to the so called new calendar, the snakes switched to. It's very weird, right? Somehow the snakes like knew to show up 13 days earlier, you know, the next year or something like this. And again, that doesn't prove that one count or the other is quote unquote correct. The point is that when the people of God are worshiping God and following the order set by their bishop, then God responds, you know, like the Divine Liturgy happens no matter what time zone you're in, you know, because it's God responding to the prayers of his people. You know, it's not like there's one moment on every single day that you have to do it. Even Pascha itself. Like maybe everybody in one time zone is roughly kind of celebrating Pascha about the same time, but then the next time zone, it's at least an hour different usually. Although the reality is just here in Eastern Pennsylvania, the paschal services start at 10pm or 11pm midnight. Some actually are doing it like 9 in the morning. And we're not all doing it at the same moment. And yet it's Pascha. So, yeah, I mean, I think people need to have a little bit of perspective before we try to be rigorous about these things. So rant over anything you want to add, Father?"}

The Sadducees were compromised because they were using the pagan Roman calendar, and now somehow it's become the holy patristic calendar. But this is a major issue. Right. But the key is. The key is it is a heavy issue, and the heaviness of that falls on the bishops. That's what they're there for.

I have to figure out which calendar is the correct calendar, because if I'm following the wrong one, I might not find salvation. Not true. Not true. You just have to follow the calendar that your local Orthodox church is following.

Just a little clarification on a couple of points. I've made some assumptions based on what I've heard you guys say here and in other places. So if you'll permit me, I'm just going to read this out. In Genesis 4, we see Cain and Abel bring their offerings to God and they both bring food. So that's a sacrifice in the sense of hospitality and sharing a meal. Are we to assume that at some point God instructed them on the proper way to bring an offering? Because this is a structure of worship in heaven. Secondly, seeing how demons have no power of creation, but can abuse and distort what's already been established is the worship we see pagans do in the Old Testament, a distortion of heavenly worship presented to humanity by the demonic powers. And lastly, Father Stephen, do you believe in Joe Hendry?"}

So the first one was, did God instruct Cain and Abel in how to offer sacrifice? Because this is how it goes in heaven. And then also, is pagan worship a kind of distortion of that? I mean, fundamentally, we kind of don't. We don't see God instructing them on how to do this. We just see it happening suddenly. You know, there's. And there's no indication later in the text that God says, hey, that's not what I said to do, or, hey, you got that right. Good job. I mean, the thing about pagan worship and the worship of the people of God is that the fundamental actions. I mean, not everything that goes along with them, obviously, but the fundamental actions are basically the same. It's about offering hospitality and sharing a meal with your God. And whether it's. I don't know. I think that the relationship of that to what we see in the heavenly places, like there's visions of an altar and so forth, you know, it's kind of. I feel like it's reciprocal. Like, you could also ask, well, are we. Is the vision of worship in heaven that we're given, is it given because that's what our experience on earth is, and that's the language of worship that humans know, or is it that that's a prototype and, you know, this is what humans are doing because that's the prototype? I mean, certainly it does function in that way in where God tells Moses, for instance, how to construct the tabernacle, right? He gives them his division and says, now build one of those. But again, that vision is in earthly language, Right. It's stuff that Moses recognized that he could build. I don't know that we need to figure out what comes first. I guess if you have to pick something, you'd say heaven comes first. But again, the question is, why is it being presented that way? You know, like God is. When God is speaking to Moses, he's speaking probably in some version of Hebrew. Is that to say that Hebrew is the language of heaven? I mean, there are. I think. Isn't it true that there are some church fathers that say that. I know that there is that idea that Hebrew is the language of heaven, or definitely the antediluvian language."}

Right. That it was so ubiquitous. There was no one worshiping whatever they were worshiping any other way. Right. And so it's definitionally worship. And so that's just what they do. And in particular, interestingly, Cain and Abel are particularly offering first fruits, which is an additional thing. And the instructions about first fruits doesn't come until much later in the Torah. And part of how that works, there are a bunch of places where in Genesis, most of them are in the patriarchal narratives, but there are some, like Cain and Abel here, where you see people doing things that weren't going to be commanded until hundreds or even thousands of years later in the Torah. And the way that's generally interpreted in Second Temple, Jewish and then Christian sources is that that's because the commandments of the Torah are not arbitrary. They're not understood in a nominalist kind of way where these are just things God decided to say were bad. And they're bad because God says so. Right. Or these things are good because God says so. But that's the only reason, Divine command theory kind of thing. What those examples in Genesis show, according to the common interpretation over the centuries, is that those commandments bring life, and those commandments are true. And those commandments are even described as eternal in many places in the Torah because they're built into the creation itself. So the idea of offering your first fruits and gratitude to God or having the Sabbath day as a day of rest. Right. That's built into how God created the world. And God then reveals that at a certain point to people, makes it explicit in the Torah, which is a great help. Right. But that doesn't mean that that's when Moses on top of Mount Sinai is when God made that ruling and when that became true."}

So, I mean, it's clear that golden is the massive, huge hit. And, you know, EJ's vocal performance in that. Good golly, that woman has talent and skill and training. I mean, hot diggity. But I think the one that. That I think is the best song probably is now here I'm blanking on the name of it, what it sounds like, which is sort of the big, you know, the fight scene at the end. Right, Right after the finale. Yeah, exactly. The finale one where they. Where they kind of realize that repentance and communion and confession is the thing that they really need in their lives. And that's what kind of gives them the ability to heroically defeat the demons with their spiritual weapons. I mean. Right? Isn't that what's going on in that scene?"}

And it's a total earworm. I mean, a lot of the songs in that movie are total earworms, too. And, I mean, one thing I'll Say is, since we're on it, thank goodness, is that, you know, a lot of the people who made that movie are Christians and, and have commented in interviews about putting their, their Christian faith into the, the work that they did in the film. So even though there's like stuff there from kind of Korean pagan shamanistic tradition, it's very mixed together in a fascinating way that ultimately points in a Christian direction because, like, the key thing that happens in the film that is really the turning point of repentance for the main, for the characters is confession. It's, it really is. It's confession, you know, confessing to, to other people, your, your shortcomings, your sins, your darkness, your brokenness, all that kind of stuff. And I mean, honestly, I, I really feel like this film, I mean, this film is crazy popular amongst especially like middle school aged children and certainly a lot of high schoolers and other young people too. But like, what an amazing tool that we have to be able to explain confession and the way that evil takes over. And when you live a certain way, then the demons are whispering in your ear and the things that they say are plausible, right? Like when you hear the actual demons speaking to the characters, what they say is very plausible, you know, and it's when they come back together in communion and to confess to one another their sins and so forth that everything works and they're able to defeat evil and to smash the giant hellmouth at the end. So, yes, yes, what it sounds like is such a great song. So, okay, what else did you want? I know you're being very nice and you're throwing stuff out for me like this, but I know that's not what you actually called about. So what did you call about? Nathan? Not a free person from Kentucky."}

Yes, I remember Father D. Young talked about that. He was saying it feels like people don't believe in either God or life after the resurrection of the dead because we feel like if somebody dies, they have, quote, unquote, gotten away with it and won't be held accountable. But I think actually a lot of people's reaction to that is more of an attitude of Jonah, like, oh, we all know God's a big softy, that he's forgiving and merciful. So I think a lot of people can believe in that, but they believe that God will probably just let it all go. And I think there may be some question out there of, like, how does orthodox see that tension between, you know, mercy and accountability? Like, you know, my father follow Deyoung and he misleads me about which Star Trek captain is best. You know, how would, like, God hold him accountable to that but still show him mercy and forgiveness?"}

So, yeah, I think the, the. There is definitely a certain amount of resentment out there. That's. Which I'm not just trying to sound French because I'm in Southern Louisiana. That's Nietzsche's term for, for basically when you have sort of rage and anger and a desire for justice and no ability to make that happen. So this feeling builds up in you. It's sort of the frustration of your. Your will and your desire. And so. But I think it's less a balance between God's mercy and accountability, right? Because that isn't what happens at the end of Jonah where God explains like, no, here is the mercy, the balance between mercy and accountability. It's Jonah, you need to get your mind right, right. That, you know, you have a bunch of compassion on a vine that sprouted up overnight, but you have no compassion on all of these humans because of the things they've done. Right? So what we're really presented with in Scripture, in the New Testament is all of this is going to get resolved, the accountability is going to happen. Judgment is going to happen. And if we're smart, right, and if we believe that that's true, then that should motivate us to resolve these things now so that they don't have to be resolved at the day of judgment. That's, you know, judge yourself and you will not be judged. Right? So I repent. I judge myself. Right. I confess. I admit to what I've done. I work to try to make it right now. I take accountability now so I won't have to be held accountable later on that day. And so that's for myself. But that then implies in terms of what we want for the other person, we should not be looking at the other person who has wronged us and thinking, oh, you just wait till Judgment Day and then you're going to get yours. Right? We know that that's true, but our hope should be and what we should be seeking to do is out of love for that person and for that person's sake, to try to be reconciled with them, to try to help bring them to repentance before that happens. But that repentance is not them getting off the hook. So this is part of the problem with how we see repentance. Like in contemporary America, we think repentance is, oh, you say you're sorry and then God just lets you off the hook and you don't have to deal with any consequences. That's absolutely not the case. Tell that to David. Yeah, right. David repented is when he is our icon of repentance, according to all the hymns, right? Icon of repentance after what he did with Bathsheba. Psalm 50, right? Made what God holds up before us as an example of how to repent. And yet he had a child die. He had, due to his sexual sin. He had his whole family descend into chaos. He lost his throne for a while, he lost another son, Absalom, on and on and on. There were consequences, all kinds of consequences of his sin. And part of his repentance, part of his accountability was accepting those consequences. When you read through those parts of David's life, every time one of those things happens, right, David mans up and says, this is not, oh, this is what I deserve. God is punishing me like we were talking about earlier, but I did this. I'm responsible for this. He takes accountability and responsibility at each step. This happened because of what I set in motion. This happened because of my failures. And that's why he's the image of repentance, right? Because by the time he ends his life on this earth, when the prophet comes and talks to Jeroboam and mentions David, he says, if you are like David and you keep all my commandments and all of my statutes, then you'll receive these blessings, right? So by the time David, the prophet and king, this is why he's a saint, right? By the time he gets to the Day of Judgment, it's not that he didn't have any sin. He had plenty of sin and garbage in his life, but it was all dealt with. It was all repented of. That's what we should want for ourselves and that's what we should want for other people and not let our resentment become, right? The idea that, oh, you're going to get yours, and like Jonah, oh, I don't want to help you not get your Nietzsche actually holds up as, as a prime example of what ressentiment is. He Holds up a quote from the third part of Thomas Aquinas's Summa Theologica. Now, proviso, Thomas Aquinas was dead. This was done from his notes. So he may not have said this directly himself, we don't know for sure. But the quote is that one of the things that will add to the bliss and the joy of those in heaven will be seeing the sufferings of those in hell."}

Now I understand that does come from the law, and those are the requirements for everybody who lives in Land, not just the Israelites for the, you know, the stranger, the gentile and Israelites land. But I just not quite understand what's so important going on here that makes it so important to be major part of the Council of Jerusalem."}

Leviticus is the holiness code. In Leviticus is how it gets to the Council of Jerusalem. But the not eating blood part goes actually back to Noah, to Genesis 9 after the flood, when God gives humanity as a whole. Right. This is part of why it's to everybody, not just Israel, God gives humanity permission to eat animals after the flood, but not their blood. And this is somewhat fortuitous because I was just teaching about this in the book of Jubilees on Tuesday. So that's fresh. Yeah. And so there's a couple pieces there. This is first is related to the paganism issue. So the before the flood, the world before the flood, the world of the Nephilim. Right. What we've talked before about how. And this is explicit in the Book of Wisdom, it's in a lot of Second Temple Jewish literature, that part of what's going on with the giants before the flood and after, frankly, is human sacrifice and attendant cannibalism. Texts like the Book of Jubilees extend that cannibalism all the way to the animal kingdom, cannibalizing themselves. And so it's really an image of sort of predation. Right. So murder is one thing. Right. But human sacrifice with attendant cannibalism is even past that. Right. Is even more sort of predatory than that killing someone and eating them as opposed to just killing them with some other motive. And so there is this sort of decline, right? In. In paradise, humans are eating fruit from trees, meaning they're not even harming the tree."}

And so after the flood, God gives humans permission to eat animals, but not to eat or drink their Blood as sort of a. A stopgap on humans becoming predatory. And this is also where at this point after the flood, where God says, now there's going to be this alienation between humans and animals, right? You're going to eat them, but that means they're going to not be friendly with you and they're going to try and eat you, right? Like that has a cost already in and of itself that gets further defined. Remember, Genesis is part of the Torah gets further defined in the food laws, right, where you have domesticated animals that you're allowed to eat and you're not allowed to eat non domesticated animals in general, for the most part. And so those domesticated animals are raised in certain ways and treated in certain ways, sacralized in certain ways that allows for them to be eaten. But part of the eating of them is the sacrifice of them. And the way Leviticus say 16 develops out of what's going on in Genesis 9 is the purpose of the blood of the animals that are being sacrificed and eaten. The purpose of that blood is to make atonement. The purpose for which that life is intended is not for human consumption, but to make atonement for the sin in the world, right? Not for. Not for consumption. And so that sort of paints the surrounding picture of why you don't drink blood or eat meat with blood in it, right? And from the perspective of the Council of Jerusalem, all of those issues and all of those points still pertain as they meet, right? There's. There's nothing in that that's been somehow invalidated or changed by the coming of the Messiah other than the one place where we do drink blood, and that's in the Eucharist. Yeah, yeah, yeah, right. And in, in the Eucharist number one, there's no predation because Christ offers himself to us and for us, right? We don't take his life. We're not killing him. He's offering it to us. And his life speaks a better word than that of Abel. And when he offers us his life, when we drink his blood, right? The blood is the life of the thing he is offering us, his life, which is the life of God himself. Does that cover it?"}

How are we to interpret as orthodox Christians, how are we to properly integrate secular authority into our lives, especially when it comes to things like paying taxes? Taxes. Because, of course, in the temple era, Jesus had no problem paying the tax, even though it was a complete roar to the system to enrich certain people. But some of us feel in some countries that not only is it just a get rich quick scheme for some people, but it's actively being used to destroy us in many ways. So, you know, a lot of us might be tradesmen, might be working in cash, and we can set aside a bit more money than we otherwise have so we can pay less tax and have more for the family, et cetera, whatsoever. Classic things. You know all about this, Stephen De Jong. So what are we to interpret within the orthodox tradition, the correct perspective on doing these things? Do we just take it?"}

So, I mean, Christ was asked this question pretty directly, right? Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar? And I agree. I mean, I live in a country where. Where they take my tax money and use it to send weapons to murder my fellow Christians in other parts of the world. So they're doing nothing good with it, right? But neither was Caesar."}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #123 - 2025-08-28 - Pantheon and Pandemonium XVIII Live Q&A August 2025","start":6777.06,"end":6836.22,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"At the time, St. Paul was telling us to pray for the emperor, it was Caligula, and that it was Nero. And what Christ says, and this is often misinterpreted, right? So they could try to catch Christ by saying, you know, is it lawful or no? And they're trying to catch him because if he says yes, then all of the deeply religious people are going to be like, oh, this guy's a Roman collaborator. If he says no, then, you know, oh, we got him. Because the Romans are going to, you know, take care of him for us. Because he's. He's saying not to pay taxes to Caesar. And then what's funny is when he gives his answer, a lot of people interpret it as him just saying yes, right? Even though the text tells us that when he gave his answer, all marveled. Why would they marvel at him just saying yes, right? So what he says is he takes out the coin, right? And he says, who's, you know, whose face is this?"}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #123 - 2025-08-28 - Pantheon and Pandemonium XVIII Live Q&A August 2025","start":6836.22,"end":6836.62,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Right?"}

Whose icon. Whose image is this? Right? And that's a little bit of a play on words because the answer they give him is Caesar, right? But you get the play of what Christ is doing when he then responds to them and he says, okay, give to Caesar what is Caesar's, and give to God what is God's. Because that is Caesar's image is correct at one level. But whose image is Caesar, right? Caesar's a human. He's created in God's image. And so the idea is, hey, this coin, it's got Caesar's face on it. If he wants it back, it's his, right? If he wants it back, give it back to him, right? But then what is God's? Well, everything is God's. I'm God's, the coin is God's, Caesar is God's, right? God possesses everything. And so, yeah, we owe Caesar his money back that he minted if he wants it back, but we owe God, everything, Right? And that's why everyone marvels at that, Right? And it points to the idea that what Christ does with that answer is he relativizes the value of money. He's really saying to the questioner, why do you value this coin so highly? Why is that the highest value to you now, given you could say, well, I'm not. It's not that I'm valuing the money. It's that I'm valuing what I could do with the money higher than what I know the government is going to do with the money. Right? But that's not what Christ. That's not how Christ answers it, and that's not how St. Paul understands it. And so, yes, we should pay our taxes. We should not pay more taxes than we need to. Right? So, meaning we shouldn't cheat, we shouldn't lie, we shouldn't be dishonest about our taxes, but we also shouldn't be dumb and pay more than we need to. Right? Christ says, be wise as serpents. Right. And innocent as doves. And if you're in a democracy, right, and you have some ability within that democracy to whatever limited degree, to change where that money goes or to better things rather than worse things or to lessen that amount of money, then by all means, right? That's. Use that. Use that a power and ability wisely, too. But tldr. Yeah, you got to pay your taxes."}

My family's probably listening from the other room and we definitely want to thank God and thank you both because you guys were totally our on ramp to orthodoxy. And we are thankful to have just celebrated our two year orthodiversary of being brought into the church on the feast of Transfiguration two years ago. So thank you for your part in that and thank God. So I have. I have two questions related to time. I know it's ticking away and I know no one really knows what time it is, but I have two questions. The first question is brought to mind by my son Joshua. And I know in the story of the battle it says that the sun stood still, but having listened to you guys for the last couple of years, I know not to think of the heavenly bodies and bodies the way that I necessarily used to think of that. So I guess my one question is, what is a more full orthodox understanding of, you know, when it says that the sun stood still, what. How many and what are. What are the many ways we can understand that fully? And that's one question. I can give you both or I can stop and let you answer."}

And therefore should I believe in one and be a flat Earther? So, yeah, that's. But that none of that is what's in. In view. So first of all, you have just. At the phenomenological level, right? That's what they experienced. Right. But yes, so this is actually an instance of something that gets talked a lot about a lot in some of the. The latter psalms and in some parts of Isaiah that talk about sometimes in relation to the day of the Lord, the day of Yahweh, like the. The Last Judgment, and sometimes just talking about judgment in general that talk about the actual elements of the physical creation sort of going to war as part of God's army against evildoers, against the wicked. The idea being that again, this idea that there is this created order by sin and wickedness, you set yourself at odds with that order, right? So think about, like Cain can no longer farm. Like, the earth won't yield its crops for him, right? After he. He commits murder. And so there's a sort of enmity there where. And this is depicted in various ways poetically, right? Wild animals attacking people, right? And this kind of thing. And we're used to wild animal attacks, right, As a thing that happens in the world. But the Psalms and Isaiah and these other places and the prophets will talk about like the sun and the moon going after people, the stars going after people. The sun will not strike you by day, nor the moon by night, right? The. The winds, right? A mighty, you know, God will cause a mighty wind that will sweep them away, right? All of these different elements of creations, rivers of water, flooding, right? That sort of. All of these things which serve God. And so that's part of the picture is that it's not Israel making war against these These giant clans, right? These people, it's God making war against them. And Israel is part of God's army, but so is the sun. So is the wind."}

You know, everybody grumbles about daylight savings time and, like, standard time, but the fact is, especially at this latitude, the winter days are shorter and the summer days are longer. You know, we change our clocks back. We get grumpy to adapt to it, you know, whatever. So do we have any understanding about how people, either in the time of Christ's earthly ministry or even earlier than that, you know, back to Moses or earlier, you know, earlier times. Do we know how the, you know, ancient people dealt with what, you know, daylight savings time, with the days being shorter sometimes and the days being longer sometimes, you know, did the. Are there more night watches? Do the night watches last longer? Do they make other adjustments? Like, do we have any idea about how anybody back in those times would have adapted to that?"}

Yeah. It's interesting, actually, if you ever get a copy of it depends on which edition, I guess, but there's a great big book called the Horologian, which is one of the liturgical books of the Orthodox Church. And part of it has at least a lot of versions of it will have a list of the snick saria for each day of the year. And then when you get to a new month, and you can see this, sometimes the manaen, too, when you get to a new month, it'll say something like, the day hath so many hours and the night hath so many. Now, obviously, that's based on a certain latitude, whoever wrote that, Right. Because it varies depending on how far north or south you are. But nonetheless, there was this idea of, okay, this month has this many hours, and then this month has this many hours, you know, of daylight or night, night time. And the references in the Bible to, like, the first hour, the third hour, the sixth hour, the ninth hour. Those don't line up to like the times that we have where it's like 8 o' clock in the morning or 9 o' clock in the morning or whatever. It really is based on the sun, you know. So, for instance, Vespers traditionally happens at sunset, which means that it's not the same time of year all year round. And there are. I don't know if this happens everywhere there, but definitely in. In places on Mount Athos they are still following this. Right. But they all have clocks too. So what happens is they'll say, well, in this month, Mattins is at 2am, but at this month it's at 4am, that kind of thing. Right. So they're still doing it, but then they're kind of laying and overlaying on top of our standard kind of clock times. Right. So they've adapted and they're sort of doing both. But, yeah, I mean, a lot more of it was just simply relative to where the sun was, which, I mean, in many ways strikes me as a much more kind of natural way to live, because with the advent of, like, electric lighting and this sort of stuff, that really changed the world and it made it so that the clock way of living that we have now became possible, you know, where you just turn the lights on and then you turn them off whenever you want to go to bed. So that's my knowledge of a lot of that. Of course. I mean, different regions have different traditions about how to mark time. The fact that we have 24 hours in a day, doesn't that come from the Sumerian's father."}

So you count 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1st, 2, 3, 1, two, that's 12. And so you do that five times, that's base 60. But, you know, with two hands, you've got 24 of those segments."}

So keeping that in mind, here's my question. Okay. When the Roman Empire was Baptized. One of the things that they did that you've talked about before is they went to all these pagan holy sites and buried saints there to, you know, make sure that, you know, the demons were kicked out. Right. And maybe I'm misunderstanding how that works. Exactly. Feel free to correct me. Right. In light of that, how much of, like, our problems with Americanism or however one wishes to frame that is sort of because, like, we just don't have enough saints buried here yet. And, like, that's what we need to work on. And like, you know, and like, how does that inform, like, you know, how much of a waste of time, like, you know, culture warrior type stuff and whatever, on the Internet, you know, whatever. Right. Is when the ultimate goal on changing this country that, you know, a lot of people listening to this show live in for the better is ultimately, you know, hey, we, we need to bury saints here. Does that make sense or am I misunderstanding?"}

Yeah. I mean, I. What I would say is I, I agree with you that, that we need more sanctified ground, but I would also say that one doesn't sanctify the ground only by having the shrines of saints. Although I'm. I mean, I'm a big one for going on pilgrimage to the shrines of saints. And I should mention that there are seven canonized Orthodox saints whose main relics are here in America, you know, meaning like their whole bodies or the vast majority of their bodies. And actually, I've done research recently that I discovered that there are 20, I should say seven canonized orthodox saints who lived in America whose shrines are here in America. But there are actually 20 other orthodox saints that have major shrines here in America. Either the whole. They're almost complete relics, or maybe a major body part like a skull or a hand or a foot or something like this that are in Catholic churches. Interestingly enough, I published an article about this on the Orthodox history website. I think I call it something like the other American Orthodox saints because a lot of Orthodox are not aware of them. Right. But in addition to that, it's like, how do you change your country? You change it by making it holy. I think it's St. John Chrysostom who says at one point he's talking about the city of Constantinople, and he said that if just 10 of us, if just 10 of us lived the Christian life for real in this city, we would light the place on fire. And so, I mean, that's how you. That's how it's really done. The problem with culture Warring is it's about trying to force other people to live according to the commandments of Christ. Hopefully that's what we're trying to. Hopefully that's what the. The goal is anyway. And not just my commandments, without them actually being on board with the gospel. One of the things that. Father Stephen, you've said this a bunch of times, I know, on your whole Council of God podcast and maybe a couple times on this show, too. I don't remember that God never commands Israel to go and force the nations to live according to the Torah, but rather that Israel is supposed to be a light to the nations and that the commands to the church as the renewed Israel is. Is the same. That we're to be a light to the nations, that we're to preach the gospel to the nations. And then once someone has accepted the gospel and begun their process of repentance, then they're taught the commandments of Christ and how to repent. So the problem with culture warring is that you're asking people to live like Christians when they're not Christians. Or especially. Or we could even make it more specific, live like Orthodox Christians when they're not Orthodox Christians. Why would you live as an Orthodox Christian if you're not an Orthodox Christian? You know, what's your reason for that? But it's much more effective to live a saintly life. That doesn't mean that we shouldn't participate in public life, right? That we shouldn't participate in the civic community. But trying to use force to make other people live like Orthodox Christians, I mean, it's just not even going to work. So I don't get why we do it. It's like, just not successful. You know, hearts have to be changed ultimately. But yeah, I mean, I'm a big fan of saints, shrines, and making pilgrimages to relics. I now keep a list of all the ones I've been to. And I've been to five of our. The American Orthodox saints who lived here. I've been to five of those shrines. I have just two left to go. One is in California, St. Sebastian Dabovich. And then the other is the newly canonized St. Olga in Alaska. She's pretty hard to get to, but I intend to go there at some point. But, yeah, I mean, live as a saint. Sanctify the place you're in, make it holy. You don't have to wait until you're dead or a holy person around you is dead, you know, but certainly the body of a saint in your place is a powerful thing, for sure. Yeah. What would you have to add to that, Father Stephen?"}

That's not genus Homo. Okay, so that's something that's not. Again, from a secular scientific perspective, that's not human. That's a different species. So, yeah, our ancestors in Dargerland were, were humans. And meaning they're made in the image of God. They had human souls and lived lives not that much different than Homo sapiens were living at the same time. The, the differences that cause us to distinguish them are primarily their height, some of their bone structure issues with their shoulders. They had a slightly different shaped skull. And one of the things that did was it gave them very high pitched voices. But Neanderthals buried their dead. They produced art. They made tools and weapons. Yeah, we have a cave that's covered with multicolored handprints made with different colored dyes from Neanderthals."}

But on the other hand, some of the fruits that it gets used in certain Hindu ceremonies is definitely offered to Celtics. So on this spectrum, what's actually offered?"}

Oh, I love the fact that you asked about halal. So, I mean, a lot of people have no idea what really is going on there. It is primarily a butchering method. And the only part of it that even seems slightly ritualistic is that when the throat of the animal is cut, the person doing it says bisma, which means in the name of God. That is all that it means, really. So you know, it's. It's probably a Muslim person doing it, and they say, in the name of God, which. That does not constitute offering a sacrifice to an idol. You know, that involves, you know, offering sacrifices to idols, involves setting up an image and, you know, dedicating that image."}

Which if there's anything that Muslims are super duper against, it's idolatry. Like, that's just kind of part of their core identity. That's why they're traditionally very, you know, iconoclastic, at least of Sunni, particularly. Yeah, it's not. I mean, that doesn't mean. I agree with Islam. Islam has a lot of problems. But. But that's not idolatry. Halal meat is not idolatry. It's not. Yeah. Putting, like, fruit in front of a statue of Ganesh, along with prayers and, you know, incense and whatever. Yes, that is a practice of idolatry. You know, the idea is you're sharing a ritual meal with your God and you just think. I mean, just think about that in terms of sharing a meal with another person. What do you do? You put food in front of them and then you share it with them. Right, That's. And. And, you know, with idolatry, you're doing that with an image that has been specially dedicated for this purpose. Right. And has a whole ritual matrix surrounding it. Not just the dedication, but then the ongoing worship of it. And, you know, there's the care and feeding of an idol, all that kind of stuff. So. So, yeah, I mean, halal meat. People get really excited about this, but it's just not. It's just not. Again, this is not a validation of Islam. But. But someone cutting the throat of a lamb and saying bismillah does not constitute sacrificing to an idol. It just doesn't. So, yeah. I don't know. Is there anything else to add to that? Seems."}

I found myself exposed to evil in various forms. That has been more disturbing than usual. Let's say the death of a young person and pretty awful circumstances and the terrible cancer and parents praying for a miracle and prolonging his treatments and suffering for a long time. A friend that I had kind of distanced myself from is found to have murdered her husband in a pretty horrific and sensational tragedy that happened this summer. Anyway, incidents like that. My background is Armenian. A more ancient part of Armenia has been now ethnically cleansed and its churches are being defaced. Things like that, that strike me as very evil. My question is about how God uses evil events even to, for God's purposes in our world. And sort of a two parter, like how do we, how are we to meet those events?"}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #123 - 2025-08-28 - Pantheon and Pandemonium XVIII Live Q&A August 2025","start":9795.87,"end":9796.83,"speaker":"Audience Member","text":"That's my question."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #123 - 2025-08-28 - Pantheon and Pandemonium XVIII Live Q&A August 2025","start":9797.79,"end":10135.97,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Yeah, well, really the two questions are, are kind of one. So if we look for instance at great evil that happens in the Old Testament to the people of God, say, you know, the Assyrians coming and massacring huge numbers of the 10 tribes and carrying off a lot of the rest of them into exile forever, or even the Babylonians carrying off Judah into exile, you know, for a while, most of them still again, forever, or, you know, getting conquered by various peoples or disease or snakebite or. I mean, the list goes on and on of all kinds of terrible things that happened to the Israelites. Slavery for 400 years in Egypt. You know, what God always calls the people to do in response to these things is repent. And it's not that God is saying you were bad and so I'm beating you up because you have to suffer, right? Rather, the point is, is that Israel in many cases is off the mark, has, has lost its way. And so God permits, or even the language is used sometimes of God sending, you know, these various nations to come conquer Israel and this kind of thing so that Israel would turn back to God and would renew their faithfulness to the covenant with God. Right? But also at the same time we see holy people suffering, right? So it's not just in response to some great sin that suffering happens. We see holy people suffering, we see prophets suffering, we see the apostles suffering. Like the apostle Paul very famously said that there was a messenger from Satan or an angel from Satan that was attacking him. And he asked God three times, take it away. And God said, no, my grace is sufficient for you. What's the point of that? It's not that Paul was bad and God was beating him up. It was that this very holy man, like the prophets, like any of the righteous people who suffer in the scriptures, that they're being actually given an opportunity for greater repentance, an opportunity to become even holier, right? And so the, the response to suffering, whether it's I'm in sin and then suffering comes, or you know, by God's grace, I'm living a righteous life and suffering comes. It's it's either way, the response is repentance. And repentance is not just to say I'm sorry or to feel guilty. Repentance is to increase faithfulness to God. Sometimes that means going from, you know, rebellion to faithfulness, but sometimes it can mean going from faithfulness to even more faithfulness. Right? But either way, that's the purpose and that's the purpose for demonic presence in the world. That's the purpose for so called natural disasters, all of this kind of stuff. The presence of evil in the world. God permits in the world as an opportunity for us to repent. And it says in Scripture that he chastens those whom he loves, whom he loves. Right? And so whether we use the language of God sending it or use the language of God permitting it, it's all within God's economy, that is to say, his plan for the salvation of as many people as possible because he's not willing that anyone should perish. So, you know, when suffering comes, we have an opportunity to use it for our repentance. A lot of times we squander it by complaining, right? By shaking our fist at God, by whatever it might be, you know, or even by choosing to fall into despair to turn away from hope in God, which is what, like the word despair literally means to, you know, unhope. So, yeah, I mean, it's, it's, it's not fun, it's not great. It doesn't feel great to see. Like some of the stuff you described is horrifying. It's just absolutely terrible. But, you know, for, for someone who sees it and experiences it, the response is to increase their faithfulness or if, if they're living in any kind of rebellion to turn away from that to faithfulness. Right. It's like I said, it's not, it's not always a, it's not a punishment in the sense of God is going to smite you because you were bad. It's a call to repentance. And repentance is something that we do even if we're living in faithfulness. But if there is any unfaithfulness, then that definitely needs to be taken care of. So that's, that's what I would say to that. I mean, it's, it's hard, but we can see very clearly in Scripture all the kinds of things you describe plentifully, and we can see what God says the people are supposed to do in response to that, both collectively and individually.

Any, any time in living memory. And, and these things are lived realities for huge swaths of the world today and all of the accompanying horrors and violence and everything that happens there. Not only have we not directly experienced it, but we, we have a great capacity to shut it out. I mean, if you don't want to know what's happening, the horrors, the absolute nightmarish horrors that are being inflicted on children in Gaza right now, if you don't want to know about it, you could not know about it. You just pretend it's not happening, not look at anything. And that insulation is a horrible spiritual detriment to us. It's sort of like what God says to Israel when they're coming into the land of Canaan. And he says, you know, you're gonna, you're gonna get in there, you're gonna forget God, you're gonna forget about me, you're gonna plant your vineyards and get, get about your day to day life and you're gonna forget all this. And that's the incredible spiritual danger that we face that leads us away from repentance. It leads us away from the idea that God put us here to do some things, not like Virtue Signal on social media, like actually do things to actually help people, to try to change things, to try to do good in the world. And so I think when the reality of the sin and depravity of wickedness in the world inevitably intrudes, as it's intruded on you in a very powerful way recently, all sort of at once. It's a call not just to repentance in the broader sense, but also to sort of realigning our view of the world and of our life in it and its purpose and of instead of forgetting, remembering, remembering God, remembering what reality is and remembering what it is that we're here to do and be about, which isn't just having a nice lifestyle and enjoying. And enjoying it as much as possible."}

So my question, earlier this year, you did cover Leviticus 12 in. In 1 respect, this is the. The purification after childbirth. And I appreciate the helpful distinction between a ritual uncleanness, impurity, and sin. But one of the things that still I have a question about and someone near and dear to me in my life still has a question about, is the difference, the distinction that's made between male and female children and the length of. Of uncleanness and the length of time for purification. It's like twice as long after girls are born as after boys. And sitting here in 21st century America, something feels a little unfair or off or unbalanced about that distinction that's made there. And whereas I can in some of the other places in the law, like compensation for female and male servants when they're injured. And I can kind of attribute that to, well, economic value and kind of a simplistic explanation there. But this one about purification after childbirth, I'm really struggling to explain why boys only require half the purification that girls do or the mothers after the birth of boys and the birth of girls. So wondering if you can enlighten me on that."}

As some kind of something wrong. Right. And let me suggest that that is not the best way to understand this in that there is an expectation that there are things that the person is supposed to be doing."}

So another example of this is, you know, at various points in Numbers and Deuteronomy and Joshua, where the military age men of Israel have to go and do certain business that involves killing other human beings. They have this period of purification where they have to stay outside the camp. That's not punitive. Right. That's God's way of helping them work through what we would now today call ptsd, where there's a whole process where after a certain number of days they wash all of their weapons and their armor and their clothing, and after another period of days, they wash themselves. Right. That it's. There's sort of this process. So what we have to understand in terms of male and female children is that in the ancient world, there was very much a world of men and a world of women. And the world of women was in and around the house, and the world of men was outside the house. Now, often that wasn't very far outside the house that was working the Fields, Right. Because this is primarily an agrarian kind of thing. So if you lived outside of cities, as most people did, right. The woman was in charge of the household and the man was out working the fields and in charge of whatever laborers were out there and whoever else and the sons were out there assisting. Now, obviously, the child is not at the end of this period of purification, ready to go start working the farm. But the idea is that the male children were sort of separated earlier from their mothers. There is within the story of Jacob and Esau, right. This is one of those subtle things, but the story of Jacob and Esau in Genesis, it is somewhat problematic, the fact that Jacob as a son is spending all this time with his mom around the camp and not out with the other men. And part of the way that ends up playing out in the story is that he. He becomes. He becomes sort of advanced in the ways of women, meaning women did not have power in that society. And so when you are the party that is out of power, when your husband has all the actual power, well, how do you exercise power and influence? Talking, gossiping, scheming. Right. And that's how that plays out. Right. Rebecca sort of initiates Jacob into all of that. Right. And that's sort of how Jacob becomes this trickster character who he starts out as, and then he has this growth arc. Right. But from the perspective of the text in that culture, part of where this went wrong is that man. Why is he hanging out with all the women folk all the time? Why isn't he out there with the. With the men? So the. The idea here is that we want to. Male children need to not become overly attached to their mothers in that way, whereas we want a greater attachment between a daughter and a mother because the mother is going to be raising the daughter to be a woman in that culture and society. And that daughter, when she's old enough, is going to be helping around with the business of the household while her brother is out there with their father and other brothers and hired hands and everything and everything working the farm. So we tend to read that, and we read it as if it's this putative thing like, oh, you messed up. You had a girl. Because we think that the period of purification is in some way or other retributive. But actually, if anything, it's actually penalizing the male children. The male children get separated from their mothers earth earlier than the. Than the female children."}

I have things to say about this. But I'll say this briefly before you go, Father Stephen. I think it's, number one, it's really important that we figure out a way to heal that break in communion. Number one, because I think all Christians should be in communion with each other. But it has to be on the basis of a common, of the common Orthodox faith. Like, we can't compromise on that. So if it can be determined, you know, that we do truly believe, teach, practice the same Orthodox faith, then, you know, then communion should be. But if we're not there yet, then we have to hold off on that. So one of the things that it's my understanding, and this is by much smarter people than I am, much better informed people than I am, have told me, is that there is variation within the Oriental Orthodox communion about expressions of Christology. And that is one of the things that it's my understanding remains an issue that even within, like I've been told, again, this is what I've been told, like, within the Coptic communion itself, there are debates about significant theological issues that are a pretty big deal, that the way that Christology is defined is not exactly the same between the Armenians and the Copts. And The Malankara Church and the Ethiopians and Eritreans and the Jacobites, the Syriac Church. And obviously that's not a communion dividing thing between those churches. And yet from the point of view of the Chalcedonian Orthodox, it can be difficult to work through that because, like, well, what are we saying we're trying to agree with here, you know, so all of that is, all of those are complicating factors. And also a big, a big, big issue is the fact that on both sides of the question, there are anathemas leveled against people that the folks on the other side regard as a canonized saint. So that's not something that can just be sort of brushed away either. Right. So all these are kind of complicating factors. But I mean, I would say that, you know, I've had a lot of personal experience with people from the Oriental churches and it's always been great. I've loved it. I have some good friends, you know, people I went to seminary with actually in the Melancoa Church, and I've, I've spoken at some of their events. I've been invited to do that and I've always loved doing that. I have a great sense of warmth and love for my friends in those groups. So that's what I would have to say about that. So dive in, Father Stephen."}

I mean, honestly, historically, the real reason for the split is Roman soldiers killing a lot of non chalcedonians in the 6th century. And what I mean by that is when people have died over something and the memory of them dying over it is still alive, it makes it almost impossible to resolve by just talking. Right. That's just a reality across the board. Not just in terms of this issue, not even just in terms of religion, but politics, all kinds. You know, it's hard to just say, okay, water under the bridge, let's make a fresh start, you know. But yeah, as Father Andrew said."}

I mean, really, most of the churches in the Oriental Orthodox union function kind of independently, but they're in communion with each other. So let's say, you know, the Patriarch of Constantinople sits down with the Catholicos of Armenia and they hammer something out, right? And say, no, we really agree on these things. We really agree on these things. We accept each other's traditions. If they restore communion with Armenia. And Armenia is in communion with, say, the Copts. And there's some significant portion of the bishops among the cops who don't agree with the bishops of Armenia and the bishops of. Of the Synod of Constantinople on major issues of theology. That creates a huge problem."}

From the Orthodox side, we have to kind of talk to each group individually, but it's really hard for us to act on anything until we've hammered out the same kind of agreement with every single group. Right. In order to actually make anything happen in terms of restoring communion. And that, I think, is what creates the huge current impasse. And I, too, had fellow seminary students who are Malankara. I've never gone and participated in events because I'm not an ecumenist like Father Andrew."}

And they're people who I love, you know, And I think it would be a beautiful thing if we could all come together around shared faith and then based on that, share the Eucharist. I think that would be wonderful. But I think it's very difficult right now. And I think step one is actually going to be. I mean, I don't want people. We may have Coptic listeners. I don't want you to think we're picking on you, but right now there are some major theological divisions, as Father Andrews said in the Coptic Church."}

That's where I know about it, too. And I think. So the first step I think is going to be those have to be resolved and hopefully those will be resolved in a positive way that will bring us closer together rather than being resolved the other way. But I think that's going to be step one toward making progress in that direction. And that's something that the Coptic Church needs to do themselves. I can't come in from outside. Nobody can come in from outside and try and force that. Yeah, that's what got us into this mess."}
