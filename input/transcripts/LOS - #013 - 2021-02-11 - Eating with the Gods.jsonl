And he will be the light of the nations and the hope of those whose hearts are troubled. All who dwell on the earth will fall down and worship him. And they will praise and bless and celebrate with song the Lord of spirits the modern world doesn't acknowledge, but is nevertheless haunted by spirits, angels, demons and saints. In our time, many yearn to break free of the prison of a flat secular materialism, to see and to know reality as it truly is. What is this spiritual reality like? How do we engage with it? Well, how do we permeate everyday life with spiritual presence? Orthodox Christian priests, Father Andrew Stephen Damick and Fr. Stephen DeYoung host this live call in show focused on enchantment in creation, the union of the seen and unseen as made by God and experienced by mankind throughout history. Welcome to the Lord of Spirits."}

I am Father Andrew Stephen Damick in the borough of Emmaus in the beautiful snow blanketed Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. And with me is my co host, Father Stephen DeYoung in Lafayette, Louisiana, where it never really gets truly cold. And if you're listening to us live, you can call in at 855-AF-RADIO. That's 855-237-2346 and we will get to your calls in the second part of today's show. So have you ever noticed that worship is never defined in the Bible? There's no place in which it says, and this is what worship is. Now we do get very detailed instructions for worship, especially in the book of Leviticus. And then there are bits and pieces in the New Testament, but worship happens long before any of those texts are written. In fact, we see it happening in Genesis chapter four with the sons of Adam and Eve. Cain and Abel offer sacrifice to God. It's not explained, not defined, not placed within any existing religious ritual context. Cain and Abel make sacrifices to God. If we're going to understand the sacrifices of Cain and Abel as well as worship in the ancient world in general, and indeed Christian worship up until our own time, we need to understand the ritual context of the ancient world. What did the earliest worship look like? Was there a lot of variation? Did different cultures come up with very different ways of worshiping their gods? So let's think back now as best as we're able to, thousands of years ago to the earliest known human settlements and they happen to be found in what is now modern day Turkey and the Holy Land. So Father Stephen, take us back."}

So the cold is just a different standard down here. And also, before we get started tonight, we should probably let people know that, like Gall, our discussion of sacrifice has been divided in three parts."}

This is the first of three episodes about sacrifice. So we can hear there's a whole bunch of cheering happening all over the. All over the world right now, I'm sure, in response to that. So. Yes. So this is part one where we're going to be talking about sacrifice in the ancient world."}

And as is our want, we're going to go back and start at the very beginning, as you mentioned, which is in the Neolithic period, the Stone Age and Stone Age religion. So I'll do our date disclaimer."}

This isn't based on carbon dating or paleontology. This is. We're talking about human settlements. So this is standard layer archaeology. Some listeners may have a commitment to. To the idea that the earth is not as old as some of these settlements are purported to be."}

Adjust them accordingly. But however you. However long or short you feel the timeline is, these are the earliest human settlements either way. Right?"}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":345.66,"end":362.71,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Which is in the Holy Land. The Jericho that's in the Bible. But although it's where exactly the settlement is, has shifted around a little bit in the area. Right. There's been human settlement there dated by archaeologists back to circa 10,000 BC."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":363.35,"end":363.75,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Right."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":365.75,"end":381.43,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"So that's. That's how far back we're Going. So we're going back at least some millennia before the civilizations of Babylon, before even Sumerian civilization."}

We have sort of the remains of people living and doing things. And these aren't really cities. That's why we're saying settlements."}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":406.47,"end":413.28,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"So these are just places where previously nomadic people put down roots. And we'll be talking about that more in a minute."}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":415.44,"end":427.12,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"So then the two that we're going to discuss in more detail, the first is Gobekli Tepe, which is one of the sites in what's now Turkey."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":428.08,"end":431.76,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Southeast. Yeah, southeastern Turkey, right near the Syrian border."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":433.04,"end":459.84,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"And. And that site, again, is dated by archaeologists the beginning of the settlement to somewhere around 9,130 BC flourishing around 9,000 BC and then the second one is Catalhoyuk, which dates from a little later, from around 7100 BC as it's just."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":459.84,"end":461.08,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"A couple thousand years later."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":461.48,"end":462.92,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Right, so. So."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":463.16,"end":463.64,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Wow."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":464.28,"end":482.17,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Yeah. So one, Gobekli Tepe represents one of the first permanent human settlements. And then Catalhoyuk represents a sort of later, a little bit later phase of the development of human settlements and villages."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":482.81,"end":485.73,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Yeah. Based on what we actually find there in the dirt."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":485.73,"end":486.73,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Right, right."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":487.05,"end":487.53,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Yeah."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":488.65,"end":501.62,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"So Gobekli Tepe, in some sense, I'm about to try and do TV on the radio, because I'm about to talk about monoliths, which, of course, I can't show you pictures of."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":501.94,"end":522.42,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Yeah. But. But if you. If you happen to go on to our. Our faith, our Lord of Spirits podcast, Facebook page, we actually did post some pictures from these sites. So you can see some of this if you go to Facebook and. And look at this. There are a few things there. So. But yes, right now we're going to play Imagine, if you will."}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":524.88,"end":525.52,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Exactly."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":527.12,"end":552.03,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"So there are very early monoliths, monolithic structures, stone, standing stone structures at Gobekli Tepe. They're arranged. It will be reminiscent to some people, probably, when you look at pictures of Stonehenge is probably the. The closest thing."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":552.51,"end":552.99,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Yeah."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":553.71,"end":557.55,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"And I have wistful feelings about Stonehenge."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":557.87,"end":560.11,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Oh, is this where we get where you finally tell the story?"}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":560.35,"end":568.59,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"I'm not gonna tell the story, but I have been banned for life from Stonehenge. The exact circumstances will remain a mystery for now."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":571.23,"end":576.95,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"But you know, that's gonna be a Lord of Spirits T shirt at some point. Banned for life from Stonehenge."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":576.95,"end":578.5,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Yeah, banned from Stonehenge."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":580.97,"end":581.21,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"So."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":581.69,"end":587.77,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"But what's really striking about these particular monolithic Gobekli Tepe is the carvings, I think."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":587.77,"end":588.13,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Yeah."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":588.13,"end":589.45,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"For anybody seeing them."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":589.77,"end":590.09,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Right."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":590.09,"end":590.45,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"If you."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":590.45,"end":601.77,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"If you look at our Facebook page and see these pictures, and also there's a Wikipedia page which is, you know, has lots and lots of pictures, and there's. There's animal carvings on these things, on these standing stones."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":602.81,"end":631.17,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Yeah. And it is unclear to archaeologists and anthropologists exactly how to interpret the animal carvings or even if they should be interpreted. Right. Because interpreted implies that it's some kind of pictographic language, and it may not have been that. It may have just been representations of animals, but they're arranged in a way that suggests that they were used for some kind of astrological observation."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":631.94,"end":633.34,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Yeah. Much like Stonehenge."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":633.34,"end":657.7,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Much like. Much like Stonehenge was in. In the ancient world. But all of this point, what all this points to is that the remains there are not the remains of sort of a village that was constructed to do commerce. Right, right. Or that was pulled together because someone set himself up as a chieftain or a king."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":658.42,"end":665.14,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Yeah. It's not set near some natural resource. Right, right. Yeah."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":665.54,"end":668.9,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Right. And so what it is, it's the remains of a ritual site."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":669.94,"end":670.34,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Right."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":670.74,"end":696.41,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"And so there had been in the past, sort of a consensus among scholars that the first human settlements developed for sort of practical, material reasons. Right. And that then once that happened, they started developing religious beliefs and other elements of culture."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":696.81,"end":707.05,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Yeah. Just like, you know, it happened in the early American West. They built a town, and then, oh, I guess we should probably build a church or something. Right."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":707.61,"end":746.73,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"And what they're finding with Gobekli Tepe and a few other Chalcolithic sites is that the exact opposite is true, that these. These first sites were actually ritual sites and began as places of pilgrimage. So nomadic peoples and people, groups, tribes, clans, would make some sort of periodic pilgrimage to these sites. And. And so the need to service those pilgrims and the ritual needs of the site actually then gave birth to the settlement."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":747.45,"end":747.85,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Right."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":748.49,"end":781.94,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"So what we're talking about here is it's not really a single event, but a development in history that's referred to as the Neolithic Revolution. And that's the move from humans being nomadic and hunting food and gathering food. And if you're going to hunt and gather food, you sort of have to be nomadic because you have to move with the seasons in terms of being able to gather food, and you have to move with the migration of animals if you're going to hunt food."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":782.18,"end":842.39,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Yeah, Right. Which. Which, you know, if you think about the ancient world, being nomadic is the smartest way to be. Right. Because if you stay in one place, then, you know, you could get attacked easily by your rivals. You know, staying in one place also means you're subject to all the seasons of that place. Right. You know, as I think you just said to migratory animals, you know, it doesn't make sense not to move around. So we think that the way human beings live now is normally. I mean, obviously, most human beings in this world right now are settled. You know, they live in places and they don't move around. So it seems obvious that that's the norm, but it was really not the norm early on. Really, really not the norm and not really a very good idea. So it would have to be a really important reason for you to actually build something somewhere and then sort of stick with it. Yeah."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":842.71,"end":865.91,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Right. And so it happens sort of in the. The reverse of what was previously assumed, that this ritual site has a need for people to dwell there permanently, and it has a need for. For food."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":868.63,"end":870.31,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"So you got to supply it developed."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":870.31,"end":893.11,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"For the pilgrims and for sacrificial rituals, as we're going to be talking about for most of tonight, those things have to be. Have to be provided. And so that causes the shift then to agriculture and to the domestication of animals because we have to be able to produce food at the site."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":893.71,"end":893.91,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Yeah."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":893.91,"end":900.27,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Regardless of the season, regardless of the. We have to be able to. And then after producing food, we have to be able to store it."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":900.99,"end":905.47,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Right. There's gonna be guests all the time, so you got to keep the place stocked."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":905.79,"end":916.35,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Right. And so these material changes to life are the product of the religious significance of the site."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":917.39,"end":917.79,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Right."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":918.11,"end":919.95,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Which suggests something further."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":920.52,"end":920.76,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Right."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":920.76,"end":966.59,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"And. And this, this shift that I'm talking about to seeing the. The religious and ritual significance of the place first and then the settlement is a shift that's being made by scholars who are atheists. Right. This isn't. This isn't a religiously motivated thing. This is where the evidence points. But as religious people. Right, right. We. We could assess something further, that for this site to become a pilgrimage site, for it to become a religious site to which people would travel from different clans and different groups that are otherwise nomadic, there had to be some kind of actual spiritual or religious experience there."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":966.67,"end":969.39,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Yeah. There's a significance to that spot."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":970.27,"end":991.32,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Yeah. That. That, that was experienced by people, and it can't just be like one person. Right, right. So I mean, if one person comes out of the woods and says, hey, I met the great God, you know, Pazuzu, out in the. Out in the woods, right. That's not going to cause even the members of his own group to all go out in the woods and try and find it."}

It has to be a repeated thing, you know, like, like, you know, when people discovered. On a much lesser sense, when people discover the Grand Canyon, hey, come take a look at this. And people have the same experience every time they go. But in this case, it's an experience where people are saying that they encountered a being, a spiritual being."}

So, I mean, there are parallels to that, for instance, in Orthodox Christian experience where, like, for example, Trinity Saint Sergius Monastery in Russia. Right. This is. This was founded by St. Sergius of Radonesh, who basically went out of the woods to pray by himself. But now if you go there, it is not only a massive monastic complex, but it's a city. Like it is literally a city. And the reason why the monastery was formed was because of St. Sergius being there, who, you know, because he's a saint, he becomes a vessel of grace. Right. And so people go there to experience that as well, and then the city grows up around it. So it's. I mean, it's exactly the same pattern. It's exactly the same pattern and it makes a lot of sense. I mean, and once again, this kind of just shows that modern people tend to think, even if they are religious, they tend to think of religion as a kind of add on, even of maybe the most important add on in their life, but a kind of add on. Whereas what makes you. In the ancient world where everybody is mobile, wants to actually build something and start to raise crops and that kind of thing, it must be something super important, you know, and all signs point to that super important thing being spiritual experience."}

And I think there's also a problem for modern people trying to apprehend this, because especially those who live in, say, the United States, because our population tends to be so mobile and so uncommitted to the places that they're from. You know, people tend to move for whatever reason, usually a job or whatever, and the idea that you would. That place actually is an important thing is just not. It's just not a thing. I mean. I mean, just for instance, right now, you know, you're in Louisiana, I'm in Pennsylvania, headquarters is in Indiana, and people are listening to us all over the world. And I mean, this is a good thing, but it is a fundamentally displaced thing. You know, It's. It's. And. And so I think that's another problem with. With, you know, like, the modern skeptical mind. If you say, well, this is the place where Jesus was born and so there's a church here, the modern skeptical mind would say, is that really where he was born? Because we tend to think that place is actually not that important. Right. Whereas in the ancient world, it was super important. This thing happened here, and it keeps happening here.

The most ancient version of that word refers to a place, but then eventually the word came to refer to a spirit that kind of inhabited the place. And sometimes, you know, most of the time people would avoid them and sometimes they would go there specifically to kind of encounter them, and you get the same thing. And again, in Norse mythology, where, like, there's a particular. I think in northern England somewhere, there's actually a particular bog or something like this where there's indications. It's either in northern England or maybe in Scandinavia, there's indications that people are being sacrificed to Thor. And. But, but the place was named as a place sacred to Thor because that's where you would go to encounter him. It was a specific sacred place, you know. Yeah.

So if you think about, if you're a nomadic tribe or clan or family group or however you want to construct it, part of this, this group, this social unit that's nomadic, and you encounter other humans. Right. Another group of humans, you have various options, right? The two most obvious would be if you think your group is bigger and stronger, you could try to subdue them, conquer them, kill them, take their stuff. Right. But now if you encounter, you know, Leviathan, the queen of the Stone Age, proverbially. Right. Like, you can't kill her and take her stuff. Right, Right. So that options right out. So the option that remains to you is the option that would remain to you if you met a bigger group of people or just another group of people who you didn't want to attack.

This is the second part of our show and it's where we begin to take your calls. So we just talked for a little bit about why anyone would want to have a relationship with a demonic chaos monster or giant bull. Or giant bull Right, right. Kind of depends. Are you inland or are you near the ocean? You know, and we, we ended up by saying that it's because you don't want to be destroyed by them. And so then the proper response to that is hospitality, to offer hospitality. And so that's what we're going to be talking about now in this second part of our show. So please do call in again. It's 855-AF-Radio-855-237-2346, and we would love to talk to you. So. All right. So, Father, I mean, in these ancient, ancient super ancient sites that we've just been talking about, there's no writing. We just have kind of material stuff to kind of go by. But it gives a pretty clear picture that there is dedication to these, these beings and so forth. But we don't know what exactly that looks like. What are the actual actions? I mean, archeology doesn't, can't show you what people do. When's the earliest that we actually begin to know, have some clue about what this hospitality that was being offered actually looked like?"}

Because, because the, the spoken parts are traditionally, you know, if, for. Especially for those of you who are not clergy and have never looked at liturgical books that clergy use, the parts that you're supposed to say are written typically in black ink, and the parts you're supposed to do are written in red ink, at least in a better, better service book.

And so it'll say, you know, say this prayer and then, you know, swing the sensor in this direction three times and then that direction three times and then. Right, yeah, exactly. Over here. Right. And so ancient Near Eastern ritual texts sometimes are written as stories. So rather than, for example, being written as instructions, it will tell the story of some event in the life of the gods and, or the people performing the ritual in ancient days that the ritual is based on reenacting and participating in, but it's just telling the story."}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":2522.43,"end":2581.56,"speaker":"Samuel","text":"Yes, well, it's tangentially related to the topic, I suppose, but it's more related to something that Father Stevens Talked about in the 5ish fall of angels and on his own podcast as well, something that's puzzled me. And he's talked about the angels that were assigned to the nations and how there was this, I guess you could call it an angelic apostasy. They began accepting worship and interacting with humans in not so kosher ways. I guess my question there is, was this fall of these angels, was it universal? Did they all experience this fall? And. And if so, what made it so universal? And then just to follow up, what would it have looked like had that fall not occurred? If they had done their task rightly, rather than accepting worship and encouraging this idolatry, what would that have looked like?"}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":2582.6,"end":2607.74,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Okay, well, Father Stephen, I'm definitely going to let you address the first part because you were called out specifically, but since there is someone who listens to this show, is convinced that this show and the Aman Sul podcast are truly the same, I'm going to throw him a bone and say that what would it have looked like if they hadn't fallen? I think that it would look like the way that the Valar function in the Silmarillion. Now, Ryan, I don't know if you're a Tolkien fan, but if you are."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":2607.74,"end":2620.26,"speaker":"Samuel","text":"I'm a huge Tolkien fan. I came to. Basically came to orthodoxy through Aman Sul. I'm not. I'm not orthodox. I'm not even a catechumen. But I'm prayerfully considering it now, so. Yes, that's right, Father."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":2620.26,"end":2703.04,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Yeah, so there we are. No, I mean, I'm serious. Like, obviously there's a lot of non Tolkien readers out there who are like, what is he talking about? The Valar, or whatever. But it' it's an image of angelic beings. So J.R.R. tolkien, the author, he writes this. This is in the Silmarillion. So this is not his most well known work. It's. It's second tier in terms of being well known. But in that work, these angelic beings that are created by the one God, they help to take care of the earth and also human beings and, and elves, of course, as well, who are sort of kind of two different versions of one species, so to speak. And they help to beautify the earth and to form it and to teach things to mankind. And it's a good relationship. I mean, it has its problems, but they don't fundamentally go off the deep end. I mean, one of them does. So I think that that's a good image of what it would have looked like. Right. And maybe we can understand Tolkien's version of this as what it might have looked like before, you know, after the Tower of Babel, but before this fall that was being discussed. So that's my idea for the second part. So, Father Stephen, why don't you address the first?"}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":2703.6,"end":2935.41,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Yeah, well, it seems to have been near universal. Saint Dionysus the Areopagite and others. You see this in, in Eusebius's. Eusebius of Caesarea's explanation of the Gospel. Also, for example, the exception is St. Michael, who was the prince of Israel, as Daniel says, right. Daniel talks. He talks about the prince of Persia, Gabriel talks about the prince of Persia, he talks about the prince of Greece and that he says, michael, your prince. Right. So the angel assigned to Israel, St. Michael the Archangel, is sort of the one exception to that. And so I think, you know, building off of what Father Andrew said, I think the best image we can get biblically in terms of what that would look like is Israel. That doesn't mean that, for example, the people didn't fall into egregious sin. Obviously they did, right? In terms of their, their behavior and faithfulness, there was not a lot of difference between most of Israel and the neighboring nations, even though there was supposed to be. But there was always a sort of a different relationship between God and Israel. And I think the Intercessions of St. Michael and of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and others were part of that difference in terms of the long suffering that God showed. Not to say that they influenced God, right, But that God chose to work through their prayers and intercessions to extend his mercy to Israel in a way that now God also showed, according to St. Paul in Romans, he showed a certain amount of mercy to the nations in overlooking their sins for a period of time, right until the Gospel came, not immediately punishing them for the wickedness and sin that abounded among the nations. And that's sort of St. Paul's theme when he speaks to Gentiles in Acts 17. You know, in the past, God has overlooked all of this, but now the gospel is coming to you. Now you're accountable right now. You need to hear the call. And I think what's in the background, what we've been talking about already tonight, is the material side of that, right? So when we talk about, well, these, these angelic spirits started to appear to and interact with and encounter the peoples of the world and started to influence them, and then we talk about how they started to give them these cultural innovations and these kind of things, right? What we've been talking about anthropologically in the first part of the program is the material side of that, where we see human beings encountering some kind of spiritual reality at these places, and then that being the engine that leads to agriculture. The first city, right. Kane builds the first city. Right. The first kind of permanent settlements, the first domestication of animals. All these sort of innovations that start metalworking, starts in the Chalcolithic period that we're talking about, just like the genealogy of Cain says. So this is really the flip side of that, right? We were talking about the spiritual reality of that in the 5ish falls, and now we're sort of talking about the historical human side of that."}

Yeah, you said you thought that your question was tangential, but actually it fed directly, directly into what we're talking about because, you know, this does connect back to that earlier stuff. And like Father Stephen said, now we're looking at what is the human sort of interaction response to, to, you know, when fallen angels do their thing. So thank you very much, Ryan. Thanks for listening."}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":2980.27,"end":2996.35,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"And so we don't start getting sort of a more full orbed picture until we get to Greco Roman sacrifices, where we could piece together from a number of sources and descriptions, sort of the details of how some of these things played out, right?"}

It has generally some recognizable parts, pretty universal. How does it actually work? So the first part is a procession. People walking in a line, People processing. Yeah, right.

And so of course, the most, the most common form that hospitality takes is the sharing of a meal. Exactly right. And we've, we've become a little disconnected from this. In modern American culture a lot of times now, families don't even eat meals together, let alone, you know, gather with other families or other people to have communal meals."}

And, and the significance of that."}

And so the way that a, that hospitality is going to be offered to a God and some kind of fellowship and communion with that spirit is going to take place is going to be in the form of sharing a meal with it, primarily amongst other forms of hospitality, but primary a meal. And so that's what Sacrifice is."}

And so in these processions that the practical side of the procession is you have these elements that are going to be sacrificed. That's not necessarily. We tend to think of animals primarily and in some more horrible cases humans, but we tend to think of animals as the primary thing. But there are also plenty of sacrifices. In fact, most sacrifices did not involve killing animals. The majority of sacrifices were of, for example, wheat cakes or rice cakes if you're in Asia, depending on where you are. Grain. Right. Cakes made with grain. It would also then include food animals. These were domesticated food animals, not like wild animals. You wouldn't capture a wild animal to sacrifice."}

Sacrifices are always food. It's not, you know, I think, you know, you made this point, but I just want to underline this, that a lot of people have this sense that ancient sacrifice was always about killing an animal, putting it on an altar, whatever, but it wasn't even always an animal, but it was always food. You know, you don't sacrifice a chair. You know, you sacrifice something that can be eaten because it's a communal meal. That's, that's exactly what's, what's going on here."}

I'd love to say, well, just tune in next time because that's what we Talking about, among other things. But. But I mean, just to just, you know, we don't want to leave you with nothing. I'll just say this. So all of the stuff that we're talking about with regards to paganism now, which is kind of what this particular episode is about, it, it becomes fulfilled completely in the Christian context where not only are we having, you know, sacrificing to our God, sharing a meal with our God, but that he himself is the one who is sacrificed and shared. Right. So how does that change? There's a hundred things we could say about this, but it's that the life that we receive, for instance, this is the first thing that occurs to me to say the life that we receive from this is eternal life. It's not temporary. Right. And it is, and it is deifying. It changes us. So it not only puts us in communion with him, as all sacrifices always did to whatever God, but makes, you know, and not only makes us like him, as all sacrifices do to whatever God. We're kind of getting ahead of ourselves here a little bit, but that's okay. But grants eternal life and elevates us to become, as we've said before, the sons of God. So that's the response I would give initially to that. Father Stephen, is there anything you want to add or correct or whatever?"}

And then Christ's sacrifice that we're going to be talking about more two episodes from now, in our third episode, is sort of the fulfillment of that and the ultimate inversion of. Of what pagan sacrifice is. And one of the key elements is, is exactly what you're hitting on, that rather than it being a spirit taking something from humans or seeking to be appeased by humans, God meets us in sacrifice with self offering."}

Now, obviously, the animal is not saying that, but it's, it's, it's ritually sort of tokenized by a tuft of their hair being cut out. And then that hair that was cut off is then placed in the incense. So it's, it's that the animal is offering himself now by this little gift of. This offering of hair that has been cut off and is being burned up with, with the incense. We're going to talk about incense more later. But, but yeah, I thought that was a really interesting thing. And like, animals are not tortured in the process. It's, it's, it's really a peaceful sort of slaughtering, frankly, you know, and, and that the, the killing itself is not really part of the ritual. It's just a necessary element if it is going to be an animal sacrificed. It's a necessary element in order for the sacrifice to be possible. Right."}

You know, if you're offering hospitality to your God, you're going to offer it an animal that's freaked out and sort of tastes the worst, you know, so you wouldn't, you wouldn't want to do that again. Not a farmer, not a shepherd. So I don't know if we've got any cattle ranchers out there. You'd be like, oh, no, no, no. That's completely an urban legend. Father rancher. I don't know.

But far more commonly and especially in Greco Roman practice, at the various shrines, in addition to the shrine to the God or spirit or muse or whoever. Right. The Caesar, whoever, there would also be a grave of a hero. And hero was kind of a technical term in Greek. Right. It's not just we say, someone is my hero, but heroes were the founders of cities, people like Perseus, Theseus, who did these great deeds in the past. But no matter how great the deeds were that you did, when you died, you still went to Hades and became a shade.

And so to do this, he goes to one of the many places where there's a Gateway to the, to Hades, to the underworld. See our future episode on Sacred Geography. But he goes to one of these places and sacrifices some black goats and pours their blood out into a pool. And the blood sort of attracts the shades up out of the gateway to come and drink the blood in the Odyssey. And that ultimately lures out Achilles so that Odysseus can communicate with him. So that is in story form, what's going on in the sacrificial ritual with the grave of the hero and the, and the blood."}

I know how you do that. But like, what about burning a cake or something like that, you know? And, and, and then that's when the point. When you said that's what the oil is for. Yeah.

Yeah, because I don't really. I don't really know the answer to this one. So, Father Stephen, why don't you take a crack at it?"}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":4595.46,"end":4681.87,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Right. Well, yeah. So as we talked about a little bit last time, what is it like to be a bat? Right. Angels don't experience sort of space the way we do. Right. So it's, it's not like they're either here or in heaven. Right. Or. Right. So you Know, Christ says about guardian angels, about the guardian angels of little children, that their angels are always before his, His Father in heaven. But that doesn't mean they're like, not with the children. That's just saying that. That they have this prominent place in the divine council, meaning God is very attentive to what's going on with these children. He's protective of them is what that's indicating. So we don't necessarily have an angel who's like only our guardian angel and has never been the guardian angel of any human before or of any human in the future. And that's okay. Just like we have a patron saint who's the patron saint of a bunch of other people and has been the patron saint of a bunch of other people. And so I think the last piece of that, that I didn't answer yet is that, yes, we will be able to get to know them in the world to come."}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":4686.11,"end":4729.62,"speaker":"Unregistered: Christiana","text":"That's so. That's. That's inspiring. That's so exciting. Yeah. Okay, so second question. Does our guardian angel carry our soul to heaven after we die? I saw this on an. On. On a page that sold icons. And in the description, it was a. It was a. I was looking for some pro life sort of icons, and there was one where it's a guardian angel and a baby, you know, one that, you know, the one that had died in the womb. And, and in the description, it said that guardian. Just carry your. Your soul to heaven after you die. And I'm like, wait a second. I've never heard that before. I gotta ask this."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":4730.34,"end":4765.54,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Yeah. So I mean, it's certainly the case that we see in saints lives that angels come to take the souls of the righteous to paradise. I mean, that's. Now whether. I don't know whether you could say, oh, oh, here's the guardian angel. And then six other friends he's brought with him. You know, they're not usually named in the saint slides I've. I've read. But the idea that angels do accompany the soul to paradise is pretty well established, I would say. I don't know. Is there something specific about the guardian angel, Father Stephen? Right."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":4765.54,"end":4779.46,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Well, that's. Yeah. I mean, we, as Orthodox Christians, we believe that a person's soul takes a journey after they die, usually corresponding to 40 days. But that. Yeah, our guardian angel accompanies us on that journey."}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":4810.63,"end":4820.87,"speaker":"Unregistered: Christiana","text":"Yeah. When do we get our guardian angels? Do we get them when we're born, when we're baptized, or when we're Chrismated? If that's different from when we're baptized?"}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":4823.67,"end":4881.53,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Well, definitely at baptism. Right. Because in the baptismal service, it's specifically prayed for as part of that, especially the part actually right before the baptism itself, you know, the exorcisms and so forth at the beginning. What else, though? I mean. I mean, there certainly are cases where angels are. I mean, I think part of the problem, right, is that God assigns angels to take care of us, to guide us, to pray for us, to defend us, all these kinds of things. And we have this concept of a guardian angel. But I wouldn't necessarily say it's like, okay, this one has this hat on, right? So certainly angels are involved in people's lives at every point, but there is definitely this kind of connection that happens with baptism. I don't know. I don't know if I'm making any sense here. Father Stephen, please help me out."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":4883.3,"end":4885.54,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"This is kind of a. Porque no los tres?"}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":4891.14,"end":4959.24,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Because again, we. I keep coming back to what it's like to be a bat. We experience time as humans, right? As this. This succession of moments. Right? And we could try to literalize that when we're talking about God, right? So we say, well, okay, this is. This is the point where I really came to understand the Gospel of Christ. If I died five minutes before that, what would have happened? Right. See, we can think that way, right? But we're kind of assuming that, like, God and the angels are on this parallel track with us. It's experiencing time the way we do. Right. Or like God didn't know or whatever. So there are events in our lives that we experience in our lives at a particular period of time. Right. At a particular point in time, but their reality isn't limited to that point in time. So something changes for me at that moment. Something doesn't change for God."}

So for me, at My baptism or charismation. Right. There's a guardian angel who I enter into this relationship with, but that doesn't mean that the angel was sort of sitting around waiting to be assigned up until that point. Right. Like, in a waiting room, like, outside, you know, when I was being born, you know, pacing with my dad. Right. Or that. That God was, you know, getting ready and thinking about which one he would write. Like, that's silly for me. Yeah, that's the point. But the reality of it extends not just forward from there, but also back."}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":5023.13,"end":5042.41,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Like, we have. We have a guardian angel. Yeah, we have. We have a guardian angel, but we also can have a patron saint. Our family can have a patron saint. Our church can have a patron saint. If you go to my church, that's Archangel Gabriel. Right.

{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":5109.43,"end":5128.54,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Because what follows that burning at the altar is the feast where everyone's going to eat. And this isn't just a question of eating the things that were actually sacrificed. Right. Like the other pieces of the animal right there."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":5129.1,"end":5133.5,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Yeah. There's side dishes. Right. At these feasts."}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":5149.09,"end":5170.85,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"And so those are the other things that were eaten along with the sacrificial feast. And so, for example, the temple of Demeter in Corinth had huge dining Halls, banquet halls. And that wasn't to rent out for, like, wedding receptions. That was part of the sacrificial worship. Was everybody going and eating."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":5171.33,"end":5185.64,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Yeah. And the important. At least one of the important things to get from the fact of side dishes is to emphasize that this really was a meal, you know, it was really a meal that was shared together."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":5186.84,"end":5235.64,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Right. And this created the kinonia in Greek, the fellowship, the communion. It formed the community, and that included the God or gods or spirits, and the humans bound them together. And we'll probably talk about this more in a further episode, but this is in the background of what St. Paul is talking about in Corinthians to the Christians at Corinth, about not eating at an idol's temple, not eating food offers idol, and also about becoming a communicant, having communion with demons by participating in these meals. Right."}

It's not just about don't eat the bad food. There's a ritual event that's occurring, and it is a religious. It is quite literally a religious experience. Yeah. Yeah. And usually, if I recall correctly, especially once you get to the Greco Roman period, the next thing that typically happens is a lot of immorality along with it as well."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":5266.26,"end":5273.18,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Well, right. Because. Yeah. It's not just a feast like, hey, let's sit down and have a potluck. It's a party."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":5274.06,"end":5276.1,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Yeah. In the worst possible way."}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":5280.36,"end":5299.84,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Yeah. And all of this especially, like, the detail of it, kind of just underlines what priests were in the ancient world. Right. Like nowadays we tend to think of priests largely as pastors, which is why there was this wonderful rumor that went around as soon, as long as I was no longer a pastor, that I was no longer a priest anymore. Not true."}

But that priests in the ancient world were largely not pastors. They weren't doing pastoral counseling. They weren't, you know, all that kind of stuff. They weren't administrators. They were kind of ritual technicians. They were specialists in exactly how you do all this stuff. Precisely. Exactly how you do it in the way that the God expected and. Right. Because, like, there was the idea that you could do this wrong. And also there is often divination that went along with it. Right. Like, you know, parts of the animals being cut open and. And reading what's in the entrails and using that to predict the future and that kind of thing. And that's what priests did. That's what their job was, was all of that. And. And I think, you know, and then one of the things that's underlined by that is you can get it wrong. Like, the God might decide he wasn't into the sacrifice. He might reject your invitation to dinner or having tasted of it, you know, say, no, you did this wrong. Right."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":5379.49,"end":5381.81,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Right. We've all been to a dinner party that went bad."}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":5385.65,"end":5400.81,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Where things went. Went sideways. And that could happen with the gods too. Right. Someone could say the wrong thing, do the wrong thing, offer the wrong type of food, make some kind of faux pas."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":5401.45,"end":5401.81,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Right."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":5401.81,"end":5452.93,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"In terms of the. The manners required at such a function. And so, yeah, part. A big part of the reading of entrails that a priest called a Haruspex would do. And we've got. One of the things we find a lot are these hardened fired clay, like, models, like, scale models of, like, livers and kidneys from animals with writing, like cuneiform writing on them, indicating what to look for in the different parts. Part of it was that was his job, was to read whether they were doing it right or not and whether the offering was being accepted or not, because they believed there would be signs. Probably one of the most dramatic of these is once before the Roman armies went into a really disastrous battle, the priest who was doing the butchering at the pro thesis discovered that the animal they just killed had no heart."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":5453.57,"end":5455.97,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Oh, it's a bad sign."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":5456.05,"end":5462.45,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Yeah, that was literally a really bad sign. And lo and behold, they lost. Right."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":5462.77,"end":5463.17,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"So."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":5464.21,"end":5467.41,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"So they were looking for those kind of things."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":5470.24,"end":5528.51,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"I was gonna say this makes me think of, like, when you go to the doctor, right. And, like, now I'm gonna have to make Haruspex jokes the next time I go to the doctor and they're looking at a. An X ray or something like that, I'm like, so, you know, what do you read there, Doctor? You know, as he quietly chuckles to himself yeah, yeah. All right, all right. So, okay, well, where we've. We've taken up most of our time, but there's something that kind of goes along with all of this. Right? And that's. And that's a question that probably a lot of people would have like, okay, well, okay. The offering of food, whether it's meat or, you know, cakes or wine or oil, puts you in communion with the God. That's an offering. It's a. It's a. It's a shared meal. It's a communal experience, you know, so. But what about all these incense that comes along with it? What's the deal there? Is that a sacrifice too?"}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":5529.15,"end":5545.15,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Right, right. And we've already mentioned in the procession and some of the details there that incense was being used there and incense is offered. That's the language we use. Incense was offered on altars. There were altars of incense."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":5546.21,"end":5546.45,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Right."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":5547.09,"end":5589.66,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"In all cultures. Right. But also, as we'll talk about more next time, in the tabernacle, in the temple, there was an incense altar. And that altar was actually used more than the altar of burnt offerings, because that was. The incense offerings were the basis of the daily cycle, right. At morning and evening with. With prayers. And so incense is taken to this altar and is offered. And the language that's used about the aroma and the smell rising up is the same language that's used about the aroma of the burnt offerings rising up and. And the smell."}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":5591.02,"end":5598.46,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"So there's that peace where it's being offered as this pleasing aroma. It's being offered with prayer. Prayers are being attached to it."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":5599.66,"end":5606.14,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"So it's just pleasing that you're trying to please the God, just as you're trying to please someone you're offering hospitality to."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":5606.46,"end":5609.82,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Right. You're going to ask someone for a favor, you bring them a gift. Right?"}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":5610.22,"end":5611.26,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Yeah, right."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":5611.26,"end":5645.21,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"That's right. And so that's the one side, and then the other side of incense offering is there were censors, just like we have now in the Orthodox church in the ancient world, that were. They took various forms, but they were basically mobile means of offering incense. Right. Incense altar is a fixed thing, at least relatively. So you would come and you would take some of the coals and some of the incense from the altar and place them in a sensor."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":5645.93,"end":5646.33,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Right."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":5647.05,"end":5686.67,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Is how it was done. And then the sensor could be used to carry that incense to other places. And that could be used in what was called in Mesopotamian religion, fumigation rituals. Right. Because the idea was you were sort of smoking out the area in order to render it sacred and pure. And the Egyptians are really specific about this. They believed that there were sort of aerial spirits, literally, there were spirits in the air that might be malicious or at least tricksters, and had to be sort of driven out of the presence of the God of the temple."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":5686.99,"end":5696.11,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Right. So this is like setting off a bug bomb in your house and all the cockroaches go scattering. Right. Except they're demonic cockroaches."}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":5703.47,"end":5705.39,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"So, Right."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":5705.71,"end":5724.01,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"It's. That cleans out the area. So there's this purification element. And just a note, if you understand this, you know why you got to keep scooping that incense during services. If you could still see clearly. It's not enough anyway."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":5724.09,"end":5724.81,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"There you go."}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":5731.45,"end":5734.97,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"But I totally agree. And."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":5735.37,"end":5773.71,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"And this is. This is so embedded. I mentioned earlier that the sort of the. At the Ur level, the. The Greek words that describe religion are borrowed Semitic words that ultimately come out of Akkadian roots. So the oldest altar we know of at the Lycaon in Greece is. Was referred to throughout Greek history as the bemos, which is from bima, the Semitic root, which is the word for altar. And in Greek, it just became the name of that particular one because they lost sight of the etymology."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":5774.35,"end":5774.91,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Yeah."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":5775.23,"end":5788.67,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"But more pertinent to this is the Greek word kathiro, which is the verb for to cleanse or to purify. Catharsis."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":5789.04,"end":5791.6,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Yeah, right. Catharsis. Yeah, yeah, yeah."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":5792.64,"end":5815.76,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"And so. And that word is derived from the. The Semitic Qatar, which is usually transliterated as qtr. It's Qatar, the verb in Hebrew and just the root cutter in. In ugaritic. And that is the verb that means to offer incense."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":5816.68,"end":5838.12,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Yeah. So it's interesting that some of these key sacrificial terms, as you said, come from these Semitic practices of the ancient near east and then make their way even into Indo European languages like Greek get borrowed, straight in and sort of Hellenized or Latinized or whatever the case."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":5838.44,"end":5847.17,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Right. And so to sense something is not to metaphorically cleanse it. To cleanse something is to metaphorically sense it."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":5848.29,"end":5849.01,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Mic drop."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":5849.49,"end":5852.53,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Yeah, yeah, it's exactly inverted."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":5852.77,"end":5857.65,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Yeah. Right, right. That's gonna go on a T shirt too."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":5857.89,"end":5860.53,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Yeah, yeah. It's catchy."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":5862.85,"end":5867.09,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"It's a chiasm. It's a chiasmus. Sorry. It's a chiasmus. So it's got to be catchy."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":5867.89,"end":5899.84,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"So that brings us to too. And I think this is going to lead into what we're going to talk about in our next two episodes. That. Yeah, you see this clearly with incense. We're going to see this with all forms of sacrifice in the Old Testament, the New Testament atonement, that there are these two elements. The one element that is usually described by the Latin term propitiation. Propitiate. To propitiate someone means to make them propitious. And to be propitious means to be happy or well disposed or pleased towards someone."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":5900.32,"end":5906.72,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Yeah. Not a word we tend to use in Everyday speech, you know. How are you doing today? I'm very propitious, actually. Thank you."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":5907.12,"end":5912.24,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Yeah. I actually find the word propitious to be quite propinquent to my everyday life."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":5912.4,"end":5912.8,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"But."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":5916.96,"end":5934.26,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"So that's what propitiation means. Just means to please someone to make them happy. Right, right. Whether they were angry before or not, you're pleasing them and making them happy. And then the other element that's usually described by the Latin word expiation, which is like purification."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":5934.58,"end":5935.3,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Yeah, right."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":5935.3,"end":5944.9,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"There are these two elements, and these are present in all sacrifices. We can see them in incense offerings. We'll see them in the other sacrifices that we're going to go on to talk about."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #013 - 2021-02-11 - Eating with the Gods","start":5945.46,"end":6175.93,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Yeah, yeah. Well, this has been our first episode of three, and so we're just going to give some closing thoughts here, and we appreciate all of those of you who are anticipating our next couple episodes. This is. This is so fun already. So I'm just. I don't know, I'm just happy to be here. But I just wanted to say, you know about this context of pagan worship that we've been discussing. You know, if you listen closely, if you know anything, especially about orthodox Christian worship, there are probably a whole bunch of times during this episode where you thought, wait, wait, I know that word, or I know that action or whatever. And then we didn't make the connection for you. We're going to make those connections for you. But we wanted to lay this specific groundwork here initially. And it's not just about a kind of heuristic progression. Right. It's really about, again, reorienting the way that we understand what it is that we do, and reorienting the way that we understand what we ought to be doing. Right. And how we ought to be doing it. When you understand that sacrifice in the ancient world does what we just described, and when you understand how it's conducted, then it kind of makes a sort of flat, secular worldview almost impossible. Right. You can't. Once you know that you can have a meal with your God and be in communion with your God, then that takes what it means to be a religious person, or Christian in particular, completely out of the realm of this is what I think and feel and believe. Right. Although those are important things. It's much more primal and visceral, no pun intended. It gets you down in the stomach, quite frankly. I think that that's a really important place to aim when you're talking about the stuff that actually is the most important. I mean, I'm being a little redundant here, but the kind of faithfulness that keeps you returning to God over and over again, the kind of faithfulness that is always making your love for Jesus Christ grow is the kind of faithfulness that even connects to your body, which is very much an element of who you are. And I'm talking about the material body here. Right. And that there is the whole human person is brought into contact with God through exactly what we've been talking about. Now, we've been talking about it in terms of pagans, but if you listened closely, I'm sure you heard a lot of stuff that has everything to do with also the worship of the one true God. And that continuity should leap right out at you. And we're going to get to that a lot more in the next couple episodes. But just tonight, we want to just sort of show you what does worship in the ancient world look like. And you probably notice it does not look like what a lot of people call worship now. And it universally looks almost the same in every culture, with just some adjustments here and there. But it's always centered on the offering of food and sharing it with your God, the accompaniment with incense to both please your God and to purify the space and the actions that you're engaging in. So this is really, really important stuff, everybody. And I, I hope that this has been valuable for you, Father."}

And this may seem kind of disconnected. Right. This isn't just, you know, that I should be allowed to shoot my mouth off and I should have a call in show, and everyone should listen to my interesting opinions about fascinating old historical stuff, because, frankly, other than, you know, the handful of nerds like me who would be expected to care about what things were like in. In 10,000 BC. But the reality is this. This cuts to a big part of our mission in this podcast as a whole. And we've talked before about how disconnected modern and postmodern life is now, sort of digitally disconnected, and how disconnected from just reality we've become and how this has affected how we view meaning and our lives and the world, how it's affected human morality, human sexuality, you know, the human understanding of God and of religion, this sort of disconnection there. There are four main ways that humans interact with religion, reality. The first one's language. And we're pretty Good at that. We're very much in our heads. We're very linguistically oriented. When we go to worship services in the Orthodox Church or elsewhere, we focus really hard on the words and try to determine what they mean. Then there's music and art are the next two. And those have been lost to varying degrees, and we try to rediscover them. But the fourth one has almost been completely lost by modern humans. And that's ritual. Ritual is not just, you know, smells and bells. We were talking about incense. It's not just a performance, a sort of theatrical performance that I enjoy watching. It's not something that induces an emotional experience in me. It's a way of connecting with reality. And that's why we see that worship, and especially sacrificial worship, especially sacrifice, this community building around sacred and shared meals and hospitality is something that is basically human. The earliest humans we can find evidence of were practicing it. Humans today can still practice it if we find our way back to it. And this is a way for us to reconnect with the whole element of reality to which we are least now connected, which is the spiritual reality around us. One of the questions we get asked a lot is, okay, I believe what you're saying on the show is true, but how do I really connect with that? Ritual is way. Yeah, right. Ritual is the way when we. When we attend Orthodox church services as they're conducted, this isn't just something that's being presented to us to watch or to hear or to think about. It's something to participate in. And that participation will produce actual communion. It will make us into a community with one another. It will bind us together with our fellow Christians and will bind all of us as Christians and our Christian communities together with our God, with our Lord and God and Savior, Jesus Christ. That's what this is all aimed at. And so it's not just about me showing off interesting stuff I learned from books about Neolithic religion and boring lectures. I sat through that you don't want to. It's about finding our way back into reality and reconnecting with it and reconnecting with God in a real experiential way so that all of this becomes real and true to us and not just something we think or believe."}

Stephen DeYoung, a listener supported presentation of Ancient Folk Faith Radio and I beheld and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne, and the beasts and the elders, and the number of them was 10,000 times 10,000 and thousands of thousands, saying with a loud voice, worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and Blessing. Revelation chapter 5, verses 11 through 12."}
