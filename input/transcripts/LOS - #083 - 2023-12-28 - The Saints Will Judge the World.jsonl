And he will be the light of the nations and the hope of those whose hearts are troubled. All who dwell on the earth will fall down and worship him. And they will praise and bless and celebrate with song the lord of spirits. First Enoch, chapter 48, verses 4 through 5. The modern world doesn't acknowledge, but is nevertheless haunted by spirits and angels, demons and saints. In our time, many yearn to break free of the prison of a flat secular materialism, to see and to know reality as it truly is. What is this spiritual reality like? How do we engage with it? Well, how do we permeate everyday life with spiritual presence? Orthodox Christian priests Father Andrew Stephen Damick and Fr. Stephen DeYoung host this live call in show focused on enchantment in creation, the union of the seen and unseen as made by God and experienced by mankind throughout history. Welcome to the Lord of Spirits."}

We've been asked about this a lot, actually, and especially our Protestant friends might find the orthodox practice of having patron saints for people, places, churches, groups, etc. Kind of weird and frankly, unbiblical. Is it, though? Is there a biblical basis for this element of Christian life? What about those who say that this is just a whitewashing of pagan polytheism? You love alliteration. Calling upon various gods for different purposes. What do we do with the similarities between how pagans treat their gods and how Christians relate to patron saints?

This is not just me taking a shot at our Protestant friends about the coherency, or lack thereof, of sola scriptura. But to say we have to approach this kind of thing when we're looking at a historic practice of the Church, which we know without a doubt is a practice that went back to at least the end of the first, beginning of the second century.

So what we have to do is we have to look at how the Bible talks about, uses the word that gets translated as saint. Right. How that word is used, how the people to whom that is applied or discussed, how they're related to, and various other things to determine. Oh, okay. So this is, this is the structure of what was believed and taught and experienced by the, the first hearers of this text. Right. This is, this is how they understood reality to function. This is how they encountered God, how they experienced God, how they worshiped God. Right. That's going to be reflected in the text and the way the text speaks.

And it doesn't mean that the pattern isn't important. Right. Because again, it's not setting out a guide, it's not sending out a manual. And so the fact that the particular way in which humans relate to departed saints in its every detail is not laid out anywhere in the Scriptures, or at least not in any one place especially, doesn't mean there was no such relationship. Right. People just stopped thinking about their dead Christian loved ones. Right. Or right. They did something at funerals."}

And so now we're going to bring back again, we're digging in the crates in the old episodes, but a great quote from philo of Alexandria, 1st century BC Jewish writer who summarizes this. He's commenting in this quote. He's commenting on Deuteronomy chapter 4, verse 19. So we're going to hear Deuteronomy 4:19 first and then what Philo says about it and the language he uses."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #083 - 2023-12-28 - The Saints Will Judge the World","start":2561.01,"end":2798.49,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Yeah, okay. So here's the Deuteronomy quote. And beware, lest you raise your eyes to heaven. And when you see the sun and the moon and the stars, all the hosts of heaven, you be drawn away and bow down to them and serve them things that the Lord your God has allotted to all the peoples under the whole heaven. So that's the Deuteronomy quote. And here's what Philo has to say about this. And remember the basic rule, everybody. Commentary is always longer than the original text. So here's Philo. Some persons have conceived that the sun and the moon and the other stars are independent gods, to whom they have attributed the causes of all things that exist. But Moses was well aware that the world was created and was like a very large city, having rulers and subjects in it. The rulers being all the bodies which are in heaven, such as planets and fixed stars, and the subjects being all the natures beneath the moon, hovering in the air and adjacent to the earth. But that the rulers aforesaid are not independent and absolute, but are the viceroys of one supreme being, the Father of all, in imitation of whom they administer with propriety and success, the charge committed to their care, as he also presides over all things in strict accordance with justice and with law. Others, on the contrary, who have not discovered the supreme governor who thus rules everything, have attributed the causes of the different things which exist in the world to the subordinate powers, as if they had brought them to pass by their own independent act. But the most sacred lawgiver changes their ignorance into knowledge, speaking in the following. Thou shalt not when thou seest the sun and the moon and the stars, and all the host of heaven be led astray and fall down and worship them with great felicity and propriety. Has he here called the reception of these bodies as gods, an error. For they who see that the different seasons of the year owe their existence to the advances and retreats of the sun, in which periods also the generation of animals and plants and fruits are perfected according to well defined times, and who see also that the moon is the servant and successor of the sun, taking that care and superintendence of the world by night which the sun takes by day, and also that the other stars, in accordance with their sympathy with things on earth, labor continually and do 10,000 things which contribute to the duration of the existing state of things, have been led into an inextricable error, imagining that these bodies are the only gods. And then. So we're skipping a little bit here. We must therefore look on all those bodies in the heaven which the outward sense regards as gods, not as independent rulers, since they are assigned the work of lieutenants, being by their intrinsic nature responsible to a higher power, but by reason of their virtue not actually called to render in an account of their doings. So that, transcending all visible essence, by means of our reason, let us press forward to the honour of that everlasting and invisible being who can be comprehended and appreciated by the mind alone, who is not only the God of all gods, whether appreciable only by the intellect or visible to the outward senses, but is also the creator of them all. And if anyone gives up the service due to the everlasting and uncreated God, transferring it to any more modern and created being, let him be set down as mad and as liable to the charge of the greatest impiety. And that's from his special laws 1, 3. One of the things I note here is he both says that you shouldn't think of the heavenly bodies as gods, and also they're gods, but they're under the one, the most high God."}

Which, if you remember again, this is hearkening back to our very earliest episodes. If you remember that God, in its most basic sense, in most ancient languages means ruler, then you can understand how he can both say they're not really gods and they're only subordinate gods. In other words, they're not actually the ones in charge, but they've been put in charge of some things by the one who is in charge. That's what that means. And that's why there's even that phrase false gods in scripture. Like they're false rulers. Not that they don't exist, they're just not really in charge Right."}

But in this case, right. Again, there's no necessity. There's no necessity to create anything at all. To create full stop. Or to create anything or anyone in particular. Right? But God has chosen out of love to share his divine life, to share his divine nature, to share himself with creatures. And the beginning of that, of course, is creating them, right? And then after creating them, it becomes sharing, sharing his life with them. That's why."}

And so because of that, we find. And we find examples of this in the scriptures in different places. We find that there are angelic beings who are assigned to elements of the natural order, like the sun and moon and stars in Deuteronomy 419, or the devil having been referred to as the prince and power of the air. We find this with reference to peoples, meaning people groups, groups of people, tribes, clans, later on, nations have angelic beings or spirits assigned to them. Think of Daniel, the Prince of Persia, right? The Prince of Greece, St. Michael, who is Israel's prince, right? And we find angelic beings assigned to particular people, what we've come to call, like guardian angels, right? But who are assigned to shepherd and guide individual people. You read the Book of Tobit with Saint Raphael as an example. But this is what you find the holy ones, the angelic beings being assigned to all of these elements. Right. But these are three quick categorizations, right? Elements of the natural order, people groups and persons."}

I had about half this much gray in my beard. The show's taking a lot out of me. Anyway, so in that, we talked about how, you know, we've. We've.

But then Origen, if I understand this correctly, is not considered a saint. So I was wondering, like, how that works, and I guess then how that works for all of us. Like, how right do you have to be if you have to be a certain percentage of right?"}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #083 - 2023-12-28 - The Saints Will Judge the World","start":4309.33,"end":4378.2,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"That's a great way to put it. Well, you know, I'll say this, number one, being a heretic. I mean, I know that word gets used in a number of ways, but in its technical sense, being a heretic means you have been condemned by the appropriate authorities for not just thinking or just saying something that's wrong, but teaching it right. Like, you are setting yourself up as a teacher of this heretical teaching. Right? Because, I mean, you know, if you go to coffee hour in any Orthodox church and people start to discuss theology, you're going to hear some heresies. Like it's going to come out. People. Because people think all kinds of wrong things, and they could. Sometimes they say them, but that doesn't mean that they're teaching them. That doesn't mean that they're, you know, doing that. And. And even if they are teaching it, maybe that just gets sort of corrected by their local parish priest, and there's no council that declares them a heretic."}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #083 - 2023-12-28 - The Saints Will Judge the World","start":4380.52,"end":4398.49,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"So. So, yeah, you can't. I mean, there is a certain sense in which you can accidentally do a heresy, but, like, it's like saying, you know, am I a traitor to the United States of America even though I've never been convicted of treason? I mean, you could be right."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #083 - 2023-12-28 - The Saints Will Judge the World","start":4398.49,"end":4399.01,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"It's possible."}

So, yeah, there's a certain amount of juridical definition that comes along with that, where there's actually been someone that's examined you and all of that stuff comes along. Is it possible to say wrong things and also to be a canonized saint? Yes. Yes, it is."}

I mean, everybody says something's wrong, you know, and even sometimes they write it down. I mean, we have saints who, like, they get later in their life, they say, oh, please, you know, please don't read the stuff that I wrote earlier. It's like they themselves admit that they said wrong things early on that might even be heretical in the sense of being a wrong teaching. So it's really about how you end up and how you are assessed by the church. Right. Is what it comes down to being. That's what I have to say about that. I don't know, Father Stephen."}

Because if we're talking about soteriology, if we're talking about salvation, the ideas in your head have nothing to do with salvation."}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #083 - 2023-12-28 - The Saints Will Judge the World","start":4533.72,"end":4577.23,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Right. And as St. James tells us in his Epistle, all the demons know there's one God. Right? They all know that Jesus Christ is his Son. Right. They all know that he died and rose again. They don't just think it. They don't just. They know it for a fact. That doesn't do them any good. Right. This is. This is something that comes out of a certain form of Evangelical Protestantism. Right? This idea that the ideas in your head decide whether you're a good person or a bad person. This has recently been secularized as woke liberalism, which also believes that what makes you a good or a bad person is the ideas you have in your head."}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #083 - 2023-12-28 - The Saints Will Judge the World","start":4583.21,"end":4657.96,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Right. So we're not talking about. So we're talking about saint. So part of the church glorifying someone as a saint is that the church is saying, this is a Person to be emulated. This is a person who shows us how to live the Christian life successfully. Right. The purpose of them being glorified as a saint, them being on the calendar of the saints. Right. Is that this person's life, they lived in a certain way such that it could serve as an example. This is why you read what Saint Photius the Great said about Saint Augustine. Right. Saint Augustine is a saint, not because the Orthodox Church has embraced swaths of his theology, but because of the Confessions, because of the life he lived. Right. Yeah. So you could be wrong about a lot of things because as we've talked about in the show as recently as last episode, ideas don't cause anything. You could have all kinds of wrong ideas and still live a beautiful life following Christ."}

If they wrote down any of those mistaken things, they don't get preserved. Right. They're sort of considered unworthy of the person and so they kind of die out over time. St. Augustine was uniquely unfortunate in that regard. I mean, the man, St. Augustine wrote a whole book just retracting things that he had published."}

And how we see several discrete places in Scripture that refer to angelic fall, what we might call angelic falls. We're not going to rehash all that now. Right. List them all. The five is fallout. All that. Right. But this has raised a bunch of questions. Right. And I think a lot of the questions we get concerning this are generated primarily by that word fall and what that actually means.

We'll get concrete with this, right? So you have. We talked about how there are. There were angelic beings, right, that were assigned to elements of the natural order, to peoples like people groups and to persons like people. What does it mean for an angelic being with one of those quote unquote assignments, Right. The spirit is playing the role of animating those things. What does it mean for them to fall? Right.

So we've mentioned, for example, and I think the terms we used, again, this may be part of the issue, right. Is, for example, the angelic beings who are assigned to people groups, like after the Tower of Babel event, right. Deuteronomy 32. Eight and all that that we've talked about before, that they, in some cases, depending at, like Saint Dionysius the Areopagite, all of them, except for Israel, didn't perform their intended function, Right? All of them, except for Israel fell. And we talked about that in terms of accepting worship from people. And I think that language may be a little too external, right. Because I think that language plays into this view that, like, okay, well, this angelic being is like up in the sky somewhere, and he's supposed to be kind of overseeing them, and they decide to start sacrificing cattle to him. And he says, hey, this is cool. And so he starts telling them to do evil stuff, right?"}

Yeah. Right. Even if he's just speculating, it is wrong. How is he thinking about the issue? How is he thinking about the relationship between the angelic power that becomes the devil and the created order? Right. So something happens with this spirit that is guiding and producing the harmony of the created order. And so that harmony is broken. And so you have animals turning on and eating each other and attacking each other. Right. You have. Right. This is the way of thinking. I think that's important there, that. That underlies this understanding that we're trying to get across. And so in one sense. Right? In one sense, when these angelical powers or these spiritual powers rebel or fall or fall or whatever language we want to use, this leaves these vacancies, as it were. Right. In the divine. This. In the divine economy. Right. In this sort of administration we were talking about in the first half. Right. In that there are not holy ones anymore in those positions because they have fallen from what they were supposed to be doing at the same time. Right. They aren't vacancies in the sense that, well, all those demonic powers now get thrown down to hell and don't have any influence or don't do anything. Right, Right. Even though they're now fallen in the sense of being turned to evil, of having left God's administration having ceased to be, creatures who are administering the will of God in his creation and are instead doing the opposite, are trying to bring about the destruction of God's creation, they are still associated with the elements of the natural order or the peoples or the persons."}

The language that's used for them, for example, in the Book of Enoch that we talk about all the time, they're referred to as shepherds. The 70 sons of God are referred to as the 70 shepherds in the animal apocalypse in. In the Book of Enoch, they're supposed to be shepherd. I think Saint Dionysius uses this language too. They were meant to shepherd the people groups, the people to God after the human fall back to God. Right. And so this is. This was their purpose. Right. So because we focused on the sun Moon and stars in the natural order. At the beginning you might have gotten this idea of like, you know, the modern sense of the clockwork universe. And they're sort of. Right. Ghosts in the machine. Right. But this is peoples and people too, with agency. Right, yeah. The national order includes animal life and plant life and. Right. And all of these things. So it's a more dynamic relationship than that. And so it was this shepherding of bringing back into harmony. Right. Bringing back to God, restoring or that was their purpose. Right. And they're guiding to a relationship that within the Scriptures is ultimately defined by the idea of a covenant. And that covenant is over and over again referred to as a marriage. Right."}

Right. And that, that marriage is then expected to be chaste and often isn't on one side. Right. It is on God's side, but often on the other side isn't. Right. And so then in terms of understanding, again, the fallen demonic powers, we have to understand that as the opposite of this, that they decide to shepherd humanity towards someone and something else. Those who are being shepherded toward God become like God. Those who are being shepherded away become like the demonic powers. And so there are these demonic shepherds. Right. And because we like reading it and because people freak out when we read it and resort to special pleading, we're going to come back to the quote from St. John Chrysostom."}

I repeat, it is not so. For not the souls of those who die a violent death become demons, but rather the souls of those who live in sin. Not that their nature is changed, but that in their desires they imitate the evil nature of demons. Showing this very thing to the Jews. Christ said, ye are the children of the devil. And that's a reference to John 7:44. He said that they were the children of the devil, not because they were changed into a nature like his, but because they performed actions like his. Wherefore also, he adds, for the lusts of your Father you will do.

And it's, you know, not coincidental that it's the lusts of their father that they do because. Right. If the covenant into which we're shepherded by angelic beings is compared to marriage, then this consorting with demons is always compared to fornication. Yeah, right. It's always compared to fornication. We know that in many cases, like with the giant clans. Right. And pagan forms of worship, it literally involved fornication."}

That is. Right. Returning to God. Yeah, right. So, right. This is sort of the, the state of affairs that comes into being again that we have in the Hebrew Bible in the Old Testament. Right. And then within the prophetic tradition contained therein, there is going to be a solution to this. And this brings us Back to Psalm 82 or 81 in the Greek, which we sing on Holy Saturday as the gospel hymn, followed by a certain reading from the gospel of St. Matthew that we're also going to talk about right here in the same context. Again, not a coincidence that these two things are brought together in a resurrection service that talks about literally the death of the gods. God stands in the council of the gods amidst of them. He brings judgment. Right. He says you were to administer the nations injustice. Right. You were to carry out these assignments. You did the opposite. You were wicked."}

This is another thing that is incompatible with the other interpretation, with, arise, O God, and judge the earth, for thou wilt inherit from all the nations. Yeah, right. Which refers to a fundamental that after this judgment against the gods, this then opens the way to God. And the word inheritance is incredibly important. Israel is God's inheritance. This is the language that's used in Deuteronomy when the nations are divided is that Yahweh chose Israel for his inheritance. Right. So, and this says that after the judgment of the gods, now there is this shift in God is going to inherit from all the nations. Not inherit all the nations, but from all the nations, which is important if we understand St. Paul. Right. And what's going on with him bringing Gentiles into Christianity."}

And as I mentioned, we, we sing this psalm as the gospel hymn on holy Saturday as the lead into us reading Matthew 28, the end of Matthew 28, the end of St. Matthew's gospel, when Christ right before the ascension says, all authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.

We'll get to that in a second, but not in a second, in a little bit in the third half. And so just like with the angelic beings, what would we expect. What would we expect to find based on this dynamic that plays out in Scripture both in the Old Testament and then is fulfilled in Christ? Well, we would expect that the saints in glory, that human saints, human holy ones, we'd expect that they would be assigned to elements of the natural order to peoples, like people groups, to persons.

But again, you can't let your spiritual life be guided by comfort and discomfort. That's. That is a way that ends in disaster spiritually. So a final note here.

There's a section, Religion of the Apostles, talking about it. But it's very clear when you dig into it, when you look at how St. Paul uses the dead as opposed to just dead without the article that when St. Paul uses the article, the dead is referring to like the dead in Christ. Right? To departed Christians. And the word that's used there for. Right. Baptism for the dead is not really in the place of. It's more on behalf of or with benefit to. And the idea here is that this is literally a patron relationship in the Roman sense. Right. In the sense that there is someone in whose name you do things primarily as an act of humility. Right. Such that the honor for those things goes to the patron. Right. You're the one doing the work. You're the one doing the things. But your patron, right. In a Romans, it would be sponsoring them and therefore receive the glory for them. But in this sense it's sort of a voluntarily. So this is referring to the practice of, which is obviously still an orthodox practice today, of taking a saint's name at baptism."}

And as we just said, some of those subsystems communicate with the environment and some of them are self guided and self processing, right. Within the whole. Right. And so the consciousness that we ascribe to the organism is really an overarching consciousness of these sort of mini rudimentary. Right. Like my, my, my gut flora may have the level of consciousness of like a plant, right. This rudimentary consciousness, but that's still part of my overall consciousness. Right. And what do I mean by that? Well, trust me, the state of your gut flora can affect your mood. Oh yeah, right. Read some of St. Gregory the Theologians poetry when he was having stomach troubles.

And so the end result is that there is, there is some level of consciousness that arises out of any ordered system that transmits and or processes information. Yeah. Right. Now by some level of consciousness again, right? Think about the plants, right? Think about very simple animals or things like sea anemones that are somewhere in between, right? We're not saying they all have human consciousnesses, right? We're not saying like I am going to go and speak to the Earth because plate tectonics is an ordered system, find out what the earth wants, right? That's not what we're saying. We're talking about rudimentary levels of consciousness, but they're there. And so once we understand that, that there are these levels of consciousness below the level of human consciousness, there's no reason, right, for anyone. And now I'm speaking outside of even religious terms, right. There's no reason for anyone of any religion or no religion at all to reject the idea that there could be conscious levels of consciousness above humans, above an individual human person. Right? There's no reason for that. Now Christianity teaches us certain things about those levels of consciousness, right? Spiritual beings, angelic beings, right. The saints and glory, everything We've been talking about this episode. But even on a purely materialist basis, there's no logical reason to exclude the possibility of those things existing. Yeah, right. In some sense, in some form, right? So there's this, this higher level of consciousness. And so as the Examples we were giving before, right. You have a people group. That people group has a collective spirit. Right. There's this collective consciousness of the whole that is not just the sum of the parts."}

Right. And I don't mean your. What your definition of is is, but what it means to come into existence. So the way we usually use that way, I think it's being used in the question, at least most of the time, is it's being used. Come into existence as in ex nihilo. Right. Like previously there was nothing. Now there is a thing. Yeah, right. In the universe. And that idea that. That temporal transition right. Between there's this second in time and this place in space that is empty, and then that in another moment of time, that space is filled with something. Right. You can see how there's a problem with applying that to a spirit because a spirit doesn't have material existence that occupies space and time. Right. So if you mean existence in terms of material reality, material existence, do spirits come into material existence? Well, no, sort of definitionally."}

We have these five, four, maybe five. That's why five ish points, right. In what would be described as human history, we're not going to get it. Other episodes we've talked about what sense of history we're talking about with the scriptures. But in Scripture, at these five points in human existence, there are points where angelic beings are said to fall. And we talked about what that means in the last half. Yeah, right. And so one of the questions we get then is like, how, how does that mean, you know, the day before the angel was a good angel doing its thing, and then that day evil. Right. And, and we, we've tried in various ways to make the point like. No, because see there, you're assuming an angel is like a human. You're assuming what it's like to be an angel. Right? Angels, because they don't have material bodies, experience time and space differently than we do. And we don't know how differently because we don't know what it's like to be an angel. But we know it's different than the way that we as beings with material bodies experience time and space. Right?

They started to experience. Humans started to experience that after the Tower of Babel. Right. And so that's when it gets written about. Right.

And in those circles where that Father Andrew was referring to, where that term was used, it got really watered down to mean like fellowship, like coffee hour. But this is a much more important term in, in classical Greek, for example, it's used. This is the term Plato uses to describe the relationship between the forms and things, participation, to take part In. Right. That's how it's often translated. This is the term that St. Paul uses when he says, you know what, what the nation sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons and not to God. I do not you to want you to become kinonia. I do not want you to become participants with demons. Yeah. Right. So this describes a potential relationship you can have with demons for St. Paul, brought about in part at least through pagan sacrifice. Right.

This participation works in both directions. Right. Both top down and bottom up. As we said, it's not just top down. It's not that the spirit comes and possesses a group of people. Right.

But what. What does it mean? Right. It means that we look back at the Church's history and we see that there are places where humans were synergizing, were in sync, where their wills were aligned, where their activities were aligned with the Holy Spirit, with what God was doing in the world. Right. That they're being guided by the Holy Spirit. They were speaking, but they were being guided by the Holy Spirit."}

And we point at those places and we say these places are authoritative for us in the sense that these places in history serve as guides for us as we seek to do the same thing. Right? As we seek to do the same thing. So the ecumenical councils, certain writings of certain church fathers, because remember, we don't have all of them. We don't have writings of all the church fathers who could potentially be considered church fathers. We don't have all the writings of any given church father. Right. We have the ones that have come down to us through tradition, the copying of the Scriptures, right down to the ages, the canon of scripture, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. These are all places where humans were synergizing with the Holy Spirit. And so that fact and that recognition from us means that they're authoritative in guiding us to do the same. Right.

Okay. So Hagel, when Hegel talks about spirit, Hegel is actually very clear. He means the Holy Spirit. Hegel was a Lutheran. And if you don't understand that Hegel is a Lutheran, self described. He always insisted he was an orthodox Lutheran. And if you don't understand that he's a Lutheran, you won't understand Hegel correctly because he's really Lutheran. But he means the Holy Spirit. But, but Hegel worked in a, in, in the opposite direction. Hegel understood history as having a through line. And Hegel is vastly influential late 19th, throughout the 20th century in theology and philosophy, just about everything, right. History has this through line. It's going somewhere, it's progressing in a direction. Of course, 19th century Germany and 19th century German Lutheranism were the peak of that, at least for that point. Right.

But liberal theology essentially, like Hegel, takes whatever point in time they stand at as being the apex of history to that point. Right. This means I've critiqued it this way on the show before, but I'm going to do it again. This means that liberal theology is always innately, innately chauvinist, at least somewhat racist, colonial.

That's the only critique that's valid from their, based on their own presuppositions. Any critique from tradition is going to fall flat on its face, right? Because they've substituted instead of our understanding for tradition. They have this Hegelian understanding of history. And so trying to talk tradition doesn't work. Right?

This takes place in time and space. And that's because of this synergistic understanding. Right. So one of the concrete examples we've used repeatedly on the show is Saint Demetrius in Thessaloniki replacing Aphrodite as the spirit of the people and of the place and of the polity of the police. Right. And that is something that happened in real time, at least in terms of the human experience of it. Yeah, right, yeah. The phenomenological experience of it. Right. The gospel came there and Saint Demetrius was part of the gospel coming there. Right. Started with St. Paul, of course, but. Right. And part of the process. And the people of Thessaloniki began to realign themselves. Not with Aphrodite. Right. There was a time where it was all Aphrodite and then it starts to move. Right. And over time realign themselves with St. Demetrius, who is shepherding them back to God, who had aligned himself with the Holy Spirit and by aligning with him, right. Like St. Paul said, imitate me as I imitate Christ. Right. They were brought into alignment with God. Right. And so the Spirit who was motivating them, who was shepherding them, Right. Became Saint Demetrius and ceased being Aphrodite. This played out in real time. Right. And that's what we mean by it playing out in real time in this phenomenological sense in the lives of people. Right. And so this can, as we've been asked, move back and forth. Right. You look at the sweep of much of history since Christ's ascension, and it was moving kind of in one direction with Christendom and everything. Right.

Well, there's really two, and they're intimately connected. Of course. The first question is, what does salvation really mean? Because I think sometimes people might, if you bring up patron saints, especially if they're not from a tradition where this is a thing, again, you know, these are mostly our Protestant friends. I mean, I was raised Protestant myself. This was not part of our tradition when I was in. In that world, patron saints might seem like, well, it's this side issue. Like, you know, it's not really. If you're not against it, maybe you, at least you might say, well, it's not really that important for salvation. Right. So, number one, you know, as an orthodox Christian, I believe that the saints assist in salvation, but that's not really why this is actually important. It's important because if you track the whole way, if you track all the stuff that we've said in this whole episode, what you see actually is that this is the trajectory of the Christian right. That to be saved means to be among those whom the scripture says the saints will judge the world, that the life of the age to come is subjected not to angels, but to humans, to glorified humans. Right? And so salvation itself is about becoming part of the divine council, a part of, to use sort of raw, er, language, the council of the gods. That's what it means to be saved. That's the trajectory of Christianity. That's its purpose, to become as Christ's. Again, I mean, I've referenced this. We've referenced this a gazillion times, the podcast, but it bears repeating. Christ says in Luke chapter 20 that the sons of the resurrection are sons of God and equal to the angels. That is not a side issue. That's the core. That's right there at the middle, right there in the very center of what it means to be Christian. Sons of the resurrection, sons of God, equal to the angels, right? And so when we look at the saints functioning as patrons, as spirits who influence and help to guide particular people, peoples, churches, nations, groups, places, whatever, they are simply doing the thing, that is where the ark of salvation goes. That's, that's the goal, that's the goal of the Christian life, is to function in that way, to share in God's stewardship, his love, his care for this cosmos. Right? And so the saints are simply people who are doing it. And the reason that they're doing it. This is the second question, you know, what do we therefore do now about this? The reason that they're doing it is because in this life and in the earthly life, that if you're listening to this, you're part of the earthly life, I'm part of the earthly life, that in this life they practiced it, in this life, they did it as much as they could. Now, obviously, their capability magnified infinitely in their passage into the life of the age to come. And that's why we experience them in what seems to be superhuman ways, but is actually not beyond humanity, but is the destiny of humanity like it's the most human way, right? We function subhumanly, they're functioning humanly. But while they were in this life and had to function subhumanly on some level, they practiced this as much as they could. They functioned to put this world into order and beauty and harmony and shepherded themselves and those around them towards God, towards that chaste marriage as we talked about earlier. And so all the things that we do in order to orient ourselves and our homes, our relationships, our jobs, our thoughts, our libraries, our gardens, our kids, I mean, go on and on, whatever you want to put in there. Everything that we do to do that is formational, transformational, to become what we see the saints doing now. That's the goal. That's what it means to be Christian. That is the purpose of Christianity is to be co enthroned with Christ, to be seated on those thrones next to him, to put the world with him in subordination to him, in order, just like we see happening in the Old Testament with the angels, just like we see happening very explicitly in Second Temple, Jewish literature, Philo, Jubilees, etc. Just like we see happening in the New Testament, just like we see happening in all of church history. That's what the goal is. And so the motivator of our Christian life now is to do that. And the beautiful thing is we don't do this in an isolated way. We have them to help us. And we have each other as well to help us. And we help each other so that we might be seated also in Christ at the right hand of God. Father STEPHEN."}

And the most basic spiritual warfare that I think most of us, or at least most of the people listening right now are called is expressly this. Some of us need to change the spirit that's hanging over us as a person. There's someone or something that we're following that's shepherding us, that's guiding us. We may think it's guiding us toward something like success or wealth or recognition or some feeling of fulfillment. It's not shepherding us toward destruction. And we should know that because as we follow it, as we follow its lead and take its guidance, what we're experiencing is isolation and alienation, resentment and jealousy, none of which are signs that we're moving in the right direction. And we need to replace that spirit with another, with one of the saints who will guide us back toward God, who will show us the way to live a life in this world. As many different lives as we live, as many different lives as the saints have led different places at different times to make our way back to God in and through this world and through our day to day life.

And we can tell it's the wrong one because our family life is marked with squabbling, bickering, resentments, anger, alienation, dysfunction. We need to find a way to replace that one with another. It's going to show our family and shepherd our family and how to live together as a family in a way that's pleasing to God and that will help all of us draw closer to God. Some of us may be we're struggling through it and our family's struggling through it, but maybe our church parish has a spirit that's guiding it, that's not the one whose name is on the door. Because again, there's division, there's resentment, there's a focus on money."}

And the work we need to do in our parish is to work on banishing that spirit, bringing back the one whose name is on the door."}

And maybe we've even got a parish that's not perfect, but we're all struggling together toward Christ. Maybe it's our neighborhood. Maybe it would be our neighborhood if we knew any of our neighbors. Maybe it's a Paul that's hanging over it. Maybe it's just people who have given up, people who are depressed, people who are despondent, people who don't have hope. You can tell when you're in that type of neighborhood. You can tell from the litter. You can tell from the way people's houses look. You can tell from the way they don't greet each other or talk to each other when they see each other. In all these cases, making that change, banishing the one spirit, exorcising the one spirit, and bringing in the other to be followed toward God isn't something you do with an elaborate ritual. It isn't something you do by being perfect yourself. Otherwise we'd all be in trouble. That's something you do by doing little things, little, small, seemingly inconsequential things over and over and over again. It's what happens when you go and you mow somebody's lawn, when you cook them a meal, when you see that their kids need new pairs of shoes so you buy them shoes or give them shoes that your kids have outgrown. When you sit and talk to them and you're kind to them, when you learn your neighbors names, where they're from, what they care about and what they're thinking and feeling. Just like with Thessaloniki that example we gave. It doesn't happen overnight, took centuries in Thessaloniki. You're not going to turn things around on a dime. You're not going to see immediate results. But slowly but surely, as we work to follow the angels and the saints, to follow them back to God, and to do that by doing the works of God in the lives of other people, who God has put in our life, has put in our path, change starts to happen. Pretty soon we're not the only one working on it. Pretty soon we have help. Pretty soon we have support, and things start to change a little more. And it goes on. And it goes on. And people and places and groups of people can be transformed this way. It's happened before. It's happened in the world through Christianity. It can happen again in our day, as horrible as we all think it is. But somebody has to make a start. Somebody has to start doing those little things. And if you're listening to this show tonight or you're hosting, it might as well be us. Those are my thoughts."}

And I beheld and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beasts and the elders. And the number of them was 10,000 times 10,000 and thousands of thousands, saying with a loud voice, worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and Blessing. Revelation, chapter 5, verses 11 through 12."}
