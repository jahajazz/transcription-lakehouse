And he will be the light of the nations and the hope of those whose hearts are troubled. All who dwell on the earth will fall down and worship him. And they will praise and bless and celebrate with song the lord of spirits. First Enoch, chapter 48, verses 4 through 5. The modern world doesn't acknowledge, but is nevertheless haunted by spirits and angels, demons and saints. In our time, many yearn to break free of the prison of a flat secular materialism, to see and to know reality as it truly is. What is this spiritual reality like? How do we engage with it? Well, how do we permeate everyday life with spiritual presence? Orthodox Christian priests Father Andrew Stephen Damick and Fr. Stephen DeYoung host this live call in show focused on enchantment in creation, the union of the seen and unseen as made by God and experienced by mankind throughout history.

I mean, there's no firm date. We're talking about the beginning of the first millennium BC. So we're talking roughly. Usually, people peg Homer around 800. Hesiod is probably a little earlier. And what Hesiod is doing is mostly compiling oral tradition, particularly related to Greek religion.

He makes abundantly clear that. I mean, assuming that there's a hymn there, just a single hymn, these works make abundantly clear that in these traditions, the Daemonis used to be people and used to be in particular, heroes.

That's why we had to talk about superheroes. Right. Like Superman is a superhero because he does all these exploits. Right. And say Hercules did all these exploits. Right. But that was at the core of what being a hero was. Usually you were part divine and part human. So these were quasi divine, quasi human beings who accomplished these feats and who, when they died, then became sort of their spirit, lived on and became a daemon that was involved in various spiritual activities. So in the. The. In Theogony997.997 is the line number, by the way, not a page number. Most early Greek texts, when you quote them with numbers, there's not like a single edition where there are page numbers. Right. You list the line numbers."}

They're from a particular collection of classics, but suffice to say, that's how it's listed. So this is line number 997 he talks about in the Theogony Phaeton becoming. Who was one of the heroes becoming a daemon. But then in works and Days, which is a lesser red hesiodic work, in lines 122 to 126, he talks about how Zeus transforms heroes and by them being transformed into daemon at the time of their death, they sort of become his children, if they weren't already. Now, some of them already were because, you know, Zeus is on the loose, dude. Got around. But even if they weren't directly, they sort of became them by virtue of. Of becoming daemons, worst moved by God ever. So, yeah, Zeus too, man. So you have this picture then of these sort of great men who are considered divine, at least partially. They die, their spirits then become spirits in the world. So one thing a lot of people don't know. I know we've mentioned it on the show before. I don't know how much depth we've gone into on it.

This is like a 20th century thing. It started in the. In the Enlightenment, but has really gained traction now. In the Enlightenment, they sort of wanted to cast the Greek philosophers in particular, and also Roman philosophers as being very much like them. So because, say, the French philosophes had decided that, oh, Roman Catholicism is base superstition that the rabble believe, right. We're above it.

He's like the most Lutheran guy in the world. If you read what he writes. Like, Luther would have looked at him and been like, dang, right. But somehow we got to read him in this way that he wasn't really religious because how could he possibly be? He was smart. Yes. Which is just a stupid and weird bias. Okay? But the way that works itself out in this discussion is they're like, well, wait, Socrates can't possibly have believed in demons. Right? Socrates is too smart. He can't have believed that there was some spirit whispering to his soul. He can't believe that. He must have just been talking about his own spirit. His own soul, Right?

The kernel of truth in that is that when you get into the late third and early fourth centuries, especially in the fourth century, where we're talking about the last generation of pagans, right. Of Greek and Roman pagans within the Roman Empire, paganism changed a lot over the course of that last 85 to 100 years. We talked about that in some recent episodes, like with Plotinus trying to sort of redo Platonism and make it more Christian. Ish. Right? But the same happened to paganism. They pretty much stopped sacrificing animals, for example. It was mostly incense and prayers and hymns and Stuff they. What does that sound like?"}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #103 - 2024-10-25 - Fiend Folio","start":2769.29,"end":2878.78,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"So they were shifting under the influence of Christianity to try to survive. Paganism became a very different thing. So when you look at some of those last generation pagan philosophers like Labanius and stuff, they may have very much interpreted those earlier texts that way because they were trying to find a more refined version of philosophy and paganism. Right. That would get around Christian critiques. Yeah, right. Of their beliefs. But it's very clear, it is abundantly clear, it is incontrovertibly clear that Socrates, Plato, Aristotle fully believed in. In demonis, fully believed in spirits, believed in a spiritual world, believed it literally. You know, Aristotle's academy was, it was. Or his school was inside a temple to Apollo. These were full blooded pagans. Right. Albeit of a very intellectual sort, you know, who intellectualized elements of their practice and that kind of thing. But we're very religious in their time and place. So if anybody comes to you with that interpretation, just know they're trying to retcon it because they're embarrassed by religion. That's why they're making that argument. But so as we mentioned, right, to sort of sum up what, what we've been talking about in this first half. Right. There was very much among Greek and Roman pagans this belief in people having a guardian devil, having a guardian demon, a genius that was associated with them, with whom they interacted over the course of their life. Yeah."}

Give them a call at 855-237-2346. That's 855-AF-RADIO. The centuries after the Protestant Reformation brought about a radical reinterpretation of The Epistles of St. Paul, disconnected from any historical reality. But Paul operated during his entire life as a faithful Pharisee within the Roman Jewish world. In St. Paul the Pharisee, Jewish apostle to all nations, Father Stephen DeYoung surveys Paul's life and writings, interpreting them within the holy tradition of the Orthodox Church. This survey is followed by DeYoung's interpretive translation of St. Paul's epistles, which deliberately avoids overly familiar terminology. By using words and ideas grounded in 1st century Judaism, DeYoung hopes to unsettle commonly held notions and help the reader reassess St. Paul in his historical context.

And I think that's another problem that I'm having with my modern brain is we have all these things that we say, well, that's not good or bad, it's just how you use it. Or, you know, I even look over the across, far, far across the aisle to Roman Catholicism, where they have like a patron saint of the Internet or the patron saying something that seems totally inane. Small shipping frigates or going fishing or whatever. Oh, it's not good or bad, but you can use it for good or bad. And we have this idea of neutrality built into everything, especially in marketing. They always look to use terms. They're like, well, we don't want you to judge or condemn. We just want you to say."}

So getting the postmodernism which you talked about last week. Everyone just has a perspective. It's all relative. It's not good or bad. So there's this neutrality that's just really built into the modern age. But C.S. lewis is very affirmative that we don't really have neutrality. Everything's good or bad. And there seems to be the prescription of. Sorry, the description given to us by Scripture. To me, you know, especially going into the song, the two paths, the sheep and the goats, there's a lot of. It's one way or the other. So can you talk about the orthodox perspective on what is neutrality? Where. Where does it exist in the world? Or is it an illusion? Do we even have neutrality?"}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #103 - 2024-10-25 - Fiend Folio","start":3540,"end":3698.89,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"I mean, so you're either being obedient to God or you're. Or you're not. But I think that one of the things I think maybe not obvious, as obvious to people is that obedience to God is actually way broader and more inclusive than disobedience. And. And by the. So, for instance, someone might say, well, you know, okay, I gotta take the trash out. That's not good or evil. That's just a thing that I have to do. But putting things in order and making them beautiful and cultivating them is literally Job one as given to Adam and Eve, right? So, like, you know, caretaking this world and doing the things that have to be done and putting them in order. This. These are the works that God gave us to do. That is an act of obedience, right? That is an act of faithfulness, Right? So, I mean, there are some things, of course, that it's. It's not that it's neutral in itself, but it is how you interact with it, right? So like a classic example would be drinking God. It says. It says in scripture that God makes wine, you know, for the gladness of the heart of man, but he didn't make it for drunkenness, you know, So I think part of the problem, of course, is that questions of good and evil are about human participation. They're not about a taxonomy of items. There's no. There's no knowledge that doesn't include some kind of participation, right? So, you know, the idea of, like, there is no spiritual neutrality. Often we think of certain actions as being neutral, but that's because we don't understand how they're either cooperating with God or. Or not. You know, a lot of that's probably just ignorance. Like I said, taking out the trash is an act of order and beauty. So, you know, do that, everybody. And therefore, you know, it's an act of faithfulness to God. You know, all those little things that we do to keep ourselves and our lives in order, these are acts of faithfulness to God. Holiness, really. I mean, they are acts of holiness. We might not think of them as religious, but that's not, that's not what the call is. It's not to do things that we classify in this list of churchy stuff. It's to do all the things that are obedience to the way that God made us to be and the things he calls us to do. I know. Father Stephen, do you have anything you wanted to add? Subtract, actually."}

Yeah, right. Those are. Those are separate categories. And the danger of confusing those two is you end up with Gnosticism, right, Where the material world is somehow evil. Right. I'll use the example of alcohol that you just gave, right? Because alcohol could be used for evil and may even be prevalently used to evil ends. That means alcohol is somehow evil in and of itself and to be done away with. Right? That's. That's the Gnostic slippage, right? Dancing. Right. Might. Might lead to something else and therefore it's evil. Right? That. That kind of thing. So nuclear power, right. You can use to create nearly infinite amounts of carbon neutral energy. Right. You can also use the same technology to massacre millions of innocent people. That doesn't mean that nuclear fission technology is neutral. Precisely. Right. It means that good or evil isn't a category that applies to nuclear fission technology. It applies to the use of. To which nuclear fission technology is put. Yeah, it's put to a good user, it's put to an evil use. But in and of itself, again, neutral implies that it could be good or evil in and of itself. Right. Even if you think of something that you would say, well, that's evil in and of itself. Like, let's say pornography. Right. Pornography is not really a thing. Pornography is a subset of photography or film or videos or. Right. And film, videos, photography, all have very good uses to which they're put, and then also very evil usages of which pornography is one."}

And what I have in my mind is, like, trying to get a grasp on their activity in our life is thinking back to Genesis. And I'm curious if it is like, a good or true archetype or type to think of the cherubim that God appoints to protect the Garden of Eden after Adam and Eve get kicked out with the flaming sword to make sure that they don't have access to the Tree of Wisdom and the Tree of Life anymore. I'm curious if the guardian angels have the same sort of activity or if this is, like. Does this work as, like, a type in terms of, like, archetypes to make that comparison?"}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #103 - 2024-10-25 - Fiend Folio","start":4021.59,"end":4119.33,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Yeah, I mean, interestingly, like, that cherub that's placed with the flaming sword, I think the exact language is, this is a. Guards the way to the Tree of Life. But really, what. But what's. What's happening, what that means is that the cherub is actually guarding Adam and Eve from killing themselves, you know, spiritually from. From being crystallized in evil. Right. So they don't have access to immortality is the idea. Yeah, I mean, I think, you know, like, it's. It's tempting to want to taxonomize angelic beings, and of course there's a. There's some precedent for that. Of course, you know, like the ranks of angels and so forth. But, but yeah, I think the function that you're talking about, the guarding, the guiding, you know, the, the taking care of. Right. That is what a guardian angel does. And that's what we, in our prayers to them that exist in our tradition, that's what we ask them to do. We ask them to help us. Help. Help us be kept from sin, you know, to protect us from temptation, to guard us from demonic attack, all that kind of stuff. So, so yeah, that, that kind of guarding function that you see, not just with the angel at the door of paradise, but many cases, like, you know, the Archangel Raphael functions as a guardian angel in the book of Tobit, for instance. You know, there's a lot of that stuff in the history of the church. What do you think, Father? Is there, is there a linkage between all these concepts?"}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #103 - 2024-10-25 - Fiend Folio","start":4120.53,"end":4196.55,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"I think St. Raphael is a good example because, yeah, I think we get hung up on the guarding element, and it's really more that concept, when you go to its roots in Second Temple Judaism and early Christianity, is much closer to a guiding angel. Right. You can see how St. Raphael kind of guides, accompanies and guides Tobit on his journey. I mean, there are instances where he guards him from something or helps him guard himself, but overall, it's more of this guiding idea. Yeah, right. And guiding and shaping. Now, when you contrast it with what we were talking about in the first half, Right. So a demonic spirit is going to try to guide people to destruction. Right. Whereas an angelic being is going to try to guide someone back toward God, guide them to Christ, guide them to. Back to God. And so part of the purpose of, like, the prayer to the guardian angel is to try to help attune ourselves to that guidance."}

Yeah, perfect. Yeah. Thank you. That was kind of the source of my questioning because I know there's also, like, in my morning prayers, at least it. When I, in the prayer to my guardian angel, it mentions something along the lines of, like, protect me against, like, the demons and help make sure that they don't subdue my mortal body. And like, almost Seeming like it's talking about possession in the sense that you're talking about in the first half."}

Like a guardian angel can't go against your. Well, won't generally go against your will. Like, if you're like, I'm going to sin, you know, what can it. What can he do? Right. So, like, if, you know, and I'm going to sin means I'm going to cooperate with demons. That's what that means. So the guiding function and the guarding function in a lot of ways are kind of the same thing."}

There's like sort of the frank, pretty version that the attacks of the demons is like they're swinging an invisible flaming sword at you and like your guardian angel parries it with his sword or something. Right. This is going on and you can't see it. The way that demons attack us is by tempting us to sin."}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #103 - 2024-10-25 - Fiend Folio","start":4397.59,"end":4479.26,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"So we're not talking about like the gods of the nations. Right, right. In the sense that we've talked about them, like with the Tower of Babel. Right. What we're talking about are the bodiless, unclean spirits that come and possess people, that torment people. Right. That are especially prominent in the Synoptic Gospels. And I say the Synoptic Gospels because there are no exorcisms in St. John's Gospel, but in St. Matthew, St. Mark and St. Luke's Gospels, there are lots of exorcisms. And you find these kind of spirits in the same sense that you find in the Synoptic Gospels, for example, in Tobit that we just mentioned with the collar. So the Second Temple period, very clearly there. But you don't find that particular kind of phenomenon described that much. Well, not really at all. In the Torah, for example. Right. And the places where you start seeing references to like, unclean spirits are, for example, in first through fourth kingdoms, first and second Samuel, first and second Kings. But that's one continuous story that ends in the exile. So that's. This is the text that's written relatively during the exile. Right?"}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #103 - 2024-10-25 - Fiend Folio","start":4479.26,"end":4486.78,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Yeah. Like, like Saul, for instance, when the Holy Spirit departs from him, he then gets attacked by this, this demon, unclean spirit."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #103 - 2024-10-25 - Fiend Folio","start":4486.78,"end":4523.74,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Yeah. And so you see that showing. But again, this is in the exilic period. Right. So this is a phenomenon that primarily gets described in the context of Second Temple Judaism in terms of texts that we have. Right. I am certain there was an understanding. So if you're asking. Right. Well, if we say that that's true and that happened to Saul while saul is around 1000 BC right. The ancient Israelite religion had some understanding of this and where they came from. And I'll say I agree with you. The problem is it's hard to know."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #103 - 2024-10-25 - Fiend Folio","start":4525.42,"end":4525.98,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Yeah."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #103 - 2024-10-25 - Fiend Folio","start":4526.22,"end":4596.91,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Because we don't have any extra Biblical texts from 1000 BC Jewish Extra Biblical text or Israelite extra biblical text, unless you count like two and three line inscriptions. And even then, a lot of those are biblical names or related to biblical events. Right. So they're only barely extra biblical and they're tiny inscriptions and things. Right. We're not talking about a text talking about the origin of demons, but we do have those kind of texts once we get to the Second Temple period. So we at least know at that point what was being thought as we move toward the New Testament. And then we could sort of trace that out from the Second Temple period into the New Testament into the early Church and the Fathers. Right. So that's where we're going here in this second half. Now, of course, we've talked a bunch on the show, and so we're not going to belabor it again about the way this is presented in the Book of Enoch in Jubilees. And yes, I say Enoch. I know he's a Sleestack. I don't care."}

But the Book of Enoch and Jubilees, Right, We've talked about that. Right. That these are the spirits of the Nephilim who are killed in the flood. Right? Now remember, the Nephilim are semi divine. The Nephilim are the heroes of old, the men of renown. Right. These are. So what we find here, as we've talked about before, is not a rejection of the pagan stories. Right."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #103 - 2024-10-25 - Fiend Folio","start":4628.2,"end":4631,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"It's a different interpretation of what's really going on."}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #103 - 2024-10-25 - Fiend Folio","start":4664.81,"end":4748.15,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"So. And we've talked about the. The story about Mastema in Jubilees where Mastema is one of the leaders of those now disembodied dead Nephilim who they're gonna get thrown into the abyss along with their fallen angel parents. And Mastema goes and begs on their behalf to God to allow them to stay sort of at large, wandering around, roaming the world. Again, you see the parallels. But they promise that they'll just afflict wicked people. Right. And God, of course, allows their request. He lets 10% of them stick around on Earth because God's plan is to use them afflicting the wicked to bring the wicked to repentance. God wants to use them to help bring those people to salvation and bring good out of their evil, sort of against their desires. And this plays out in various levels of detail in different parts of the Dead Sea Scrolls. Dead Sea Scrolls, of course, are from an Anakin community at Qumran. So you have all kinds of taxonomy about Belial and the demonic spirits, and it's all very consistent with that kind of idea."}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #103 - 2024-10-25 - Fiend Folio","start":4752.63,"end":4801.53,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"But one important thing to emphasize here in the Second Temple period is it's not just Enoch Judaism that has this view. Right. And this is important as we're going to now move into the New Testament and move into the early Church fathers, because Christianity is not just a Second Temple Judaism. It is specifically a form of Second Temple Phariseeism, as we've said. So we have a nice quote from Josephus, a Pharisee, in his antiquities, about where he believes these unclean spirits come from."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #103 - 2024-10-25 - Fiend Folio","start":4802.09,"end":4885.52,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Yeah. Okay. So this is Josephus in Antiquities 3, 1. He writes this. Now this posterity of Seth continued to esteem God as the Lord of the universe and to have an entire regard to virtue for seven generations. But in process of time they were perverted and forsook the practices of their forefathers, and did neither pay those honors to God which were appointed them, nor had they any concern to do justice towards men. But for what degree of zeal they had formerly shown for virtue, they now showed by their actions a double degree of wickedness, whereby they made God to be their enemy. For many angels of God accompanied with women and begat sons that proved unjust and despisers of all that was good on account of the confidence they had in their own strength. For the tradition is that these men did what resembled the acts of those whom the Greeks called giants. But Noah was very uneasy at what they did, and being displeased at their conduct, persuaded them to change their dispositions and their acts for the better. But seeing they did not yield to him, but were slaves to their wicked pleasures, he was afraid they would kill him together with his wife and children and those they had married. So he departed out of that land. So it's interesting. I mean, he basically says that there's this some kind of union between angels and humans. And you get giants and connects it."}

Everyone, by the way, the angels transgressed this appointment and were captivated by love of women and begat children, who are those that are called demons. And besides, they afterwards subdued the human race to themselves, partly by magical writings and partly by fears and the punishments they occasioned, and partly by teaching them to offer sacrifices and incense and libations, of which things they stood in need after they were enslaved by lustful passions. And among men they sowed murders, wars, adulteries, intemperate deeds, and all wickedness. Whence also the poets and mythologists, not knowing that it was the angels and those demons who had been begotten by them that did these things to men and women and cities and nations which they related, ascribed them to Zeus himself and to those who are accounted to be his very offspring, and to the offspring of those who were called his brothers, Poseidon and Hades, and to the children again, of these offspring. For whatever name each of the angels had given to himself and his children by that name, they called them. So this is St. Justin, like, correcting the Greeks, correcting, you know, Greek mythology and saying, no, no, no, it wasn't Zeus and Poseidon and Hades. This was the watchers coming down."}

And Athenagoras, by the way, is also second century, so very, very early on then you've got Commodianus in his instructions, chapter three. When Almighty God, to beautify the nature of the world, willed that the sun that. Excuse me, willed that the earth should be visited by angels when they were sent down. They despised his laws. Such was the beauty of women that it turned them aside so that, being contaminated, they could not return to heaven. Rebels from God, they uttered words against him, then the highest uttered his judgment against them. And from their seed, giants are said to have been born by them. Arts were made known in the earth and they taught the dyeing of wool and everything which is done. And to them when they died, men erected images. But the Almighty, because they were of an evil seed, did not approve that when dead they should be brought back from death, whence wandering they now subvert many bodies.

He says here, before I go on, I want to remove a wrong impression from your minds. So he's going to do a little debunking. For it is a fact that many of the less instructed think that the souls of those who die a violent death become wandering spirits. But this is not so. I repeat, it is not so. It isn't the souls of those who die a violent death that become demons, but rather the souls of those who live in sin. Not that their nature has changed, but that in their desires they imitate the evil nature of demons. Showing this very thing to the Jews, Christ said, you are of your father the devil. He said that they were the children of the devil, not because they were changed into a nature like his, but because they did the kinds of things he did. For the same reason, he adds, and your will is to do your father's desires. Also John says, you brood of vipers who warned you to flee from the wrath to come, bear fruit that befits repentance. And do not presume to say to yourselves, we have Abraham as our father. The scripture, therefore, usually bases the laws of relationship not on natural origin, but on good or evil disposition. And if anyone acts like or does the same things as a certain group, the scripture declares him to be their son or their brother."}

But the fact that there's this transition in the 5th century in terms of the fathers holding to like the quotes we've been reading, holding to this kind of second Temple Jewish and then early Christian consensus about the. Not just the origin of demons, but who the Nephilim were, some version of the Watcher's story, etc. To adopting the rabbinic Jewish view regarding the sons of Seth and the daughters of Cain. Right. And we talked about the reasons for that transition. That sort of paganism, the kind of pagan ritual life that explained what that was referring to had gone away. So they didn't see it. We talked about how like St. John Cassian, St. John Chrysostom, in his second set of homilies on Genesis, it's not clear what his view is in the first set. In the second set of homilies on Genesis, he makes arguments about why he holds the Sethite view and not the other view. But he talked about how important it is. And St. Augustine makes arguments. How important it is that they make arguments."}

So, I mean, there's a lot going on here that I think is worth. Worth teasing out some bits. Number one. Number one, God created all that is and created all that is to be obedient to Him. And so entities with free will are either being obedient to him or they're not. Right. So you're. They're doing what God made you to do, or you're not doing what God made you to do. So the idea of neutrality does not make any sense because it sort of suggests like, well, I can kind of do my own thing and not the thing that the one who created me told me to do. Right. If God is not the Creator of all, then, yes, their idea of neutrality makes sense. So neutral spirits in the truest theological sense can only exist in a pagan conception of the universe where there is not an almighty God who created all things and therefore has claim over all things. Right. So that's kind of the theology that I think we need to. You know, when we're asking this question, we needed to note that. But is it the case that within these traditions, these stories, these legends, that there are spirits that are kind of somewhere. Somewhere in between, that aren't really on one side or the other or whatever? Yes, I mean, that does exist in these stories. Right. And the question then is not whether these things are depicting actual spiritual realities, but rather what is their function within the story. Right. So like Puck in Midsummer Night's Dream, his task, he doesn't actually have that much in the way of agency. He does what Oberon tells him to do. You know, his task is to push the plot along by. By his use of drugs. And, you know, that that's his. That's his job. Right. He does that. And then there are other. Lots of other kinds of legends and stories that have these. These spirits. Like, another way, if you're trying to, like, if you want to try to kind of shoehorn the. This stuff in so that it. Maybe it's somehow kind of sort of works. You could say, well, maybe these are, like elemental spirits that. That are part of the angelic beings that God created to help govern the universe. And the fact that they're, like, taking care of plants and stuff is not an obvious allegiance to God within the scope of that story. Okay, maybe I can kind of sort of buy that, because a lot of people don't realize, like, doing things like taking care of plants and taking out the garbage are actually obedience to God, because they are. But again, like, that kind of posits a universe in which God is not actually everywhere present and filling all things and the creator of all things, you know, kind of. So, yeah, I mean, I agree that these beings exist in these stories and that they say, and there's important things being said by their existence in the stories and the way that they function in the stories. Right. But then to try to map that onto our actual demonology and angelology, I don't think it works. I don't think it works because then again, it requires a different model of who God is and where everything came from. I don't know, Father, you want to weigh in on this whole neutral spirit thing."}

And we want to say New Age nonsense and say it's all silly, but no, we're playing with some dangerous stuff. And my, My former mentor, you know, she talked about genius all the time, where her practice was to help you discover and activate your genius, your, Your spiritual gift, like this hidden inner spiritual self that you can activate through like meditation and specific kind of practices. And, And I also think, I wonder if this is also linked to things like. And that you hear other New age mentors say that sounds like fluff, like a higher self and inner being and all that where just like meditate and everything and you do these practices and help you manifest. But, but yeah, so you're supposed to do all these things. But like, what you guys were saying about it being a, you know, being that you need to like, do sacrifices to and appease. Like, we had certain little things like, you know, it's just like, oh, you have to treat yourself like royalty because this is quote unquote, an imperial frequency that you're basically like, you're courting it and you're trying to like. I mean, basically you're making yourself into a narcissist so that you can get a spiritual gift. And it kind of works. Except for, except for I do believe that God protected me and called me back. But yeah, like. And also like, yeah, if you don't obey it, it will reject you. And it can do anything from just not giving you the, the, the spiritual insights or now the. It's funny how the modern, you know, language and everything is. Now, they're usually called downloads. Like, oh, I got the latest download and you say some. Something, you know, and everyone thinks it's genius. And, and so you, but you get, you know, I've seen women. Oh, and it is women. It's mostly women in these groups.

You guys are talking about this sacrifice thing, I was like, oh, no, I'm not supposed to get myself this treat. Maybe I need to just do aesthetic. But I. And that makes me really value orthodoxy because everything in that. In those practices were saying, like, you have to spoil yourself, treat yourself, indulge yourself, seek out new and exciting experiences, try new things that scare you, do all these things.

And those are the masculine form of that is the idlu, Lili. And then the Ardat Lily is the feminine form. Idlu means young man, Ardat means young woman. So Lili is the same. It's one of those spirits. It's a little Lilith, basically, or a lesser Lilith or Lilu, but then either the young man version or the young woman version. And obviously, as we just mentioned with Gilgamesh, the connection there to what's going on in the Nephilim story should probably be pretty obvious. Right.

Nevertheless, it is the testimony of Scripture, which tells us nothing but the truth, that angels appeared to men in bodies of such a kind that they could not only be seen, but also touched. Besides this, it is widely reported that Silvani and Pans, that is to say, satyrs and fawns, commonly called incubi, have often behaved improperly toward women, lusting after them and achieving intercourse with them. These reports are confirmed by many people, either from their own experience or from the accounts of the experience of others, whose reliability there is no occasion to doubt. Then there is the story that certain demons, whom the Gauls call dusii, constantly and successfully attempt this indecency. This is asserted by so many witnesses of such a character that it would seem an impertinence to deny it. Hence, I would not venture a conclusive statement on the question whether some spirits with bodies of air, an element which even when set in motion by a fan is felt by the bodily sense of touch, can also experience this lust and can so mate in whatever way they can with women who feel their embraces. So. But I'm gonna just, you know, as I'm ruining Narnia. This was one of. This is one of Tolkien's objections to the early parts of the lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. Because he's like, look, you can't have a faun show up and hang around a little girl that's indecent. Because we all know what fauns do in the stories, and that's what he's referring to. Is this so. Yes. I'm sorry. It does kind of ruin Narnia for everybody at two."}

So this is not my final thought, but I just want to say something about this deeply weird, weird, weird moment is we're not pulling this stuff out to just say, look at these freaky Things some of the Church Fathers say, but rather the point is they are reading the Scriptures, right? They're reading, particularly in Genesis, but also looking at other stuff. They're looking at their world. And we heard Augustine, for instance, talking about all kinds of stuff he's heard from people that he, that he regards as reliable, credible people, right? No reason to disbelieve them, he says. And they're taking all this stuff very seriously and trying to make sense of it because for them, there's no, like, word in Scripture that shouldn't be made sense of. You know, they're. They're really trying to confront it and make some sense of it. And obviously they're saying there's some things that, there's theories that they're coming up with that just are just way the heck out there. And the reason why they seem so weird and kind of bizarre, very bizarre, truly bizarre to us is because at least, especially in terms of these kinds of mechanistic theories about like, demons transporting human gametes. Like, the Church has basically left that stuff behind because it, it said, you know, we don't really need to go into that. You know, the point is that humans can be deeply involved with demons and including with sexual sin. Like, this is truly a thing and it is demonic. Sexual sin is demonic. You know, that's, that's like the landing point of all of this. It's not just to be interested in weird, fake, freaky stuff in, you know, seldom read corners of some of the Church Fathers. It's. It's that they're taking all these things seriously and we need to as well."}

There being the point. Because the kind of phenomena we're talking about in the pagan world, in the world of pagan ritual, still goes on."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #103 - 2024-10-25 - Fiend Folio","start":9237.49,"end":9672.87,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Yeah. Because it's about humans interacting sinfully with. With demonic beings in one way or another. Yeah. So here at the end of. I'm going to go ahead and say this is in fact, the weirdest Lord of Spirits episode so far. What are we to make of all of this? This isn't just, you know, trotting out a bunch of deeply weird stuff, although it is definitely trotting out some deeply weird stuff. But I think that one of the big takeaways from this is that the Christian understanding of the human person and of the world in general, but particularly the human person, is that he is permeable. He's permeable to the spiritual world. Right. I mean, most of us, you know, the way that we're sort of trained by our culture is to think that we are a, you know, a spirit inside some kind of biological shell. And, you know, we sort of drive it around like. Like mechs in 1980s anime. And so, you know, the idea that. That spiritual beings are influencing us all the time doesn't, you know, doesn't make a lot of sense. It's not how we think we're experiencing the world. But that's not the Christian teaching about human person. The human person is understood to be permeable, Right. Not just by thoughts, as we've talked about, with what the noose is being, a sort of sensory organ that receives thoughts, but also by spirits. Like spirits are influencing us. Right. And in fact, the word spirit, as we've said in the. The episode we did, what's the spirit, when it's at home explicitly, is about when some other entity is asserting an influence on us and guiding and animating and. And so forth. We've talked a lot about in this episode about the sinful side of that. Right. But we didn't spend a lot of time on. And maybe in the future we will spend some more time on this. The side of that. That and we have spent some time on in other episodes, for sure. But the side of that, that's not the sinful side, which is that we have guardian angels who function as guiding spirits. They assert an influence on us, but it's not a controlling influence in the sense of, like, they make us do things. Right. And the Holy Spirit, same thing. Not a controlling influence in the sense of making Us do things, but rather that it is about guidance, about relationship, about love, and therefore also about freedom. You know, as, as Rachel, our caller from Ohio, said, you know, people interact with, with some of these dark spirits. They, it seems great at first, but then eventually it turns dark. And that's because it's not about love. Love always acts in freedom and acts for the other person's freedom. Whereas when you yoke yourself to a dark spirit, you are being enslaved, you are being addicted, you are being controlled. The good news is there is a path out of that. There is a path out of that. And we, we heard, you know, I saw some of those comments in YouTube, I saw you people saying some of this. And of course, as I said, we heard from, from Rachel as well. There is a path out, right? And we also heard about the exorcisms that are done as part of baptism in the Christian church. There's a path out. You don't have to be addicted. I know that it is seductive. I know that it promises all kinds of lovely things, things that seem lovely, promises pleasure, promises warmth, promises, you know, intelligence, promises strength, whatever, right? These are all the things that these, the pagan gods and these, these lesser spiritual beings always have whispered in the, the ears of humanity for thousands of years. Just sacrifice to me, just devote yourself to me, and I'll give you all this stuff. But it chains you down, it controls you, it addicts you, distorts you, it deforms you, darkens everything. Christ gives freedom from all of that. Christ gives freedom. And not only does he say, I'm going to let you free, I'm going to set you free from all that, but also I'm going to exalt you to be equal to the angels. I'm going to exalt you to become like myself. I'm going to exalt you so that you are on that infinite path of theosis, of becoming more and more like God. That's what Christianity is about. That's what it's about. And so, you know, the reason why on this podcast we explore the dark side of a lot of these things is because I think because in our modern world, in the modern, at least in modern America, I know we have a lot of listeners from other countries as well. So, you know, your mileage may vary, as we like to say. There's so much that we've set up to make ourselves comfortable, right? That the fact that we are enslaved to our passions, we are so kind of anesthetized that we may not even realize that that is the case. And so I think that trying to understand some of this dark stuff, not in a way because we're fascinated by it and want to focus on it or whatever, that's not the point at all. If you think that's the point, then you're not. You're not. You're not listening. It's rather to give us a clear view of where we are spiritually and that each person should look at his own soul and ask, okay, okay, what am I addicted to? What spirit have I handed myself over to? And how can I repent? How can I receive that, rescue that release, that freedom from Christ? How can I advance in holiness? And how can I listen to my guardian angel? How can I listen to the Holy Spirit and be led on that path rather than on the very, very dark one? Father Stephen."}

And, you know, I don't know, in our listener base, I like to think more people will indulge in a little bit of horror movie action or something for Halloween and have some fun with it. But, you know, when we're kids, we're scared of the monster in the closet or under the bed. When I was a little kid, there was actually this weird old 70s curtain. It was like olive colored, and there was this. It had a weird pattern on it. And there was this one spot where it kind of looked like a kind of sinister face that I would sit there and stare at at night when I was trying to go to sleep to make sure it didn't move. Then we grow up, you know, we think there's these monsters lurking and demons lurking and creatures lurking. And in our materialist world, the way we get past that is we tell ourselves, well, that's not real. Look, silly. Look under the bed. There's dust bunnies. You should clean that. There's no monsters, right? There's nothing in the closet but old junk. Right. That's just a dumb pattern in the drapes, right? We'll replace the drapes. They're old anyway, Right? And unfortunately, that's not the truth. The truth is there are monsters and demons out there in the world. The world isn't safe, spiritually or physically."}

And really, there's nothing to be afraid of. The problem is that we're responding with fear, right? It's not often on this show or anywhere else where I'll hold up Origin as an example. Right. But honestly, in that one little bit of contra Kelsis, where origin is just saying, you know, oh, really? Demon attacks. Sucks to be you."}

The idea that we don't respond by fear, we respond by fighting back because we know that ultimately the battle has already been won by Christ. And so that we not only have a protection, again defense, this defensive talk, you don't have to be afraid because you're protected. No, no, no, no, no, no. We have authority. We're on offense."}

There aren't good guys and bad guys out there in the world. I have read more comics than any of you. I guarantee it. That's not the real world. There's not good guys and bad guys. There's just a bunch of guys. Every person, the most evil, wicked person you will meet, a giant, if he's still alive, is a person who God loves, is a person who Christ loves so much he was willing to die for them no matter what they've done, no matter how horrific it is. So when we go on the offensive, we're not going on the offensive against that person. We're not going on the offensive against the people who have wronged us. We're not going on the offensive against the bad people to politically take our country back from the bad people."}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #103 - 2024-10-25 - Fiend Folio","start":9972.12,"end":10071.83,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"To try to force people out of our church who we've decided are bad people, or out of our community or cut off people in our family who we've decided are bad people. We're going on the offensive against the spirits that have led those people who God loves to do bad things, evil things, sometimes horrible things, to themselves and to other people. That's the enemy. We're going on the offensive against. That quote, unquote, evil person is the prize that we're fighting over. That's the person we're trying to win. That's the person who needs the salvation and the transformation that we're finding in our own life as evil people. So I think it's important, right? It's important this Halloween to remember that there are real monsters, and while they can be scary, we shouldn't fear them. If those monsters are spiritual, we need to face them boldly and without fear because we've already won. We're the boss of them. And if they're human monsters, then we need to face them with the love and the compassion and the forgiveness."}
