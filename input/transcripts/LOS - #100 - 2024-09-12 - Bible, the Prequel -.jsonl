And he will be the light of the nations and the hope of those whose hearts are troubled. All who dwell on the earth will fall down and worship him. And they will praise and bless and celebrate with song the lord of spirits. First Enoch, chapter 48, verses 4 through 5. The modern world doesn't acknowledge, but is nevertheless haunted by spirits and angels, demons and saints. In our time, many yearn to break free of the prison of a flat secular materialism, to see and to know reality as it truly is. What is this spiritual reality like? How do we engage with it? Well, how do we permeate everyday life with spiritual presence? Orthodox Christian priests Father Andrew Stephen Damick and Fr. Stephen DeYoung host this live call in show focused on enchantment in creation, the union of the seen and unseen as made by God and experienced by mankind throughout history. Welcome to the Lord of Spirits."}

Well, in the long ago times, there was something called the Stone Age, and this is generally divided into the Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic periods, which just means old, middle, and new people. It is this last period from which archaeology tells us something about ancient religion. But what does this have to do with Christianity? And how should we understand the continuity of religion from that most ancient of detectable prehistory to the orthodox Christianity of our own day? And we should probably start with asking what religion is, though. So I'm assuming everybody agrees on what religion is."}

Yes. As. As Father Andrew alluded, we're going to start by talking about what religion is anyway. Right. Because you say the term religion and everybody kind of thinks they know what that means. But if you press people about what that means, often people can't tell you exactly what that means in the sense of trying to give a definition, trying to say, okay, this is what religion is."}

So that's actually a lot trickier. Right. Than it sounds. And even the people who talk about religion the most, and by that I mean atheists on the Internet can't come up with a good definition of what religion is. And therefore we could safely say those folks don't know what they're talking about. But a lot of these arguments, you'll hear these sort of broad statements from the fedora gang saying things like, you know, well, religion is responsible for all the war, hate, bad things, expired lunch meat in the world. Right. Like, it's just religion. If we just get rid of religion. Right. Then we'd live in this beautiful utopia. Right. Of wonder."}

Whatever that, you know, sort of is, you know, and if you ever tried to argue with those people, which I did in the early days of the Internet when the system of tubes had just been connected before I realized it was pointless. You would get these interesting things, you know, because they would say things like, well, non religious people never go and murder religious people for being religious. And you'd bring up, say, you know, Stalin, Mao, Pol Pot. Right, Lenin. You know, I would get two responses. One, I literally had an atheist once tell me that Lenin's League of the Militant Godless was not a militant atheist organization. Which was fascinating. Right."}

So any bad ideology that they don't like, even if it was just as atheistic as them, they would try and say, well, that ideology is a religion or is religion so basically everything except science as they understand it. And of course, you know, they've taken like three science classes at high school, so. But yeah, so even there they would get used in a slippery way in the other direction. Right.

So we can sort of chart out and see, you know, how they're similar. This also, and relatedly, this is where you start getting the sort of taxonomies of religion, and the taxonomies of religion kind of take two forms. One form is, well, okay, we're gonna.

And all the religions that we're gonna say, for the sake of argument, only have one God, we're gonna put the monotheism category, like, what do you do with the Hurrah Mazda? What do you do? Anyway, and then all these other pagan religions where they talk about lots of gods, we're going to put those over the polytheism category, and you start getting these groupings like, oh, the Abrahamic religions that somehow involve Abraham.

There's nothing to be derived from it. Right? So here's what we're proposing tonight, right. As sort of a working and workable definition of religion. That religion is a way of being in the world that encompasses all levels of reality and expresses itself in practices."}

The first one is talking about a way of being in the world, right? Because. And the reason it's framed that way is that we want to get away from the idea of thought or ideas or beliefs, right. That could be included in a way of being in the world."}

So a way of being in the world can include, right. Who, who you think God is, a relationship you believe you have with him, right. It could include all these things, right. Every belief that any form of Christian or Jewish person or Muslim would events and say this is, this is a key part of our religion is believing this, right. That is encompassed in that idea of a way of being in the world. But this also encompasses your peasant farmer who doesn't care about theology. Right? But who goes and participates in the festivals, goes and participates in the sacrifices, right? Has the what anybody would Call the quote unquote, religious elements of weddings, funerals, births, rites of initiation. Right. All of these things. Right, yeah. Has that in a non reflective or pre reflective way. Right. Because religion has to include that too. Yeah. Right. So that's why I use the. A way of being in the world. Not a way of thinking or a worldview, but a way of being in the world. Right. So the second piece is that it encompasses all levels of reality. And that sounds, I know, like a weird circumlocution. But if we start talking about the natural and the supernatural or the spiritual and the material."}

But the idea is that it encompasses. It encompasses all of reality as reality is conceived by those people. Right. So that encompasses everything real. Right. And this is to get away from the idea that religion is just this element that covers this one part of life. Right. Because it's not really how religion has functioned historically. Right."}

And then finally we have the. Expresses itself in practices. Right. And that is that there is some kind of. Not just things you do and things you don't do, but that those form a routine or a habit or a cycle or. Right. Repeated. Repeated practices. And we're using the term practices because this encompasses things like worship. Right. But also encompasses things like ethical considerations and political considerations in the classical sense. Right. Now, politics classically was just ethics at the level of community. Right. So the way a person should govern their own life was seen as being of a piece of. With the way a ruler should govern a city, for example. Right. Aristotle writes his ethics, then his politics. So we're using practices because it encompasses all that encompasses everything from fasting and dietary stuff to how and when you worship and who leads it and how you structure your family unit and how you write. All of these things are encompassed by this idea of practices. And practices are kind of inescapable."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #100 - 2024-09-12 - Bible, the Prequel -","start":3310.37,"end":3402.07,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Yeah. Like, I mean, and this is. And this, again, not to pick too much on our Protestant friends, but there is this idea amongst a lot of Protestants, certainly the kind that I was when I was growing up that had this idea that the practices you engage in, especially like for instance, how you worship is kind of optional. Right. Like they would certainly say you should worship, but the particular way in which you do it. Right. These specific practices of worship, that's kind of a matter of taste or preference, you know, so it's kind of switchoutable. Right. And one of the reasons that on the other side that you can kind of see this is go to the website of almost, frankly almost any Protestant church and you will find a statement of faith if they're going to have include something like this. Right. A statement of faith. And the statement of faith is a list of beliefs, but rarely is there like a list of practices because the beliefs are the core thing. And I remember even hearing a lot of people say, like one major religious practice obviously is music. Say, well, it doesn't matter exactly what kind of music you use as long as the lyrics are expressing the beliefs correctly. So again, it's this idea that practices are sort of variable and optional and all that kind of stuff. But again, historically that's not the case. And early Protestants, of course, would not have seen it that way either. Like, this is a more of a modern Protestant kind of idea."}

And part of it is this thing that's been sort of bred into a lot of our Protestant friends. Right. Like pretty much any Protestant I've ever known. In a low stakes conversation, in a low stakes friendly conversation, if you say, should somebody who becomes a Christian get baptized? They're going to say yes. And if you say if somebody, should somebody who becomes a Christian attend Sunday worship? They're going to say yes. You know, should somebody who's going to be Christian, should they not participate in sexual immorality? No, they should not. Right. Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. Right. But if anyone says that, even with the word should a little too forcefully. Right. Works righteousness, right. There's this blanching, there's this pulling back of, well, no, none of those things are required for salvation. None of those. None of those things, Right."}

Are you saying, right, that if someone, you know, comes and says they got saved on this date, but then they never go to church, they never get baptized and they're a Fornicator and a murderer. That they're gonna, that they're gonna go to heaven because they got saved on that date and it doesn't matter. Yeah. And they're gonna say, well, no. Right.

And exhibit A, they, I don't know, folks know on YouTube, the good folks at Ancient Faith took a clip from our last episode and of some things I said to that to the effect of what I just said. And the comment section is kind of amazing. Right. In the knee jerk reactions. And I say knee jerk reaction because in some cases it's very clear that there was not any intent to try to figure out what I was actually saying. There was just a reaction, like a visceral reaction to this. Sounds like a false gospel of works righteousness, because beware. Right? But again, it practices, right? Every Protestant I know goes to church at least most Sundays and thinks that does it because they think they should. They go get baptized whenever their church offers communion, they participate in it. You know, they refrain from gross sin as best they can. When they do sin, they ask for forgiveness. Right? Like, I don't know any Protestants who don't do that. I don't know any Protestants who are like, you know, I'm going to do zero good works between getting saved and dying. Right? Just to prove that the one who does not work and is reckoned as grace. Right. I don't know anyone like that. Right. I doubt you do either if you do get them help. So obviously Protestants aren't that way. And acting like Protestants are that way, like some Roman Catholic apologists do sometimes is just ridiculous and childish. Right, we get it. But you know, we need to stop. Be careful with the knee jerk reaction. Right? Because probably even when I said practices practices. Well, you got practice it. Yeah, you do, right? We all know you do. We all know you do. And you can frame it as well. That's part of sanctification, not justification. Whatever you need to do so that we can have the conversation. Okay, cool, But. Right, but there's practices involved. Right. There just are in religion. Right. This definition is also nice because we don't have to worry about this whole distinction between what is a religion or what is religion and what is philosophy."}

We've talked about this before on the show. That's absolute nonsense. Absolute nonsense. Now, we're going to talk a little more about that in the second half. They thought they had a more refined version of religion. Right. But they didn't think it was a separate religion. They didn't have a concept of a religion, but they didn't feel like they had absented themselves from the general civic and religious life of Athens, for example."}

And last sort of note, within practices, another reason why the term practices I think is good is that when we talk about practices, practices within the same sort of religious milieu can admit of variation based on time and place. Right. So a good example of that is dietary stuff. Right. Almost all religious expressions have some kind of dietary stuff. It may be stuff you're not allowed to eat ever. It may be fasting patterns. Right. But there's. There's something connected to eating. And of course that's going to be shaped a little in different parts of the world. Right.

And so the fact that there's a difference within that practice based on where you are does not necessarily mean, oh, now this is an entirely different religious expression. Right. Because they're forbidden to eat pork and they're in a place where there are no pigs anyway. Right. That's accidental. The fact that they're living in a place with no pigs is accidental or the fact that they're now offering rice cakes instead of wheat cakes is accidental. Right.

Because you have the scriptures being composed, edited, compiled. Right. And the forms. Right. The forms that pre existed, that the forms from ancient Israel and ancient Judah still exist. There's a second Temple there, The temple's functioning, sacrifices are being offered, the same feasts are being. All those things are still happening right from the Torah that were happening before the exile. Right. In terms of religious phenomena. But you also now have this shift in these new religious phenomena related to the text of the Hebrew Scriptures and related to the scholars of that text and the synagogue system as a means of, of gathering and religious observance. So that's a change, that's a shift. There's continuity. But there's also now this new layer, this new phenomenon that gets added. If you want to go over to Greece at the very beginning of this period, you have Homer and Hesiod writing.

If you want to go to India, Buddhism emerges in this period. If you want to go to Persia, Zoroastrianism emerges at this period. So there is something happening all over the world during this period. And that's why there was a need for anthropologists studying this period and studying ancient religion to say we need a term for this era, this. This period of time when these shifts are happening worldwide. Right. And when we look at those shifts, you may have already noticed, as we were giving examples, there are some through lines. Right. There. There are some. There are some similar particular phenomena that are going on in these different places. And so we could talk about some especially within paganism. Right. So Old Testament religion. Right. Ancient Israel's religion and Judaism is a little bit of a special case, but we'll come back to that because there are some through lines there, too. But everywhere else we're talking about forms of paganism. Right. And so there are some things we can see. So one of them is the depersonalization or the relativization of spirits and gods. Right. Within paganism. So, for example, Plato's forms. We've talked about this on the show before. Plato's forms are basically the Greek gods and goddesses stripped of all of the anthropomorphic personhood. Yeah, right. Which Plato read the Euthyphro. Right. Believes is unworthy to ascribe to them. Right. So instead of a God of justice who is a philanderer and goes around doing these things. Right. You have justice itself."}

Right. To connect with things that they think are divine. Right. They've just sort of depersonified them. Right. Made them less human in the sense of possessing human foibles. Right. But you can also see this similarly, frankly, in. In the move of Buddhism out of Hinduism. The way, again, most forms of Buddhism treat the idea of gods and spirits from within Hinduism. Right. Where it's not sort of like, well, we deny all those things exist any more than Plato did. But they become relativized. Right. They become principles. They can become kind of depersonified. They become tools or elements of a ladder that might be useful to someone spiritually at a certain level of their development. But there are sort of more refined forms that go beyond that. Right."}

And in the Northern Kingdom, of course, it's even worse because they're engaging in all kinds of pagan worship and stuff, right? There's not a Torah scroll to be found, right. For a normal person. Whereas right. Post exile, once you have the synagogue system, you do start having public Torah readings, right? Ezra does read the Torah publicly started having less writing and literary activity, right? So now your average Jewish person who's going to a synagogue is hearing the Torah. And so those commandments take on a new pertinence to them, right? So the Pharisees still believed that, that the solution to the problem, the ongoing problem of exile and Roman oppression was that Israel, right, at that time Judeah, had to corporately keep the Torah. But the way someone participated in corporately keeping Torah was by keeping Torah themselves, which Torah they now heard read at a synagogue. And so the Torah took on, in this period, an ethical dimension for Jewish people that it did not originally have. Right. A new dimension for Them. So these shifts, even though we're talking about different original religious structures, this shift does still take place. A parallel shift does still take place to produce what becomes Early Judaism, ancient Judaism, Second Temple Judaism, right. In all of its diverse forms. So what, what causes this? Right. Why does this happen all over the world at this, during this era in history? Right. There's a number of factors that play into it, right? So first and foremost, you have sort of the stabilization, a stabilization of society during this period. So remember, we're coming off the Bronze Age collapse at the end of the second millennium B.C. that kind of throws everything into chaos. And I've said, I know I've said before on this show, and I've said to lots of people, when you're envisioning the time period of David and Saul and even into Solomon, right at the beginning of the first millennium bc you've got to picture it in as sort of post apocalyptic. The people are living in and around the ruins of the great Bronze Age civilizations. And there are people trying to take up those mantles. Like the Assyrians will be trying to sort of, when they show up after a few centuries, will be trying to sort of take on the mantle of Babylon. And then they're followed by the Neo Babylonian Empire who are most certainly trying to lay claim to the empire of Hammurabi to which they're not related, and trying to rebuild that and reproduce that. The Philistines who you're running into are refugees from the Aegean who have come and settled in the Levant."}

We've now got the Greek city states functioning in Greece in the Classical period, right? After sort of the collapse of the Mycenaeans, Egypt has kind of recovered economically and financially.

First we get this stability, and then, as we've kind of already alluded to, you get an economic situation where you have the emergence of a very strong class system within these agrarian economies, right. Mostly based on slavery in various forms. But as we mentioned, they're. They're very conscious about the fact that, yes, for these upper tiers of society to enjoy a certain lifestyle and certain things, to have leisure time, to be able to have time to devote to these other things, there has to be this great pool of people who are meeting their survival needs in terms of food, shelter, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, tribute, taxes, right? All of this. All of this has to happen. And those structures come into place, right? Those structures come into place so that you can have a class of people, a literate class, right?

Right. Much more workable. Much more workable in terms of literacy. And so you get this rise of illiterate class. That means people start taking oral tradition stories, writing all these things that have been handed down orally, and putting them into writing.

And similarly, in other cultures, it's not just a storyteller telling their version of the story that's localized and related to particular traditions, but they start to take on this larger form. And so you get a sort of enlarged religious significance of the text. So this shift, the reason we've been talking about this shift, there's someone out there who's like, wait a second, I thought this episode was going to be about the Stone Age. And I warned you at the beginning we would not get there. To the third half, they say, why are you. Why are you dilly dallying in the middle of the first millennium B.C. well, so this, that we've been talking about the Axial Age, there's this Apocalypse shift we've been describing in. In religion across the world. And this one's really well documented because we've got all these texts from it. Right. So we could describe it, we could research it. You can look at it, you can look at it in various countries, spread out all over the world. You can compare and contrast. Right. It's all documented. This is not the first major shift like this, though. There was a previous shift in the Neolithic era in the Stone Age. Right. That one is not documented because there was no writing. It's prehistoric. Right. And so we've spent this time here in the second half talking about the Axial Age in this shift to give an idea of how this kind of thing works. Right. Since this one is so well documented, to help us understand now, as we in the third half go back even way further, we're going to go further back from the Axial Age than the Axial Age is from us to talk about what happened in the Neolithic revolution and what's going on there religiously."}

So we know about it from the remains of human Settlements and other archaeological remains and certain biological and genetic considerations. Not with humans, but with plants and animals. We'll get into that in a minute. So the Neolithic Revolution happens across the Fertile Crescent, which is that sort of green arch on that map that they showed you in seventh grade social studies that goes sort of over the top of the Middle East. Happened throughout that area between about 10,000 and 8,000 BC in different places at different times. I will give my usual disclaimer. If you don't think the Earth is that old, adjust accordingly. I find the whole question tedious and boring. So commonly dated to between 10,000 and 8,000 BC. And that's right after the end of the last Ice Age. Right. And again, feel free to think whatever you want about the relationship between that Ice Age and the Flood. That the evidence of that Ice Age is actually evidence of the flood.

Is that pre flood or pre, Pre Babel or, you know, were people writing things down? You know, I'm just wondering where does that start? Where, like, what is the difference? You know, did they, did they have the Neolithic period after the flood or after Babel or before? In regards, you know, just to writing."}

So there are some people who would say that all of the archeological, geological evidence of the last Ice Age is really evidence of the flood. So they would say that basically that the last Ice Age is the Flood."}

There are other folks who would say that the story, that the story of the flood is telling. Right. That sort of, when that happens is at the end of the last Ice Age. So at the end of the last Ice age, according to archaeology and geology, there were these massive earth changes, meaning The Ice Age is called the Ice Age because glaciers expanded over. Like for example, most of North America was covered by ice or water. Water in some form. Right. There is evidence during this period. Right. So that's why. So the people who say, well, that is the flood would say, well, that was liquid water, it was the flood. Right. But other people would say, well, no, that was glacier. But then at the end of that Ice age, those glaciers melted. And when those glaciers melted, they released the trapped water. So, for example, there's archeological evidence of a couple of cities at the bottom of the Black Sea. So there's pretty good evidence now that during the Ice Age there was no water in the Black Sea and that there were people living there. And at the end of the Ice Age, right, as the glaciers melted, it filled up with water and became the Black Sea. Right. So some people would say, well, no, the flood happens at the end of the last Ice age when the glaciers melt. Right. And it wipes out all of these human civilization as it had stood. Right. Using the Black Sea as an example, there are plenty of other examples beside the Black Sea. Right."}

But so the idea is the Neolithic period is the period right after the Ice Age. So if you connect the Ice Age to the flood, it would be the period after the flood. And so we would be talking about that. When we talk about the Neolithic revolution, we would be talking about, if that's your understanding, we would be talking about the period of time where the population grows to the level that we've been talking about and so starts to build cities and towns and. Right. Well, villages at this point. Starts to build villages. Right. And settle down in permanent places and begins. Begins more intentional agriculture."}

Right. And we've talked about this, we've read a couple of quotes. You can go back to old episodes, very early episodes, and here's some of the quotes about early quote, unquote, monotheism. We've already reiterated this episode why monotheism may not be the most helpful category to have in our head, but just the idea that early on in the hunter gatherer period, there is pretty good evidence that we're dealing with primarily one sort of deity or spirit that people understand to be associated in some way with the sky, with the heavens right above them."}

And we're going to start talking about particular settlements, the most ancient settlements we've found and that we know of. And what you find in those settlements is that the ritual elements, like megalithic stone structures that clearly have a religious purpose. Right. Those are there before the homes, the residences, the dwellings are. Right. And before the agricultural projects start. Right. So these sites are sites that are found and encountered by nomadic peoples. And then when the time comes for the nomadic peoples to settle down, they settle down at these sites. So they find a spring of water. There's a spirit that they associate with that spring of water. Right. They form a settlement there. The spirit they had associated with the spring of water now becomes one of the gods of that people. Right. They start to worship it. Right. And we talked about this in terms of what happens after Babel and the fact that there are angelic spirits. Right. Associated with these different things. Right. But the problem is humans are now starting to worship them as gods. Right. In and of themselves. So going to the earliest settlements we have, so one of the earliest sites we have that's become semi famous, though sometimes weird things are said about it is Gobekli Tepe."}

That the. The stones were put in place for the purpose of. And in some way, the ritual carvings are connected to constellations and things that would be at certain points during certain times of the year, getting into super detail. There are people trying to get into super detail on that in the sense of exactly where. What constellations were like in 9130 B.C. and stuff, and that. That period. But that is actually really hard to do, especially going back that far, because the Earth kind of wobbles in its orbit. So things shift slightly. The stars are not in the same place they were 5,000 years ago, right. Let alone 10 relative to any given position on Earth. So, but it's a general agreement that that's there. But again, those megalithic structures were there before anything else that has been found there, which suggests that. That these were built as this spiritual site, right? As this site of religious ritual and sacrifice to which nomadic peoples would come at a certain time of year. And then at a certain point, a certain later point after these structures were built, then we find other, like, domestic housing units, right. For lack of a better term, domiciles. We find evidence of human settlement there a little later, right? So then at a certain point, people start to settle there at the spiritual site permanently, rather than just migrate there at certain times of year for ritual purposes, religious purposes. And this is true of all of these earliest sites that we found that we're going to talk about now. The ritual site in every case is there first and exists as a place that people make what we would call a pilgrimage to. And then only later do people settle around it on a permanent basis. And this is something that not only happened during the Neolithic revolution, this has happened throughout human history with sacred sites where towns, villages, and things will grow up around certain sacred sites."}

And there was a rush by dabblers with some money, especially among the British, to get down there and say, now we can prove that the Bible is true. And being non gifted amateurs, they wrecked a few sites. Jericho is infamously one of them. They just started digging trenches and stuff in ancient Jericho. And so that's made it really hard. Just about anything you see about Jericho is super provisional. And for the record, if you see anyone saying anything definitive about the archaeological site of Jericho on either side, right. If you see someone saying definitively there's no way that Jericho was destroyed at the time of Joshua, whenever they think that was, be leery because the site's a mess, you can't prove that. But also if they say, oh no, for sure the city of Jericho was destroyed at the time of Joshua, whatever they think that was, they're also playing fast and loose. Right. The site's kind of a mess, so we can't learn as much from that as we might from some of these others that rain undiscovered. But the other one we're going to talk about a little more is Chettle Hoyk, which is from circa again 7100 BC. Again, adjust accordingly. So this one is a little further on by a little, I mean a couple thousand years then Gobekli Tepe, but is a more advanced site."}

So there's a dirt floor and the departed family members were buried in the, in the floor. Right. In the, in the family's domicile. And they were buried with some things. Right?

The other major element is that there are individual shrines inside these family homes. And these individual shrines take the form of bullheads and sets of bullhorns.

And then you get Kronos and the Titans, then you get Zeus, the storm God. And that's. He's kind of encapsulating some religious history there in his version of the succession myth, the double succession there. So we immediately find, you know, the bull of Heaven in the Epic of Gilgamesh, bull, baal. Right. All of this. Right. Bull symbolism gets carried on. So we know it goes back to this period. And then there's also sort of. That is the masculine. Then you find, for example, Gobekli, Tepe. Some of the animal forms are fish and sea creatures. You find the sort of sea serpent. So we've talked about Behemoth and Leviathan. Right. Behemoth and Lotan. Right. The sort of toxic masculinity and toxic Femininity of ancient paganism. But at this very early tier of pagan religion. Right. Leviathan Loten is sort of this symbol of order and power and strength and virility and Lothair Leviathan, the sea serpent. Chaos. Right. Destruction, disorder.

It is a negative religious development from the perspective of the true God. Right. Into the worship of many creatures essentially."}

What we're talking about when we say orthodox Christianity. Right. You want me to define orthodox Christianity? Orthodox Christianity is the right worship of the true God. And what that means in a certain sense is that anywhere in the history of the world and of humanity where the right worship of the true God has taken place, we could say that was orthodox Christianity. When we. On the Sunday of the triumph of Orthodoxy. I'd like to say we're not being triumphalistic, but it's called the Sunday of the Triumph of Orthodoxy. So we got to own it. When we say we read the Creed together, the nice, you know, Constantinopolitan creed, and we say this is the faith on which the world was founded. Right. We're not making the claim that 19th century German Lutherans made. We're not saying, finally, through the long scrabble of human history, we have arrived at orthodox Christianity of the type practiced in my parish in southern Louisiana in the 21st century, which is the pinnacle of all human religion. And all those benighted fools in the past didn't know what they were talking about and didn't know who God was. Right? We're making almost the exact opposite claim. We're claiming that what we're doing in the right worship of God and what Saint Nikephoros the confessor of Constantinople was doing in the early 9th century."}

In 6850 BC. But if there was anyone there, and probably not at Chital Hoyek because it was a pagan site, but if there was anyone who passed through there who, like Melchizedek or Jethro. Right. Had maintained the correct worship of the true God, then the God who that person came to know through sacrifice and prayer is the same God that we come to know through the liturgy, through the sacraments, through the scriptures. It's the same God. That God is the same three persons then is now. And so it is fundamentally the same religion. Not the pagans, but those who truly worship the true God throughout all the ages, it's all the same religion. And there are these transitions as texts are written and texts are recognized and texts take a place, the reading of text takes a place in worship. Right. But that doesn't mean it's a different God. And the fundamentals of worship, of sacrifice and of prayer and of the offering of incense haven't changed. Same God being truly worshiped by humans who are the same kind of humans. Just over time, as our way of our human way of life has shifted, there have been shifts to it as we've migrated, as we've multiplied, as we've gone different places and had different experiences."}

That's the God who it is who's the same yesterday, today, and forever. So that's both my. Why this episode and my final thoughts as I mess with the episode structure."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #100 - 2024-09-12 - Bible, the Prequel -","start":10143.2,"end":10585.64,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Yeah, I. I think, you know, just to extend a little bit what you just said, I think especially here in 2024, where a lot of us are trying to muddle our way around in a societal level, meaning crisis, one of the big temptations is to, like, super left brain at all, you know, give me the precise, exact, formulaic approach to X, Y and Z so I can get this right. And it's a. It's ironically, even though, like, we think of. We. We tend to think of this kind of thinking as sort of scientific, ironically, it's actually very magical kind of thinking. And if you look at what the scriptures say about what it means to worship the one true God, there are ultimately consistent, if you understand it correctly, but varying approaches to that over time. For instance, everything you see in Leviticus does not all carry forward into the new Covenant. Right. So there's clearly something different going on. But it is, as you just said, Father, it is consistent. It is the same religion. Even though the practices have a transformation and with this kind of absolutizing of formulae that gives a lot of us a sense of. I think it feels safe, you know, like, it's like, well, the world is nutty. And so, you know, give me. Give me the straight dope here so I can get this exactly right, because I want to get it right, because I'm tired of all the wrong. What you do is you end up absolutizing stuff that in some cases is not supposed to be absolutized or was appropriate for particular time and place and may not necessarily be appropriate for now. For instance, you know, God does not command us to offer up goats on altars now. Right. I don't think anyone seriously is doing that now. But I'm. Well, I'm sure somebody is actually, probably. But. But most people are not saying that's what we should do. But nonetheless, there can be this kind of. Again, this. This a formulaic approach to religion. And we absolutize things that can be variable, and we often variableize things or vary things that should actually be absolute. And the point. The point is to know and to worship the one true God, Father, Son and Holy Spirit, and not to worship these other gods. That's the point. And even though the exact shape that that takes over time can alter, the point is to orient ourselves towards him. Right. And this absolutizing impulse is frankly an impulse towards idolatry, and it's an idolatry of our concepts about God. Now, by saying that I am by no means nullifying the dogmatic inheritance of the church or anything like that, but sometimes people take the dogmas that speak about who God is and they worship them instead of God himself. Right. That's what I mean. And one of the ways that we could see we're falling into that, or at least having a temptation towards that is if we spend more time, frankly, and more energy on our concepts about God than we do on the actual practices of worshiping him and praying to him. Because a lot of people have been saved, a lot of people have been saved who were faithful to God but had very, maybe even incorrect or primitive concepts about Him. A lot of people have been saved that way because they were faithful and did the things that they were supposed to be doing. But a lot of people, frankly, are going to have some Answering to give in the life of the age to come, who spend a lot of time absolutizing particular pictures of God and not actually following his commandments. Right? And so, you know, one of our big themes for this, for this podcast for the last four years now and hundreds of hours now, has been if you love God, you will keep his commandments, as it says many, many times in the scriptures. And I think that looking at this kind of massive arc of human history and seeing how there is this variance over time, there is these changes over time underlines this, right? Because the whole point is to approach the one true God and to worship Him. That's the whole point. To have that fundamental orientation and to follow through and to do the things that you're supposed to do. Not just to say it, not just to honor him with your lips, as it says in Scripture, but actually to do it, to be faithful. If you love him, you keep his commandments. So this is just another angle from which to make that point and another and in this particular case, to make the point, as we have made many times, that there is this incredible consistency between Old and New Testaments. But even to say that there is this consistency within the arc of human history that forms the context of the Old and New Testaments, again, this doesn't mean that you can say or do whatever religiously and it's all fine. That is not the point that's being made at all, but rather that those who are truly worshiping the true God are truly worshiping the true God, even if the particulars of the way that they do that and the particulars of the way that they theologize about that show some development over time. So. Well, next time we're gonna, as I said, it'll be our hundredth episode, our fourth anniversary, so I hope you'll join us. But that is our show for tonight, so thank you for listening, everyone.
