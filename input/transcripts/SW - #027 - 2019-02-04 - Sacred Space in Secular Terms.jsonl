On this episode, I will be playing for you a talk that I gave at a conference in Seattle in 2017 with Jordan Peterson. It was called the Northwest Catholic Family education conference in October 2017. At that conference I gave two talks. One called Sacred art in secular terms and this one that I'm going to play for you now, which is called Sacred Space in secular terms. I won't be putting up the Sacred Arts talk because it was so image reliant, so you can find that on my YouTube channel. But I will play for you this one in which I look at the manner in which Sacred space sets up our perception of space, of identity, and especially of how we can come together as a community. And so enjoy."}

At the lowest point of the flood, it says, God remembered Noah. If you look at the story of Jonah, where down in the bottom of the well in his lowest point, it said, Jonah remembered God. That memory of God reaches down into the depths of death, to the depths of hell. And what's mostly important to understand when I'm talking to you about this is I want to help people to see that this is not a metaphor. When we go to church, when we stand together, when we look towards the altar together, when we sing in unison, you know, when we bow down before the altar, why do we bow down? We bow down to acknowledge this thing. We acknowledge what is the marker that unites us together. What is the source of our being? What is the source of. Of our existence. We make ourselves low to participate fully in that. And that's something you can't do as just a mental game if you've never physically laid your face to the ground."}

When we go to church, it's not a metaphor. We are participating in an actual unity by all the Things that we do, there's nothing that's arbitrary. Everything that we do is for us to participate fully in that movement, towards that invisible pillar, in that movement towards the cross, towards the tree, in the garden. All of that is happening physically, right? And to do it physically is to make your whole being part of that process. So that when you leave the church, so that when you move out, the memory of communion, the participation in communion follows you in the deepest way that you can imagine. And the memory of that communion becomes the thing that brings you through until you come back together, physically together in that space and recite things at the same time. You know, you have no idea what it does to people to recite things simultaneously, right? There's reasons why, like there's reasons why totalitarian regimes have people do that because they know that it binds people. But what does it mean when we can do that for the highest thing? We're not doing it just for an ideology. We're not doing it just for some political utopia, but we're doing it for the very source of who we are and the very source of everything. So I think that's what I wanted."}

As you know, this podcast is for now based mostly on my YouTube videos, which I am transferring into audio format. Please go ahead and visit my YouTube channel. There are more videos there on different subjects that I'm not going to put into audio. And please share this to your friends. I know a lot of people know about the YouTube content, but not so many people know that this is also a podcast. So share it to your friends. Share it on social media. And if you can, feel free to support this financially as well by going to my Patreon page, which is Pageau videos. Strangely, you can go there and you can support it at any amount that you want. A month for all the patrons. I do a monthly Q and A, a live Q and A in which people can ask questions in the chat. And I try to have a more personal connection with. With people. The YouTube comments have become difficult to follow and to answer. I'll see you soon."}
