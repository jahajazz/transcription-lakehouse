And he will be the light of the nations and the hope of those whose hearts are troubled. All who dwell on the earth will fall down and worship him. And they will praise and bless and celebrate with song the Lord of Spirits. The modern world doesn't acknowledge, but is nevertheless haunted by spirits and angels, demons and saints. In our time, many yearn to break free of the prison of a flat secular materialism, to see and to know reality as it truly is. What is this spiritual reality like? How do we engage with it? Well, how do we permeate everyday life with spiritual presence? Orthodox Christian priests, Father Andrew Stephen Damick and Fr. Stephen DeYoung host this live call in show focused on enchantment in creation, this union of the seen and unseen as made by God and experienced by mankind throughout history. Welcome to the Lord of Spirits."}

Why do the British like to say world without end at the end of their prayers? A lot of people have been wondering that. I bet.

So we're going to start with the whole concept of an age in scripture, because ultimately what the millennium is, is an age. And so before we can get to that particular age, we have to understand the concept of an age in general. And the most common way in which an age is referred to in the Hebrew Bible is with the term day yom. And so just connecting the idea of day and age, I know, has triggered a bunch of young earth creationists. But that's not where we're going, so relax."}

That's not where we're going with this at all. Right. But the word day, in addition to just referring to a day, Right. It does sometimes in the Hebrew Bible just refer to a 24 hour period or to the daylight hours, like day, night. Right. But there are also more specialized usages of it. So when you see day with the definite article, so hayom, or the day as it's usually translated in English, that is in most cases a reference to the day of the Lord, the day of Yahweh."}

And settles things and things are resolved. So this is true. By the way, though, we're not going to go too deep into this now. This is true Also in Genesis 3, there's that weird phrase that gets translated in all kinds of weird, contradictory ways in English is like the heat of the day, right. God, the heat of the day, or the wind of the day, or the cool of the afternoon, or it's translated all these. What it literally says there is Ruachayom, the spirit of the day. And God comes walking after Adam and Eve have transgressed, and he comes walking in the spirit of the day. So this is deliberately in the Hebrew, evoking the idea of judgment. Right. And that's what's happening. This is sort of an early intrusion. Right. Now, of course, the day of the Lord. The day of Yahweh. Right. The day is this pivotal transitional moment. Right? It is. When we're talking about the day of Yahweh in the Hebrew scriptures, we're talking about this transitional moment from one age to another. That's why it's relevant here. Because as we're understanding the concept of an age in scripture, we have to not only understand that there are these ages. Ages, but that there are these pivotal and decisive moments where things happen."}

And so it's associating them then with this particular character or characterization. Right. Connecting the age to that. There's also then the phrase in those days. And so you have in that day using the singular and then you have in those days, which is plural. And both of those are essentially the same kind of reference in that they're referring to a past or future age or era. But when it's singular, it's sort of referring to it as a unit. Whereas when it's plural in those days, it's referring to it in terms of extent over time."}

And like, like the way that I kind of worked it out was in terms. I mean, this is a rough analogy in terms of grammar. Like, so you've got the past perfect, you know, at that time, you know, in that period in those, you know, in. In that era, you know, versus sort of past imperfect. Like it used to be the case, you know, it was ongoing. Right. And I mean, even when we just use the. The singular definite article in English versus a plural one, it can make a big difference. Like, like we talk about the United States versus these United States. That's. That's a different concept, you know, and it's the sense of. In this case, it's plurality, you know, the states all together, whereas the United States is like a single unit. That's one country, you know."}

So this is in that day might be used to refer to something, like I said, the name of the city. And that day, Dan was called Laish. Right. It's just being used that period as a whole to locate when you're talking about the city had that name. Whereas when you get. In those days, the plural.

Is the idea that's being. That's being stressed there either in the past or in the future. So that's sort of the Hebrew use. And that's.

Right. And we talk about the end of the Bronze Age and the Bronze Age collapse. That was the collapse of a sort of world order that had developed during that period and then comes to an end. And when we talk about Late antiquity, it's late antiquity for a reason. The Western Roman Empire is close collapsing. Right. And there's a shift happening in the whole order of things. And this is really include in this idea of Aeon. It's a world order or state of things. And so this then in Latin translation, is where we get into the word seculum. And the word seculum really conveyed that same kind of idea of a world order. Right. Of a world structure. And St. Augustine really develops the way the word seculum is used, really innovates in terms of how that word is going to be understood going forward in the west in City of God. Because he, being, being the Platonist he was, uses the sort of Platonic schema of being and becoming and applies it to the City of God, the sort of age in which God eternally exists on the one hand, and then on the other hand, on the Earth, there is this constant sort of churning and turning of one seculum, one order, one world into another. And that's very much the point he's wanting to make in City of God. He's like, yes, those of you who think because the Western Roman Empire is collapsing that the world is ending. It sort of is, in a way. Right. In a sense, that world, that ordering of things that had prevailed until now for centuries is now dying and dead."}

It's the idea that it's a world without end versus these worlds upon worlds, you know, one world after another, that characterizes this world in the Augustinian conception."}

And that's going to have some consequences, Right. That are relevant to what we're talking about tonight. Because in that Platonic schema, right. This then sees God as being a very platonic fashion, unmoving, right, Pure act, separate. And then when humans leave this life in this world, we escape from this becoming, right? And this material world, enter into this sort of eternal now in which God dwells, this age in which God dwells. Right. And then this plays into the whole idea of the beatific vision. And then the problem becomes how. How you match that up with the bodily resurrection. And so that becomes a tension. I know I've commented on this on the show before. You see this tension all the way through the third part of Thomas Summa, which I know he didn't actually write himself. It was compiled from his notes. But then maybe he had a resolution to the tension. But there's still a tension there between the beatific vision and the bodily resurrection in the Western eschatology that develops. And it's really because of this platonic understanding of St. Augustine when it gets kind of followed out. Right. I don't see a lot of evidence that St. Augustine ever followed it out that far, but other people do, like Bnselm. But yeah. So then we have this idea of world without end. And a similar idea to that world without end is expressed in some of our orthodox liturgics when it talks about the day that has no end in some of our liturgics. And that day there's Is being used in this sense of age, Right. That there will ultimately be an age that has no end. And this is reflected in Revelation 21, when St. John says that in the new heavens and the new earth, there is no night. If there's no night, that means there's no end to the day, meaning it goes on forever. So certain folks who are of a certain bent, maybe primarily identified by three initials."}

We have this narrative and we tend to think of that in a very literal way. And so then we'll read some of the church fathers, like Saint Maximus who says that Adam fell as he came into being. And you're like, well, wait, what?"}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #070 - 2023-06-22 - Millennium - Bug or Feature -","start":2343.57,"end":2515.22,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Right, right. But what Saint Maximus is pointing to there, as other fathers do in different ways, like with the garments of skin that we've talked about before, the difference in the human body is saying this is a different order of things and that carries with it a different way in which time is experienced by humans. Right. So the fact that we have to describe something using words and syllables and that then recounting and reading aloud those words and syllables takes place over a period of time does not necessarily mean that what we're describing was experienced over a period of time in the same way. Right, right. And think about, I could, if I witnessed a car accident, right. I could write you a 1500 word, super detailed description of the moment of impact, right. It would still only be a moment of impact, even though it might take you 5 minutes to read what I wrote in the description. Right. And that would mean that I was lying to you about all this stuff couldn't happen in one moment. Right. This is, you know, so many minutes worth of material. Right. So that's an example. That's just an analogy, right? That's not exactly what we're talking about, but that's an analogy. Right. So then the expulsion from paradise is this transitional moment. When we talk about the expulsion from paradise, that's really what we're talking about. Or if we want to call it the Fall or one of the falls, right. We're talking about that transitional moment to now this new age, this new era, this new world comes into being, which is the world outside of paradise leading up to the flood, right. The days of Noah, right. What's recounted in the genealogies of Seth and Cain. So everything with the Nephilim, everything with Lamech and his wives and the spread of sin and all of those things happening, right. This is a. A different, very differently ordered world, a differently ordered humanity than paradise, very obviously, right. There's a stark contrast between that age and the Age which preceded it. And then when we come to the flood, the way the flood is very deliberately described, so the flood comes, this is our big transition event again. And the flood is very deliberately described in terms of the uncreation of the world."}

God separated the waters above from the waters below. And we read, you know, the springs come up and the water comes down from the firmament that he put there to separate them. The dry land disappears back into the sea. Right. The world gets unmade, right. It goes lapses back into the primordial chaos outside of the ark. Right. In which the order of the world is preserved. That's part of what's signified, by the way, by the fact that there are clean and unclean animals on the ark, even though the Torah hasn't been given yet. Right. That order is part of what's being preserved there. Not just the life, but also the order is preserved in the ark as sort of a microcosm. And then the world is recreated, the water recedes from the dry land. Right. Everything is separated again, put back in order. But it's a new order. And so this new age begins after the flood, leading up to, to Abraham. Right, Meaning we're talking about what happens with the Tower of Babel."}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #070 - 2023-06-22 - Millennium - Bug or Feature -","start":2598.74,"end":2746.81,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Then we have this other transitional moment, right. And then a big important one. Right. Obviously that's going to be very important as we, as we go forward, the critical age in the Old Testament, because really, Genesis at all these ages we've been discussing, Genesis is the prologue to the Torah, which begins at Exodus. Right. And so we have this very critical moment for the age that is going to predominate in the well, which is going to be basically the Hebrew Bible and predominate in the Christian Old Testament, which is the age that's initiated by the giving of the Torah at Sinai. Because when the, the Torah is given at Sinai, there is a fundamentally new order of things. Israel now exists as a nation when the covenant is given, when the, when the Torah is received at Mount Sinai. Israel as it comes into existence now has a different relationship to the 70 nations and a role to play. There is an order within Israel of the high priest, the priests, the people, right? They have the concentric circles we've talked about of holiness that has to be maintained, leading out into the nations. Israel comes to serve as priests for the nations. Right. Even as the priests proper serve as the priests for Israel, right? This order is established when the Torah is given that world. That age then is initiated. And that age ends when Judah goes into exile. The temple is destroyed, Judah goes into exile. And the return from exile then initiates this new age, this post exilic age, this post exilic period which Daniel refers to as the Great Tribulation. So I know we're already upsetting. This is going to be a rough night for our dispensationalist friends."}

So when Daniel talks about the Great Tribulation, he's talking about his own era and the era to come in his prophetic visions that describe the coming of Alexander, the coming of, ultimately the coming of the Romans, right? And so this period, why is this a Great Tribulation? Well, because this is a period when what's left of Israel, right, Judea, the tribe of Judah, tribe of Benjamin, some Levites, right? That's sort of the remnant that's left in which they are not in control of their own land. They're under the oppression of foreign powers. The abomination of desolation happens. When you do get some kind of independent Judea under the Hasmoneans, they're throwing the Torah out left and right. Right to the point you have John Hyrcanus being both king and high priest at the same time. They're playing fast and loose with the Scriptures. The temple gets rebuilt, but then gets built upon by Herod, who's an Idumean, also not a great guy, morally, right? So from the perspective of all the way up until the time of Christ, right, The time of Christ's incarnation, time when he calls his disciples, the time when he's preaching in Galilee and Judea all the way up to that time period, this is what is considered the Great Tribulation. And the idea is that this great Tribulation is going to be ended when the Messiah comes to deliver his people. When the Messiah comes to deliver Israel, that's going to be the hinge point again. That's going to inaugurate the next age. And from their perspective, all they had to do to prove that the Messiah hadn't come yet was kind of look around, things are terrible. This is still, if you talk to an orthodox Jewish person today, this is their biggest point of counter evidence. When they're going to say that Jesus is not the Messiah is, they'll say, look around, does this look like to you?"}

And it is a kind of worship that demands the sacrifice of children and family. Right. And social bonds. Right. It is sort of, you know, everything solid melts into air. Right. It's. It's just this corrosive. Right. Aspect. And so, I mean, I. I think there is. There is definitely something there. Right. As Father Andrew said. Right. We can't, like, you know, demons don't wear a name tag that says, like, hello My name is, you know, Mammon. My name is Moloch. I'm the exact same guy who was in that idol in the Valley of Hinnom. Right. You know, but that is definitely the thread, right, that has been behind a lot of the drive, the drive of our society. And this has a concrete thing, right? In the United States, Roe v. Wade gets overturned and immediately Amazon steps up and says, oh, we'll pay for abortions. We don't want people taking maternity leave. We want to keep them at work. Right. And you look at the way, you know, at a certain point in the mid 20th century, women get told, hey, we're going to empower you. We're going to liberate you from being chained to the oven. You're going to be able to go out and have a career. And then women entering the workforce creates an abundance of labor, drives down wages, and now everybody needs to have a two income household. Go figure. And instead of being free, now everybody's enslaved to have to work just to try to support themselves where they used to be able to be supported on one income and what that's done to the family. And now in states all over the US at least they're trying to repeal child labor laws and lower the working age. So soon it's going to be all the teenage kids are going to have to go out and get jobs to support their families too. And so when I talk about the corrosion of social bonds, I'm not just talking on a theoretical level, I'm talking about at a really practical level that our worship of this prosperity and success and indulgence and a lifestyle is destroying our social bonds and destroying our humanity. And if that's not demonic, I sort of don't know what is. So all that is to say, yes."}

It gets spelled in different ways in English, like eon, like e O, n, but. But also A E, o n, which betrays its roots. Right. So in English, we get it from Latin and Latin just borrows it straight from Greek aon. Right. So it's. It's directly descended from the Greek term that we're talking about earlier. And ultimately it comes from a proto Indo European root that seems to have meant something like lifetime or a long time, but also even used to mean things like eternity as well. Yeah. So there's another related Greek word which is a spelled alpha, epsilon, yota, which means always. And there's a good old archaic English word aye, aye, which isn't really used very much anymore except to mean. Yes, but like in a naval context, like I, Aye, sir. Right, but."}

So the age to which, during the Great Tribulation, as we said, the people at the time of Christ we're looking forward to, is the Messianic age, right? The age of the Christ, of the Messiah. And so they, when they talk about it in, in Jewish literature, when they talk about the transition, they tend to compare it to previous transitional events, right? So they're looking forward to this transition. Like this event is going to happen, the coming of the Messiah that is going to transition us into this Messianic age. And so as a way to understand it before the fact, they look to previous transitions. So, for example, when you read the Anakic literature, the anarchic literature is. Is all using the days of Noah and the approaching of the flood to talk about the coming of the Messiah and the coming of the day of the Lord. Right. The day of Yahweh by way of comparison. Right. So this is narrated in 1st Enoch to a lesser degree in 2 Enoch, where in 1st Enoch, repeatedly. Because 1st Enoch is this composite of several different texts. But we have. There's a book of Noah that's incorporated into First Enoch, right. That's sort of directly dealing with this, the birth of Noah, and Noah being portrayed as this messianic figure through whom the world is going to be saved. And they're going to transition into this new age free from all the sin and wickedness of that age."}

And so we get this idea that. Right. And they portray Noah's day. We don't see actually described in the text of Scripture that there's this Sort of direct persecution of Noah and his family, right, that sort of the surrounding people are out to destroy him. But that does become a factor in the Anakic literature because again, this comparison is being made to the great tribulation and the things that are happening to Judea, right, during this period from which no one's going to deliver them. And so they're looking at, okay, let's look at that transition and use that as a window into this transition that we're hoping and praying for as we go through this period of tribulation. So that's in the Anakic literature that's pretty much extra biblical. But bits of that do come into the New Testament, right? As in the days of Noah, right, when people are being married and given in marriage before the flood came. So will it be in the day of the Son of Man when Christ returns. Right. So you see some of those themes get picked up and used in a slightly different way in the New Testament once Jesus of Nazareth has come as the Messiah. Probably the most well known way though, in which this is described prospectively, right, Looking forward from the Old Testament is as a new covenant, that a new covenant is going to come. And when it's talked about in terms of a new covenant, we have to remember that what's being talked about here, what's really happening here is that this transitional event that's going to lead into the Messianic age is being compared to the giving of the covenant of Mount Sinai, which was that transitional moment into the age of the Hebrew scriptures. Right? Into the age of most of the Old Testament. Right. And so this is again a comparison being made to a transitional event, right? In this case, not the flood, but the giving of the Torah at Sinai. Right. And the, the ordering of the world and of Israel's place in it that happened at that time. And probably the most famous Hebrew Bible slash Christian Old Testament text regarding the new covenant comes from Jeremiah 31."}

There is an empowering to do. That's what's going on here. And so when St. Paul talks about the letter and the Spirit or talks about the law and the Spirit, he's not contrasting these in the sense of saying law bad, spirit good, Right. He's saying the letter, right. Trying to keep the Torah. Historically, Israel failed, right? But now, walking by the Spirit, now we can keep Torah, now we can keep the righteous requirements of the Torah that God has for us empowered by the Holy Spirit. This is what he's getting at. When in Galatians he lays out the fruit of the Spirit, right? Love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self control. Against these things, there is no law, Right. That by the Holy Spirit dwelling within us and producing those fruit, it has the effect of us keeping the Torah. Right. If we love our brother, we're not going to harm him or do evil to him. Right. We're not going to be envious and jealous. Right. If we're at peace, we're not going to be. And so this is the Holy Spirit empowering us to go further. And this isn't just something Father Stephen came up with to argue against Protestantism or to hang out with his cool Paul. Within Judaism, buds in scholarly circles, this is how St. John Chrysostom reads Romans. If you want the key element, you can go and read them his homilies on Romans. The key element of his interpretation all the way through that St. John Chrysostom points out, is that the Holy Spirit empowers us to keep the law, the righteous requirements of the law. As Christians, over and over again, he says that as he's interpreting and reading St. Paul. I know we're not supposed to quote patristics on this show.

And this is particularly popular in English reform circles more than continental reform circles, though there's some of it in continental reform circles, but it's primarily in English reform, meaning Presbyterian circles. Covenant theology takes this paradigm of the age inaugurated by the giving of the covenant at Sinai, and then the messianic age is inaugurated by the giving of the new covenant, and then takes that covenant framework and uses it as the lens through which the whole scriptures are read. Doing that in some cases provides helpful insights and in some cases is reductionist, meaning it causes you to miss things. Right. Because when all you've got is a hammer, everything starts looking like a nail. You start trying to hammer screws in, it doesn't go so well, and you start missing things because you've got this very narrow grid that you're looking at things through. And then in actual reformed covenant theology, it kind of gets out of control and goes to the point where you're talking about intra trinitarian covenants in eternity. Right.

I was raised with this stuff. It was taught in most of the churches that I grew up in. I mean, and at least the way that it filtered down to, you know, me as a kid, I guess. But I think this is still generally true with dispensationalists. The key parts is the idea that God sets up this dispensation of the Old Testament, and this is how you get salvation, is by obeying the law. And then. And you know, that dispensation is still in play for Jews now. They can obey all the law and they'll be saved. Right. And then there's another dispensation, which is the dispensation of grace. And that's how Christians get saved. You become a Christian by. By doing that. And so there's this. There's this. It's not just the idea that there's different eras, but like, there's different deals that you can attain salvation through. You can either go obey all the law, or you can accept Jesus into your heart and acknowledge him as the Lord of your life. You know, and I mean, there's a lot of people that still, like, they'll say things like, you know, Judaism is completely valid, and if you really do that, then you can be saved, but Christianity also. And so there's this kind of side by side, two different paths that you can potentially take. And that's the way that it kind of plays out for a lot of people. Of course. I mean, this not only has big theological implications, but it has geopolitical implications and all kinds of other stuff that we don't need to get into. But I mean, dispensational thing is really Lincoln's fault. Yeah, yeah, it."}

And so there's this fundamental discontinuity between the dispensations rather than continuity. Right. They are fundamentally Different. They are separate. There's no overlap. The Venn diagram is two circles next to each other, Right. Of the. Of the dispensations. So how is, how is a dispensation or even a covenant really right in the way it's talked about in Covenant theology? How is that different than what we're talking about when we talk about these different ages? Right. So when we talk about different ages, we're talking about different metaphysical realities, even though metaphysical reality is kind of redundant. We're talking about different structuring of the cosmos, Right. Different fundamental structurings of the human person, the world in which humans live, and therefore the relationship between and the experience of the world that those humans have. There's a metaphysical element, there's a real element to it that is transformed in these transitions from age to age. Right. This is, by the way, since we're in this New Covenant context, you know, every once in a while I get asked the question, especially around Pentecost, we're talking about Pentecost. Well, now everyone has the Holy Spirit, the Old Covenant. Only these certain select people had the Holy Spirit. We've talked about this on the show before, right. Well, how's it different? Does it feel different? I could ask this question. Did humans in the Old Covenant who didn't have the Holy Spirit within them feel differently than I feel now, having been grizzly?"}

I learned recently, and I'm sure I'm getting this wrong on some level, but I learned recently that Korean, the Korean language, like, has different sets of verbs and vocabulary that you use depending on the formality of the relationship of the other person you're talking to.

And then, of course, at the end of his Gospel and at the beginning of Acts, we get the coming of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost, it's important to remember that this is Pentecost. Right.

Where ages are reflected in thousands of years, right. As in a thousand years. And this is a tradition that you find in throughout sort of Second Temple Judaism.

But so where does it come from? Right. So most of the kind of trinitarian heresies and Christological heresies find their origin in some rejection of the orthodox view. Right. Either because someone finds that the orthodox view to be nonsensical or doesn't understand it or misunderstands it, or has some reason why they want to reject the traditional orthodox view, whereas this view grows up a little differently. It has a little bit different genealogy. Right. Sort of as chiliasm forms. And it's really grounded originally in the kind of thinking that led the Pharisees within Second Temple Judaism to hold to the bodily resurrection. So we're sort of coming back to the bodily resurrection. So as you know, even if you've just read the Book of Acts, right, there's sort of the famous scene in the Book of Acts, the Acts of the Apostles, where St. Paul is confronted by a mixed group of Pharisees and Sadducees. And so he kind of throws up a distraction by saying, oh, I'm here because of the resurrection, because the Pharisees believe in the resurrection and the Sadducees don't, right? It gets them all sort of fighting amongst themselves about it. So the fact that this is a specifically a Pharisaic belief within the various sects, right, this is one of the identifying beliefs of the Pharisees. And they come to hold to the importance of the bodily resurrection, the importance of affirming the bodily resurrection which is present there as far back as Job, at least in the Hebrew. By the way, Greek Bible folks, I like Greek Old Testament tradition as much as anybody, but the Hebrew of Job contains a much firmer specific declaration of the bodily resurrection than the Greek does. But. So this is. This is an element. But. But the Pharisees are going to insist on the importance of this, right? That this is not just some kind of speculative hope or something, but that this is an important. This is doctrinally important. It's dogma, basically. And that's because of their understanding of justice, right? And you can see the kind of tension that they're wanting to resolve. For example, when you compare Psalm 1 and Psalm 2, Psalm 1 and 2 have the same numbers. In Hebrew and Greek, it's not Psalm 0 and 1. In Greek, it's 1 and 2. What? So Psalm 1 is very much in the vein of the righteous man is like a tree planted by a river, and the wicked man is blown away. It's the righteous prosper, the wicked perish. Boom. Yes. We all agree that's the way things should be. That's the order in the world. And then you get to Psalm 2 and it's like, how long will the wicked prosper? Because we look around in the world and we see that a lot of times that's not the case, that the righteous are oppressed and the righteous suffer, and the wicked seem in this life to prosper. A lot of them die without sort of getting their comeuppance, without there being any kind of justice. For their wickedness. Right. And from that perspective, right. From a Jewish perspective that's immersed deep in the Hebrew scriptures, this is a problem that has to be resolved. And it can't just be resolved by saying, well, they go to heaven somewhere or they have a pleasant afterlife and these other people have a bad afterlife. Right. That kind of nebulous spiritual answer is unreal to them. Right. This is a place where this kind of thinking really is directly antithetical to Platonism. So for Plato, with other place we talked about, the bodily resurrection tonight was in terms of St. Augustine's view of history. But, you know, for Plato, the spiritual, the immaterial, the invisible, the eternal is the most real, and the physical, the material is the least real. Right. It's like a shadow of an image. Right. And this is the reverse. Right. So just some kind of happy, ephemeral afterlife does not solve the problem, Right. Of a righteous person having received curses rather than blessings."}

And God rested upon the seventh day from all his works. This is an account of the things formerly created, as also, it is a prophecy of what is to come.

Okay, another one again from book 5, chapter or part 33. Christ, after he had given thanks while holding the cup and had drunk of it and given it to the disciples, said to them, but I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of the fruit of this vine until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom. Thus then he will himself renew the inheritance of the earth and will reorganize the mystery of the glory of his sons. As David says, he who hath renewed the face of the earth, he promised to drink of the fruit of the vine with his disciples, thus indicating both on these points the inheritance of the earth in which the new fruit of the vine is drunk, and the resurrection of his disciples in the flesh. For the new flesh which rises again is the same which also received the new cup. And he cannot by any means be understood as drinking of the fruit of the vine when settled down with his disciples above in a super celestial place. Nor again are they who drink it devoid of flesh. For to drink of that which flows from the vine pertains to flesh and not spirit. So you could read this in Achilles way, I guess, saying that this eschatological Eucharist will only happen. I don't know. I'm falling apart trying to make it work. Ecclesiastically, it's just an affirmation of the bodily resurrection. Like this is going to happen in the body."}

And in each one of the shoots 10,000 clusters. And on every one of the clusters 10,000 grapes. And every grape when pressed will give five and 20 metrities of wine.

After that, he must be released for a little while. Then I saw thrones. And seated on them were those to whom the authority to judge was committed. Also I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for the testimony of Jesus and for the word of God. And those who had not worshipped the beast or its image, and had not received its mark on their foreheads or their hands, they came to life and reigned with Christ for a thousand years. The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were ended. This is the first Resurrection, blessed and holy, is the one who shares in the first resurrection over such. The second death has no power, but they will be priests of God and of Christ, and they will reign with him for a thousand years.

When we read that now with that background, it's pretty clear what it's talking about, right?

But having laid out all the background, when you read it, and you read it in light of Daniel 7, and you read it in light of Jeremiah 31 and Ezekiel and Isaiah, right? And these other things we've read in Psalm 110 and everything else, it's pretty obvious, right, what St. John is talking about here, right? So there is this binding of the devil, right? This binding of Satan where he's thrown into the pit and sealed from for this age, this era, right? And of course, this is language that. This is language that Christ used about binding the strongman and pillaging his wares. This is in the icon of the resurrection and the harrowing of Hades, right.

So I thought for a while about what I would say at the end because there's so many different directions that one could take with a lot of what we said last time. I kind of spent a little time saying, you know, dispensationalism is not good for you. One of the things that I like to talk about a lot because I think it's really needed these days, is this question of hope. And a lot of times Christians look around us and we see that there's a lot of bad stuff going on in the world. And we might feel hopeless, right? We might quote some of those lines from the Psalms, you know, how long, Lord, how long? Right? And some, if they feel particularly hopeless, might be tempted by the arguments that essentially say, this is all just pretend. This is all just pretend. You guys, you've been calling out to your God for thousands of years and he still has not showed up. I mean, this is a basic kind of apologetic against Christianity. And it's tempting, right? It's tempting to accept that idea, but the only way that that's really acceptable is with a very, very fundamental myopia about the history of humanity. And what do I mean by that? Well, especially here in 21st century America, our sense of history is. I'm not going to say it's zero, but it's approaching zero. You know, I've had the opportunity, thank God, to get to go to some places where you can't hardly kick a rock and not find an archaeological site of some kind. You know, and a lot of other places in the world have a, a much deeper sense of their own history. But the modern world in general is kind of arranged to make that harder. But I think even more in America than probably most other places in the world. So myopia is the default. Historical myopia is the default way that we function and even within the scope of our own lives. The way that I feel today is how I think about my life, right? But if we take a step back and we see that we are living in this millennium of the Messianic age of Christ. Messianic age of Christ, That's a little redundant. But you know what I mean, this is the period where Christ is ruling. And we see, like Father Stephen was just saying, we look at the historical reality of how things were 2000 plus years ago versus how they are now. There's this radical change in the world. I'm not saying that things are great again. It says in Scripture that he's in the midst of his enemies. So the enemies are still here. They're not as not all here. Lots are gone, lots are defeated, lots have been kicked out and sent into the abyss. So we can expect that there's still going to be bad stuff. But nonetheless, the world is a very, very different place than it used to be. And when we zoom back into our own lives and assess, where would I be without Christ? How would I even understand life without Christ? Then we begin to see that his ruling in the midst of his enemies is not a reality. That's just kind of on a grand scale in the scope of human history or grand in the scope of geography across the whole planet. But it is within my life as well, right? That if he's ruling in the midst of his enemies, then I should expect also, if I'm going to be with Christ, to be in the midst of his enemies. So I should expect my life to include demonic attack. I mean, the Lord said, in this world you'll have trouble. But he also said, be of good cheer for I have overcome the world. So that fundamental victory has been won. And so what's happening now is the enemy is in retreat. They're sacking, they're burning as they go, but they're being, they've been routed and they're being chased down by the saints on behalf of Christ. Christ is doing this in them, right? And so our task is to participate in that, not to just feel and feel bad and to complain often, right? Or maybe even to give ourselves to despair that we are experiencing trouble, that our hope is fundamentally not just thinking, well, you know, things are bad, but maybe it'll get better someday, whatever. But our hope is actually in our participation in the work of Christ to cleanse this world from demonic influence, to bring about his order and beauty and justice and love and kindness and all of these things, you know, his ministry, that we are to be partake participants in his ministry and that the more that we are faithful, then the more that our hope grows. That's the way that it works, right? So when we talk about the millennium, when we talk about the Messianic age, it's not just so we can make big charts to put on the wall and say, ah, this is how it's all laid out. I mean, I love maps and charts and stuff, but that's not what it's about. It's fundamentally about having the perspective that we need in order to be faithful, to do his work in the places where we are and to participate in his putting all of his enemies under his feet and going into all the world, preaching the gospel, baptizing, teaching everyone to do all that he has commanded. Father."}

Ta da. He's not a killer. I mean, that was a little bit. But that's not the main reason. The main reason is that I think by working through that, hopefully it's kind of made plain that chiliasm and its sort of distant cousin, modern pre millennialism is not really a satisfactory answer to Gnosticism, because as we sort of talked about, it's kind of based on the same principles. It's based on this principle of setting the material world and the good things in it and the enjoyment of it over against the spiritual world and spiritual things and saying one is more real or more important than the other."}

And that problem is that the good things of this world and the enjoyment of thereof are pushed off into the future, not now, but someday. And this is part of what lies behind the comparison I made between the millennium and Achilles in an ancient Kilias scheme and sort of Muslim heaven. So one of the features of heaven in Islam is that suddenly you're allowed to indulge in all kinds of things that are sinful when you're alive on earth, can't drink alcohol when you're alive on earth, but all of a sudden all the wine you want right in paradise, etc, etc."}

And that again points to a shared sort of Gnostic view of asceticism, that asceticism is denying yourself the world because not because of trading something good for something better, but because it's not really good, but maybe it will become good in some later phase, in some later world, in some later age, or at least you'll be given permission within that context to do what otherwise you would not be permitted to do. I think one of the importance is if we really embrace the truth of the fact that we are living in the Messianic age, we are living in that age in which the Holy Spirit has been poured out upon all flesh. We are members of the new covenant we've been grafted in, as St. Paul talks about as Christian, is that that means that all of that imagery and all of those promises of richness and abundance and peace and enjoyment."}

The Church, the Orthodox Church, is not just about fasting, it's also about feasting. It's not just about denial, but it's also about acceptance of one another. It's not just about going off by yourself into the wilderness to pray, but it's also about the monastic who does go off by himself into the wilderness to pray and draw close to God and come to know Christ deeply, throwing open the doors of his monastic cell to receive visitors and to pass on the wisdom and the sanctification that he's received the holiness he's received to those who come to visit him and who need it. And I think it's very easy because I've seen it on the faces of a lot of folks, especially newly orthodox folks, to think that Orthodoxy is about being very serious and very even dour, and about fasting even more than is required, and about holding yourself apart from other people and about not laughing and about not enjoying yourself. And joy, of course, is a fruit of the Spirit. God has given us the good things and the blessings of this world for us to enjoy and to receive with prayer and thanksgiving and to share with each other. He's given us each other. Not just right. Sometimes we talk about this. We talk about how well we live in community. And so that means we rub up against each other and we bounce off each other and we knock off each other's sharp edges, this is true, but also to enjoy each other."}

St. Paul, when he's talking about the resurrection in First Corinthians, says that if we have the hope of Christ only in this life, meaning if there is no resurrection and we only have the hope of Christ in this life, we of all men should be very much pitied. But what's interesting is sometimes I think that we, while we firmly believe in the resurrection and life of the world to come, and we're looking forward to that, and our hopes are put in that sometimes I think we don't really have the hope of Christ in this life anymore. We've kind of given up on it. We've just accepted this life in this world is going to be a veil of tears and I need to endure to the end, right? And then there is joy and then there is happiness and everything in Christ afterwards. I'm not saying there isn't all of those things afterwards, but all of those things are available to us here and now. St. Paul was in prison in Philippi, shackled to the ground in a pile of mud and feces. And he was singing hymns and praising God. He was not bitterly enduring. He was not, you know, biting his lip and emoting. He was not being stoic. He was rejoicing. How often does St. Paul read Philippians? You can read it in one sitting very easily. I know someone who memorized the whole thing. How many times does St. Paul call on us to rejoice, to rejoice in the Lord to rejoice in each other, to rejoice in the salvation we received. I think we need to take seriously that this is the Messianic age. We need to take feasting with each other, right? With each other. Not gluttony, not over drinking, right? But with each other, feasting with each other, enjoying each other as seriously as we take fasting, at least as seriously as we take our fasts. And as we take Lent, we need to take Pascha and the whole Pascha season as seriously as we take Lent in the Lenten season. And I think when we do that, we'll see just how bad an error it is to project all of that joy and that fellowship and that communion with each other out into the future as if it's not available to us."}
