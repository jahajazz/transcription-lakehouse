And he will be the light of the nations and the hope of those whose hearts are troubled. All who dwell on the earth will fall down and worship him. And they will praise and bless and celebrate with song the lord of spirits. First Enoch, chapter 48, verses 4 through 5. The modern world doesn't acknowledge, but is nevertheless haunted by spirits, angels, demons and saints. In our time, many yearn to break free of the prison of a flat secular materialism, to see and to know reality as it truly is. What is this spiritual reality like? How do we engage with it? Well, how do we permeate everyday life with spiritual presence? Orthodox Christian priests Father Andrew Stephen Damick and Father Stephen DeYoung host this live call in show focused on enchantment in creation, the union of the seen and unseen as made by God and experienced by mankind throughout history. Welcome to the Lord of Spirits."}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #024 - 2021-07-22 - Apocalypse Now and Then","start":146.81,"end":201.84,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Right, right, right. So we know that when we titled this episode Apocalypse now, and then a lot of people got excited that we were going to talk about the end of the world. We know it and you know, it's great, starts with an earthquake, birds, snakes, airplanes. But that's not actually what this episode is about. Apocalypse isn't actually just a word that means the end of the world turns out to be a biblical genre. But before we get to that, and you know, we always take a while to get where we're going, we want to back up to our previous episode on the Noose, because this episode is its sequel. Now, we got a lot of questions about thoughts from our last episode, and the one that kept coming up was this one. Does the idea that all of our thoughts coming from outside mean that every single thing we think is being whispered to us by God, an angel or a demon? So, Father Stephen, is that what we meant?"}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #024 - 2021-07-22 - Apocalypse Now and Then","start":203.28,"end":203.68,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"No."}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #024 - 2021-07-22 - Apocalypse Now and Then","start":212.24,"end":215.52,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"No, comma, celebratory. Yes. Okay, there we go."}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #024 - 2021-07-22 - Apocalypse Now and Then","start":217.96,"end":219.04,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Clarify. Right, yes."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #024 - 2021-07-22 - Apocalypse Now and Then","start":219.6,"end":228.43,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"And everyone, hopefully you've marked on your bingo cards. We're about to back up to something we talked about last time to clarify it here at the beginning of this episode."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #024 - 2021-07-22 - Apocalypse Now and Then","start":228.51,"end":228.99,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Indeed."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #024 - 2021-07-22 - Apocalypse Now and Then","start":229.15,"end":253.07,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"So that's a free spot for everybody. Yeah. So the stuff we were talking about last time was a little bit complicated, maybe a little bit in depth. So now we're going to just throw everyone in the deep end at the beginning of this episode as we sort of clarify where we ended up last time."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #024 - 2021-07-22 - Apocalypse Now and Then","start":253.41,"end":261.17,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"You know, when you said complicated, I started forming an Avril Lavigne related joke in my head, but just didn't quite get there. So."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #024 - 2021-07-22 - Apocalypse Now and Then","start":261.41,"end":270.17,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Right. Like that the original Avril Lavigne or the before she was crisis actor Avril Lavigne, who has taken her place."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #024 - 2021-07-22 - Apocalypse Now and Then","start":270.17,"end":273.29,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Yeah, yeah, we should have a doppelganger episode."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #024 - 2021-07-22 - Apocalypse Now and Then","start":273.29,"end":290.22,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"There we go. So to start with, and believe it or not, this is hopefully going to help clarify what, what we were talking about last time with the news. We're going to start by talking about pre reflective consciousness."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #024 - 2021-07-22 - Apocalypse Now and Then","start":291.9,"end":297.42,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"When I woke up this morning, I said to myself, today I want to talk about pre reflective consciousness."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #024 - 2021-07-22 - Apocalypse Now and Then","start":297.82,"end":302.7,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"But then you had already reflected and so it was. It was all over, self defeating."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #024 - 2021-07-22 - Apocalypse Now and Then","start":302.7,"end":303.1,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Yeah."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #024 - 2021-07-22 - Apocalypse Now and Then","start":303.1,"end":304.87,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Right, so."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #024 - 2021-07-22 - Apocalypse Now and Then","start":305.19,"end":314.83,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"So, okay, so what, what does that mean for those of us who are not, you know, reading the latest in, in psychological. I don't even know the right noun."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #024 - 2021-07-22 - Apocalypse Now and Then","start":314.83,"end":320.07,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"For this, but yes, existential psychology and phenomenology. Yeah, correct."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #024 - 2021-07-22 - Apocalypse Now and Then","start":320.71,"end":321.11,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Right."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #024 - 2021-07-22 - Apocalypse Now and Then","start":321.35,"end":361.81,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"So, right. So this is, this is another way of talking about what we were talking about last time with the noose in terms of a point of attention. Right. And the news is a sensory organ in a point of attention or a point of focus. But the, the term pre reflective consciousness is Talking about it's pre reflective because it's sort of this, this level of consciousness before you get to thoughts. That's the pre reflective. Right, right. Before you get to the actual thoughts, before you get to the stream of consciousness."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #024 - 2021-07-22 - Apocalypse Now and Then","start":361.81,"end":371.13,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Yeah. This sort of, kind of direct apprehension, you know, where you don't have to think about something in order to, to, to get it, you just sort of receive it."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #024 - 2021-07-22 - Apocalypse Now and Then","start":372.09,"end":381.37,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Yeah, yeah, yeah. I, all of a sudden I was about to use the term fundamental apperception that I realized that would not help. So. But too late. I already."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #024 - 2021-07-22 - Apocalypse Now and Then","start":381.45,"end":383.13,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Come on, I'm barely getting this stuff."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #024 - 2021-07-22 - Apocalypse Now and Then","start":384.8,"end":406.48,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Right. So this is going back to that stream of consciousness is not you. Right. And so when we talk about pre reflective consciousness, we mean that this point of attention is back before that, which the important part of that is that that means you can focus it on or your mind can look at or your mind can consider whatever language you want to use for this. Right."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #024 - 2021-07-22 - Apocalypse Now and Then","start":406.8,"end":408.8,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Contemplate maybe yourself."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #024 - 2021-07-22 - Apocalypse Now and Then","start":409.36,"end":486.56,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Right, you can contemplate yourself. And so that means the news. This, this kind of consciousness we're talking about has to be sort of before yourself so that you can look at and think about yourself as an object and come to know yourself. Right. So it's possible to live in an unreflective way and not know yourself or not know yourself very well. Right, right, right. And this is something that's sort of a constant in both ancient philosophical literature and ancient Christian literature is the idea of coming to know oneself. That, that's the beginning of knowledge. Right. Is to come to know your own soul and your own self. And so the noose has again, has to be. Prior to that. It can't, it can't be. When we say I am thinking, right. The I is ourself. So that means we're starting with ourself. We're not thinking about ourself. Right. And then we're talking about, you know, something then related to ourselves. And so when we talk about the noose, this is back behind our sense of ourself."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #024 - 2021-07-22 - Apocalypse Now and Then","start":486.8,"end":524.49,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Yeah. So like for instance, you know, I've had a lot of pastoral conversations in which I might say something like, listen to your own thoughts. So if you're listening to your thoughts, you're observing your thoughts, whatever you are, you know, your thoughts aren't thinking. Aren't thinking your thoughts. You're thinking your thoughts. There's a you that can, that can observe the thoughts, you know, that can actually kind of. It's not dissociative exactly. But, but you realize that they are not you. I think that's my understanding of what we're talking about now."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #024 - 2021-07-22 - Apocalypse Now and Then","start":525.21,"end":530.09,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Right. And so then you can also think about you. You can think about yourself."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #024 - 2021-07-22 - Apocalypse Now and Then","start":530.57,"end":531.45,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Yeah, right."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #024 - 2021-07-22 - Apocalypse Now and Then","start":531.45,"end":536.73,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"And to use an analogy, if you have a weird feeling in your gut."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #024 - 2021-07-22 - Apocalypse Now and Then","start":537.13,"end":537.53,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Right."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #024 - 2021-07-22 - Apocalypse Now and Then","start":538.01,"end":600.48,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"You can sit there and think about what is going on in my gut and try to ponder what's happening. This is the same kind of thing, but in your mind or in your soul. Yeah, right. That you could say, what is going on in my mind? Right, right. What is going on in my soul? Because there's. There's this. There's this pre. Reflective level consciousness. The noose is separate. And this is. This is also what's being talked about. We had a call last time where we got into a little bit whether the spirit and the soul are different things. And we talked about how some of the fathers, they're sort of used as being the same thing, just referring to the immaterial part of a person and then other fathers. There seems to be a distinction. And so when there's a distinction, the spirit is referring to this. This to the noose, to the noetic part of a human person. Right."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #024 - 2021-07-22 - Apocalypse Now and Then","start":600.48,"end":604.92,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Yeah. Because sometimes spirit and soul are used as basically synonyms."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #024 - 2021-07-22 - Apocalypse Now and Then","start":605.4,"end":605.8,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Right?"}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #024 - 2021-07-22 - Apocalypse Now and Then","start":606.2,"end":607.08,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Yeah. Right."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #024 - 2021-07-22 - Apocalypse Now and Then","start":607.8,"end":609,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"It's just all lumped together."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #024 - 2021-07-22 - Apocalypse Now and Then","start":609.4,"end":703.86,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Yeah. Right. Because. Yeah, some of the fathers talk about body and soul. Some talk about body, soul and spirit as three separate things. Yeah. And, you know, I think it's. Well, number one, it's important to realize that even though we're talking about this stuff in this way, obviously we're not necessarily using strictly biblical terminology because the Bible doesn't talk in this way, but it does speak in a way that is evincing the same things we're discussing. So, for instance, in the Psalms, where the writer addresses his own soul. Right. Oh, my soul, my soul. You know, and I mean, we have, you know, we have lots of church hymns like that. You know, the big one from the great canon of Saint Andrew of Crete, the Kentuckian, My soul, my soul arise. You know, or, you know, in the Psalms, bless the Lord, O my soul. Right. And, you know, so much of what we talk about in the show is about kind of saying, okay, what if what's in the scripture is not always a metaphor? Like we seem to so often take it as being, you know, what if you actually can talk to your soul? What if you can observe your soul? You know, what if it's not quite the same thing as the you. Right. And of course, that means that, you know, Descartes famous dictum, cogito ergo sum, I think, therefore I am is actually wrong because you're not your thoughts. You're not your thoughts and thinking is not what makes you you."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #024 - 2021-07-22 - Apocalypse Now and Then","start":704.42,"end":706.82,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"But by the way, do you, do you know how he died?"}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #024 - 2021-07-22 - Apocalypse Now and Then","start":707.7,"end":709.54,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"I do not remember how he died."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #024 - 2021-07-22 - Apocalypse Now and Then","start":709.54,"end":711.46,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"He was trampled by a horse."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #024 - 2021-07-22 - Apocalypse Now and Then","start":712.9,"end":713.38,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Wow."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #024 - 2021-07-22 - Apocalypse Now and Then","start":713.38,"end":717.94,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"It is true. And that is the origin of the saying, never put Descartes before."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #024 - 2021-07-22 - Apocalypse Now and Then","start":718.34,"end":721.7,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Oh God, I felt like I was walking into something."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #024 - 2021-07-22 - Apocalypse Now and Then","start":722.02,"end":723.78,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"You were. It was a trap."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #024 - 2021-07-22 - Apocalypse Now and Then","start":723.94,"end":728.06,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"But that's okay. I'm gonna look up on Wikipedia to find out. He really did die."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #024 - 2021-07-22 - Apocalypse Now and Then","start":728.06,"end":729.7,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"He did really die. He was really dying."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #024 - 2021-07-22 - Apocalypse Now and Then","start":730.42,"end":734.13,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Oh man. Wow. Okay, so at least it is a well founded joke then."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #024 - 2021-07-22 - Apocalypse Now and Then","start":734.13,"end":757.57,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Yeah, so yeah, just a certain irony. But, but right, and yeah, as, as you said, you know, and this is something that the Church Fathers said very quickly. Right. They said, you know, in order to, in our Greek language describe what's going on in the scriptures, we sometimes have to use terms that are not themselves in the scriptures."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #024 - 2021-07-22 - Apocalypse Now and Then","start":758.07,"end":759.35,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Yeah, right, right."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #024 - 2021-07-22 - Apocalypse Now and Then","start":759.75,"end":795.52,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"And that doesn't mean you're importing theology or you're importing philosophy that's foreign to Christianity just because those terms are used right. In, in philosophy per se. This is one of the common misconceptions about the Church Fathers by a lot of our friends. Friends, mostly our non Orthodox friends, but even some of our Orthodox friends that they just brought in all of this Greek philosophy rather than just, you know, they're using the Greek language."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #024 - 2021-07-22 - Apocalypse Now and Then","start":796.16,"end":837.08,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Yeah, there's, I mean for those who have that, for those who are receiving that thought, there is a wonderful book called Christianity and Classical Culture by Yaroslav Pelikan which addresses this very directly. And actually he shows how the Church Fathers take Greek terminology but then put different meanings into it. They're not just simply importing philosophical concepts, they're just using the Greek language and giving new meanings to the words that they're, that they're making use of. So there is, you know, it's a, it's a wonderful book. And of course Pelikan is an unparalleled historian of Christianity, so I do recommend it."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #024 - 2021-07-22 - Apocalypse Now and Then","start":837.8,"end":904.74,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Yes, it is a good book. The key importance, not just for understanding the hymns that you mentioned, for which this understanding is helpful, but also this is important that the nous in some sense is before the self is critically important to our understanding of how humanity has free will. The way Father Dumitru Staniloy, whose name I always mispronounce describes this is that humanity is in some sense absolute meaning, not determined by his physical and material circumstances that we're able to. Because we're able to look at our thoughts from behind our thoughts, look at ourselves from behind ourself. That gives us the freedom to comport ourselves. Right. We can't change reality with our will."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #024 - 2021-07-22 - Apocalypse Now and Then","start":905.3,"end":905.66,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Right."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #024 - 2021-07-22 - Apocalypse Now and Then","start":905.66,"end":915.46,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Right. We can't sort of reach out and bend. There's the brute facticity of reality. But we can choose how we are going to comport ourselves to reality."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #024 - 2021-07-22 - Apocalypse Now and Then","start":915.7,"end":916.02,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Right."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #024 - 2021-07-22 - Apocalypse Now and Then","start":916.02,"end":928.66,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"How we're going to receive what comes into our life and our mind. Right. We have freedom in that because of this distinction. Because of this separation."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #024 - 2021-07-22 - Apocalypse Now and Then","start":928.82,"end":1031.54,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Yeah. Because if you are your thoughts, then that means you are at their mercy. You know, you're simply at their mercy and. And attempting, like. Attempting to. You know, like I. There's been many times I've had pastoral conversations with people where. Where it's like I keep having this thought and I just can't make it go away. And, you know, I feel like something is wrong with me. You know, if. If you are your thoughts, then the answer to that is yes, there's something wrong with you. Right. That's. I mean, what other possible conclusion could you come to? And then people find themselves helpless to just make a thought go away. You can't just will a thought to go away unless you, you know, if you realize that you are not your thoughts, then you can actually begin to develop the discipline to do things to your thoughts. But you're still going to have thoughts that come unbidden. But that doesn't mean that there's something fundamentally flawed. I mean, I can't peer into the mind of Christ, but Christ himself was tempted, but he is not his temptations, obviously, because he did not sin. So hopefully I'm not getting across any Christological lines. I should not by saying that, but I think that seems pretty clear from the Gospels that that's what happened. So, yeah, free, you know, free will is kind of based. Not kind of free will is based in this. That you're not your thoughts. You know, you can observe your own thoughts. You can do things with your thoughts. You can reject the thoughts. You can accept some thoughts. It's. This is a thing and it's very freeing thing. I think. I think we mentioned that last time. It just. The experience of freedom comes, I think, from realizing that."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #024 - 2021-07-22 - Apocalypse Now and Then","start":1032.74,"end":1051.62,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Right, right. And if you look at the other side, Right. If your brain is just sort of a chemical machine that generates your thoughts, right. And then those generated thoughts in your stream of consciousness are you. Then, you know, Sam Harris is right. And free will disappears."}

So, okay, so we have talked about where thoughts come from, that they come from outside. So let's unpack that a little bit more. I mean, we talked last time about the various ways of knowing other than the news. Right. Like there's, you know, techne, which is the know how.

We're not just brains in a vat. You know, there is actual contact with the outside going on in your, in your mind. But I think a lot of our problem is that we tend to reduce knowledge to language. Right. And then this is what we think of as thoughts is a kind of internal monologue, like the things that are being said in my head. But actually, you know, an interesting thing about that is I occasionally see people like posting on social media. They're surprised that people experience an internal monologue because they'll say things like, I don't have an internal monologue. That's not the way that I think. You know, I don't think in words like that. And that's interesting to me. That seems to be an indication that that person has somehow just is approaching it from a different angle.

But when I do that, the experience of me standing in front of a tree, touching a tree, looking at a tree, smelling a tree is very different than having the word tree in my brain.

You know, you can invoke the idea of sadness in someone else by saying it. But, but even then there's kind of different kind, you know, and of course, language tries to deal with the complications. You can see a tree. You can say, okay, it's an oak tree, or it's a maple tree, or it's a Japanese, you know, maple, you know, or something like that. These are all different looking trees. But the Japanese maple that's in my neighbor's backyard does not look like the one in my front yard. And it is an objectively different experience to see those two trees. You know, the one I have is much younger and smaller, and theirs is big and lovely, you know, so even though language can work on those complications and try to become more precise, it's still. It's still. You know, I could. I could qualify it. Oh, it's a small Japanese. Oh, okay. It's a small one, but. But still, the specific one in my yard, you can't. You cannot.

I mean, I see this all the time on the Internet, people arguing Christology. And the way that they argue makes me really wonder whether they know the person they're talking about. You know, it's just. Yeah, yeah. Even if what they're saying is correct factually, you know, it's still not the same thing as the one that they're talking about. About. Yeah. So, I mean, it kind of raises the question, right, If. If there's this knowledge that's beyond language. And for instance, an example might be that, you know, sort of a noetic example is sometimes people. You might go somewhere and you have a feeling like something is. Is just wrong. Like it feels sort of spiritually wrong or. Or spiritually. Right. You know, that there's that sense. But it's not. It's not something that's just pure. That you can get by observation alone. Right. So this would be an example of the noose apprehending spiritual reality. But then that kind of leads you to the question, you know, like, well, do my atheist friends have spiritual experiences? Right. Because they would probably say that they don't. Because they would. Especially if they're really a materialist, a real materialist. They would say that spiritual experiences, there's no such thing as that. There's only the material senses. So, you know, but if. If such experiences are just reduced, are reducible to language. I had a feeling that something was wrong. Right. Well, then you can kind of, much more easily kind of explain it away. And the classic example of that is in A Christmas Carol where when Ebenezer Scrooge, we've all read it, or at least you've watched some film version of it, probably everybody or a sitcom episode riffing on it. Right? Yeah. I mean, this is one of the most reused stories of our time, where he encounters Jacob Marley. I was about to say Bob Marley, but then I remembered it's not."}

So undigested beef, a blot of mustard. You know, essentially he's. He's saying that this unmistakably spiritual experience he's having is just, you know, an indigestion problem. Right. But he's having the experience. And of course, you know, as the story goes, he eventually reconciles himself to that fact, you know, and is able to change as a result of that. But, yeah, he's a disbeliever, and he's explaining it away because for him, it's reducible to some kind of physical process. You know, I just ate the wrong thing last night."}

This represents this, and that represents that, and we try to break it all down into language. But even. Even if you write it up really thoroughly and really well. Right. And you have all your.

This is the thing that that means, you know, and so it becomes a meaning that you received observationally rather than an experience that you participated in through ritual. You know, it becomes a spectator sport, so to speak. Yeah, yeah. Or again, again, again, like, there's. There's a whole history of interpreting the. The Divine Liturgy and other services with these kinds of ways, but they. They're. They're not reducible to that. Like that. That's not the only. It's not like, for instance, when. When, you know, the great entrance happens in the Divine Liturgy, it's not. You're not supposed to get a meaning from that, you know, you're supposed to participate in it, you know. Yeah.

When we divide it up into pieces, then we just pick the one piece that we prefer and kind of leave the rest aside. And I think one of the projects that we're trying to pursue on this podcast is to show that everything really is one. You know, there's not natural and supernatural. Right. That's not. Like we, like. There's a deliberate reason why we use the phrase the seen and the unseen when we're describing what we're doing on this show. Because there's a distinction there. There's things you can see and observe with your senses, and there's things that you cannot see with your sense senses. But. But natural and supernatural is a different kind of distinction.

{"episode_id":"LOS - #024 - 2021-07-22 - Apocalypse Now and Then","start":2228.53,"end":2252.02,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Yeah. And then as that develops, we're not even into the 19th century yet, but you get the beginnings of German idealism and you, you get our friend Immanuel Kant and you get not only sort of the taxonomy of these two realms, but there's sort of an iron wall between them."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #024 - 2021-07-22 - Apocalypse Now and Then","start":2252.42,"end":2252.86,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Yeah."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #024 - 2021-07-22 - Apocalypse Now and Then","start":2252.86,"end":2376.04,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Now where. So for Kant, sort of classically, you have the, the noumenal realm that's what he calls it, Right. Related to the noose, related to the mind, where you have God the self, meaning the soul, the thing in itself, the essences of things. Right. These are all things that can only be known by the mind through what he basically calls a kind of intuition. In religious circles, especially Protestant religious circles, that's how faith ends up getting kind of defined. Faith is that sort of intuitive knowledge of those things, of God and of the soul. And then you have the phenomenal realm, which is all the stuff we know through the senses, which is all the material stuff. Right, right. And these are these two separate boxes. And most conservative Western theology ends up evolving out of this kind of viewpoint. Right. So there's maintained that you. Yes, God exists, the soul exists, the essence. Things have essences, things have natures, things are what they are. But that's something you know by faith or intuition or through the application of mental categories. That's not something you know through the senses or through science or through any of those things. Right, right. So you have these. These two realms. And so this is how we end up as conservative modern Christians, sort of having this box or this set of brackets where we put all that stuff, all that noumenal stuff, and then the rest of our life, everything outside the brackets, we basically interact with everything else the same way atheists do, because that's all in this just phenomenal material realm."}

And so what Hagel does essentially is collapse that idea of a noumenal realm, of a spiritual realm. He collapses Geist and spirit, he just collapses that into the material world."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #024 - 2021-07-22 - Apocalypse Now and Then","start":2428,"end":2429.76,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"So what does that mean? Like, how does that play out?"}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #024 - 2021-07-22 - Apocalypse Now and Then","start":2430.16,"end":2470.11,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Yeah, what that means is that essentially then, right. All of these, everything from God to spirituality to the soul, all of these things sort of get reduced to a kind of spiritual metaphor related to material processes. Right. So you get out of this, and this is what then liberal Western theology evolves from. So you get like the social gospel and liberation theology, Right."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #024 - 2021-07-22 - Apocalypse Now and Then","start":2470.43,"end":2473.79,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"It's all very. This worldly focused."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #024 - 2021-07-22 - Apocalypse Now and Then","start":2474.03,"end":2486,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Right. So spiritual liberation, what spiritual liberation really means in this kind of view is the transforming of the material conditions of your life to give you freedom."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #024 - 2021-07-22 - Apocalypse Now and Then","start":2486.56,"end":2487.52,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Right, right."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #024 - 2021-07-22 - Apocalypse Now and Then","start":2487.92,"end":2539.51,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"That's now spiritual liberation. Right. And so sin gets replaced with tyranny and oppression. Right. Everything gets reduced. So you still have a concept. Right. So for Hegel, God is sort of in the creation, evolving and working things out right along with everybody else. Right. And God is just sort of this animating positive spirit within. Within the. The cosmos. Right. And so that you still use this language to talk about it, and you still see this spiritual dimension, but the spiritual dimension is now more about feeling and sentiment and solidarity, kinship, than an actual connection to an actually existing creator God."}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #024 - 2021-07-22 - Apocalypse Now and Then","start":2543.91,"end":2568.16,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"And so, yeah, so that's. Then, you know, our conservative Western theology comes from sort of more of the Kantian kind of view. And the liberal theology comes out of more the Hegelian kind of view. And from that comes process theology, all of that. All of our 19th century German friends. And so then, you know, the. The response."}

Then this is how secularism comes about. Because then you just, rather than collapsing the spiritual into the physical and the material, you just sort of peel away that layer. You just rip the spiritual and material layer off the top and leave only the physical and material."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #024 - 2021-07-22 - Apocalypse Now and Then","start":2596.43,"end":2655.12,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Yeah, because if it's really just a metaphor, well, why not have some other metaphor? You know, if there's not actually a God that you can encounter, why not come up with some other, you know, way of. Of organizing your values around material flourishing? You know, and what's interesting about this to me is like, this seems to be the way that public discourse is just sort of expected to go now. Like, there's this polite thing that we don't do. Right. Or I should say there's this thing we politely don't do, which is, you know, you don't talk about spiritual things in public because, well, that should be either kept private or it's kind of sort of a joke, you know, that. Don't. Don't talk about that. And I mean, you know, when we were putting our notes together, you gave the example of, you know, Neil Degrasse Tyson, the. Is he an astronomer? Is that what he is? Yeah, I think so."}

You know, aren't they on just on rockets? And I, you know, it's the thing that you're sort of not allowed to say, right. Like this. We just politely don't do that in public. And I was thinking about this in contrast to an experience that I have once every week or so. So my family, we buy, we get raw milk from a Mennonite family about 30 minutes or so, 35, 40 minutes south of us. They have a greenhouse and a dairy farm. And, you know, they make lots of wonderful things. And when you go there, though, they will openly and easily talk to you about. About God and about the weather, usually in relation, one relation to the other, you know, and it just really strikes me at how. And it's not like they're not proselytizing or anything like that. It's just simply their experience of the world and that's how they talk, that they just don't participate in that polite agreement that everybody else has. You know, they have no problem saying, you know, God was really good and gave us really good weather this week, you know, like, it's just something they just sort of openly do, you know, So I think about that when I drink my Mennonite milk."}

But not like at the mall, like, not like, you know, talking to a store clerk, you know. Yeah. And so, yeah, so that's sort of ways it all went wrong, right. In the, in the modern period. And so probably the, the question was, we've gotten most often since starting this show has been like some version of can we really go back to, like, can we like, unmodern? Like, is it possible to demodern oneself?"}

We have to actively work, and that's what the rest of this episode is going to be about. You have to actively work to reintegrate what's been pulled apart."}

They didn't have the rituals that were a participation in Christ's saving work, like the rituals of the rituals of the Torah work. So that is one circumstance for those peoples in the Old Testament. That's Americans, because as Americans did have the Torah, or at least a version of the Torah, I guess you could say, and they held Passover and the various other feasts and festivals, but obviously they were. They separated off and they worked on the wrong in the wrong location. So this was accomplished in their worship as well. And then to bring it to the present for those who are liturgical Christians, who are side of the Orthodox Church, as I say, what is accomplished for them."}

Okay, so I'm just going to restate your question, the way that I understand it. You can tell me if I've got it. You're essentially asking if someone's not actually sort of what we might think of as canonically part of the people of God, whether that's Israel in the Old Covenant or Israel in the New Covenant, which is the church, then what exactly does their worship accomplish, if anything? Is that correct? Am I getting that right?"}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #024 - 2021-07-22 - Apocalypse Now and Then","start":3377.42,"end":3475.23,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Yeah. Yeah. So I have some thoughts on this, which I'll say first, but I know that Father Stephen probably has a lot more to say, but I'll just say this, that whenever someone is being obedient to God, they're being obedient to God. Right. The idea that outside of the canonical boundaries of the people of God, there is nothing but unmitigated darkness is simply not true. Right. It's simply not true. And we have Orthodox saints, for instance, commenting on, you know, even within the past couple of centuries, commenting especially on the problem of, you know, what are often described as separated brethren. And one of the problems with that phrase, of course, is that people tend to emphasize one of those two words over the other. Like they'll really want to emphasize the word separated and forget about brethren or they really want to emphasize brethren, forget about separated. But, you know, like Father George Florovsky said, you really need to emphasize both words. They're both important. But there are Orthodox saints, like, for instance, Saint Siloan the Athonite, and I'm kind of blanking on the name right now, but I think There were some 19th century Russian saints who commented especially on Catholics and Protestants in Russia. And they said, you know, when they do something that we agree with and recognize as our own, we should affirm that. And like they do well to do those things. Like, they never say, well, they're not Orthodox. So, you know, I mean, what are they really doing?"}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #024 - 2021-07-22 - Apocalypse Now and Then","start":3475.23,"end":3475.63,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Right."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #024 - 2021-07-22 - Apocalypse Now and Then","start":3476.51,"end":3489.47,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"So I'm going to go ahead and then punt over to Father Stephen for especially if he wants to comment on that. But especially, you know, the, the Old Testament piece, which I don't know. I mean, we talked about this, but I'm sure he has a lot more to say about that. So."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #024 - 2021-07-22 - Apocalypse Now and Then","start":3489.47,"end":3778.7,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Father yeah, right. So, I mean, what the Midianites and Ishmaelites and Edomites and it's Ishmaelites and Edomites who make up the Midianites. What they're doing when we re encounter them is they're continuing the kind of worship and the patterns of worship that they got from Abraham and Ishmael or Abraham and Isaac and Esau, right? They're continuing those forms of worship. Right. As you mentioned, they hadn't actually received the Torah, you know, which gave the specific, the specific commands. But here's the thing. Those commandments are commandments given to humans. And, and that cuts in two ways. First, they're not restrictions God imposes upon himself. It's not God saying, I am telling you to worship me this way as my people. Therefore, I am now restricting myself to only work here in this place at all, right? And never, never do anything else. And then, secondly, right, liturgy is not the work of the people, right? So ritual isn't something, isn't a process that we do that then results in us having certain benefits, right? Ritual and liturgy is the means given to us by God through which God tells us he will work and do certain things when we are obedient and do the liturgy in that way. So the question, whether we're talking about the Midianites or the Edomites or the Samaritans or Roman Catholics and Protestants or anybody else, the guy living on an island who's never seen an Abrahamic religion in his life, I mean, the question amounts to what is God doing there, right? And the ultimate answer to that is we don't know most of the time. This is the Saint Irenaeus of Leon's famous. We know where the Holy Spirit is. He's in the church, right? And we know what he's doing in the church because God made certain promises to us as to what he would do in the church. But we know he's outside the church, but we don't know what he's doing outside the church always. In fact, most of the time we don't. Sometimes we find out later. You know, some people group comes, comes to faith in Christ, right? And you could go back and look and you can see these sort of seeds like St. Justin Martyr talks about in their previous beliefs and culture that kind of helped lead them to Christ. And you could say, oh well, that was the Holy Spirit, Spirit's doing, right? But in real time we can't always see that. So you know, the Holy Spirit blows where he will and he's doing it. And God can choose to honor what he chooses to honor. He can show mercy on whom he will show mercy and compassion on whom he will show compassion. So the issue is we're accountable for the riches and the wealth that we have received. So those of us who are in the Orthodox Church are the ones who are going to be the most responsible on the Day of Judgment because we've received the whole thing, the whole tradition, everything, all of Christianity. We have it and have access to it. And so that makes us more accountable for what we do or don't do with it and what we learn and what we don't learn and what we practice and what we don't practice. God is also. Christ is going to judge everybody. He's also going to judge those people outside the church. He's going to judge non Christians. He's going to judge ancient people outside of Israel. We know he's going to hold them accountable for what they did with what they received. And that in pretty much all cases is less right? Unless they, unless they, you know, were aware. Unless they're like an Israelite who's aware of the Torah and decides to move to Moab and become a Moabite, worship chemosh, right? Then he's going to be super accountable because he received the whole thing and rejected the truth. Right, but, but your person who's in ignorance, who's sort of doing the best they can, right? Your person who lived his whole life and died in 13th century France and never saw an Orthodox church, right? He went to the only Christian church in his Village, Right. God's. God's going to judge that person based on what he did with what he had, not on what he did and didn't have."}

And with that in mind, that the noose is not a reasoning, not a discursive issue. Some years ago, I heard a science podcast in the end episode which raised the question, can a child think before he or she can talk? And they give a few. They give, I think, three stories. I know number two, an adult man who was taught to talk, and then he lost his ability to communicate with others like him who couldn't talk because now he could reason and use words. And he lost his ability that he had to communicate with some other guys. And there was another woman who was. She was college educated, and something happened to her brain. She wasn't able to talk or think. And then she regained it, and she was able to reflect on the period of time when she could not talk or think. And she heard she couldn't talk or speak in words, but she had. She started talking about some. Some method of thinking that she had during that time period. And it made me think, is maybe this an organic reflection of the noose, like in a child's brain that can't talk yet? Is there were they. Would the noose. We're told to have faith like a child. Would that be what might be going on there? Am I making sense?"}

The discursive reasoning faculty and. Right. That is true. Right. They're not the same thing. And I think that's an important place to start. Like, that's what we're talking about, that you are not your thoughts. And also that the nous is not the only way to receive knowledge. Right. And so when you talked about people, for instance, who are, either, you know, physically immature or then. Then had an injury or something like that, and yet they still were able to perceive, and then even later could kind of comment on that, just show. That's just an illustration of what we're talking about, that there's lots of different ways to Know, and there's lots of different ways that thoughts come into, you know, into your mind. Right. So, Father, did you have anything you want to add to that or correct or whatever?"}

We've got to be careful when we. When we use. When we distinguish between Greek words. Not that what he was saying was wrong, but I can give you examples where the word dionia is used in the Bible, for example, where it basically means the same thing as news."}

When Christ quotes Deuteronomy and says, love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, mind and strength. The word for mind there is dionia. And he doesn't mean discursive reasoning. He means your mind. Right? So. But I mean, it's helpful as a label. And any label you use, we just have to say, this is a label we're using to make a distinction. It's not a technical term. Because if people start to look at it as a technical term, then, you know, for example, they start thinking different Greek words for love mean different things. Stir that pot again. But, yeah, it is definitely true that there is. There are ways of interacting with the world that do not involve language, Right. And if you, if you work with animals at all, you know this, right? Animals can learn to understand verbal commands and understand certain words and sounds mean certain things, but you could. They also are able to process and strategize, right. And interact with their environment in a way that they're not. They don't have thoughts formed into language in their brains, right."}

There are multiple levels. And putting it into words, like we said earlier, is. Is reducing it in a certain sense, right? You might, if. If you're a craftsman and you're making a chair, right. You probably don't. If you're a professional craftsman, every time you make a chair, think in your head discursively. Like, okay, now I need to make this measurement and make sure the curve is right.

They didn't have words initially, and yet it was. They. They could still communicate. They could still interact. You know, they could still. They knew who was who, you know, like, you know, A baby that prefers mom over dad, which is what usually happened in my house. But we did have one baby that, for a period of time, actually liked me better. Only one out of four, though. But, you know, like, it's, it's definitely a thing, you know?

But I would not say that the mourning dove that you accidentally hit with your car, it would be an affront to the Holy Spirit any more than hitting some other bird or animal. Right?

The key is that in that instance, right, it's describing the way in which the Spirit descended. It's giving an image. This is why, technically, in orthodox iconography, you're not supposed to depict the Holy Spirit as a dove in any other icon in order to not sort of give that impression that the Holy Spirit was incarnate as a dove or something.

People, people and things are usually compared to doves in the Old Testament. And this is not why the Holy Spirit. Let me be clear. This is not why the Holy Spirit is compared to that. Right. It's ascribing a white descent. Right. But in the Old Testament and in a lot of ancient eraser literature, doves are actually considered to be stupid birds. Jonah's name means dove, and that's at play in the book of Jonah that he doesn't have his head, right? It turns to figure out what God is doing. The reason why the dove returning with the branch at the end of the flood is so important, is that doves aren't very bright. So if it was able to go and find a branch and get back, that means, oh, the water must be mostly gone now."}

So the dove could even go and find it. Right. And so what what happened? What happened in sort of the tradition? It wasn't actually. The peace thing didn't come from the Holy Spirit, actually. It came from Noah's dove with the branch in its mouth. The olive branch was originally the symbol of peace or the token of peace. If you look at our Orthodox prayers, our older prayers, they talk about the branch, the olive branch as the symbol and token of peace, but they would depict the dove with the olive branch in its mouth. And so that whole image became a symbol of peace. And then people sort of forgot about the olive branch, and it was just doves. And then people started letting them loose at weddings, and they went to the bathroom everywhere, and it was a nightmare."}

So the one who has seen God, the one who has been, you know, in. In the presence of God, stood in the divine council and seen him. Yeah, and the angelic hosts. And another good example of this sort of noetic site is the story of Elisha and his servant Gehazi."}

So, yeah, so for those who aren't super familiar with this story, the prophet Elisha had this, this servant Gehazi. And there was this point at which the authorities were closing in on Elisha. As many of the prophets in the Old Testament, he was not a popular D dude. And so they were persecuted, right? As. As you know, Christ would later say in, in the Gospels, which of the prophets did your fathers not persecute? Elisha was one of them. But so as. As they're sort of closing in, his servant Gehazi is sort of terrified that they're going to die. And Elisha is on the other hand, totally calm."}

And so Elisha sort of prays and Gehazi's eyes are opened is the language that's used. His eyes are opened and he's able to see the angelic hosts. Right. The armies of Yahweh the God of Israel, like surrounding them on all sides and protecting them. And the implication is this is what Elisha sees all the time."}

Elisha is just living in the full world, spiritual and material. And that's why he operates the way he does. That's why he has the contentment and the ability to face the suffering and persecution. And giving that to Gehazi, then than helps Gehazi. And so when the writers of scripture, when we talk about the Holy Spirit inspiring scripture, this is mostly what we're talking about, what that inspiration is. Sometimes people think about that inspiration, like, oh, he went into a trance and then like he came to and he had written all this stuff and, oh, what's this? Like reading it for the first time himself, you know."}

Okay, so like, we're going to talk about some places in scripture where this happens. But like, so Genesis, obviously a good place to start at the very beginning. Like, there's events that happen at the beginning of Genesis that literally there was no one around to write them down. You know, like, there was no one there when God, you know, no human being there when God separated the waters from the, you know, and the firmament and the earth. And like, no one was there. And then, you know, there's all kinds of stuff that happens long, long before any of this gets written down. And the only way that someone would know those things or that a prophet would have that. That knowledge, as if God had revealed it to him. Right. You know, and yet further than that. Right. Is what exactly is scripture doing when these stories are being told through the prophets? Right. And this is really interesting to me because, like, it's often said, for instance, and rightly so, that the Bible is not a science textbook, that people who attempt to turn it into one. Whether it's people who are trying to do that to debunk it, or those who are trying to do it say, no, no. It's sort of the greatest of all science textbooks. I'm looking at you, Ark Experience. That's a joke for my dad. Yeah, yeah. He and I feel you just wait."}

You know, that that's not what its purpose is. And the fact that it's not doing that and we say that it's not doing that is not some kind of Cop out. Right. So, you know, when.

Like, I mean, if someone wants to talk about that stuff and is interested in that, fine. But. But that's like, not what Genesis is about. And Genesis is not even trying to supply that knowledge, you know? You know, it's not bad science because it's not science. And it's only in a world where we think that science equals knowledge and science is the only kind of knowledge that that's a problem, you know, like, well, if it's not science and how can we possibly trust it?

Like, it's not meant for that. That's not what, it's, what it's doing. Although I think it would pretty, pretty amazing if one of you people out there who writes, you know, manuals for appliances considered putting them in blank verse.

And yeah, we look at science 100 years ago and we think a lot of it was dumb, but we're not going to think that 100 years from now because we're smart and have it all together.

So there is a material reality that happened there. Right. But we're saying that the scriptures are that there to describe that material reality. They're there to describe the spiritual reality. Same thing with the flood. Right. The material reality is probably almost everybody agrees on this is the material reality are the earth changes that happen at the end of the last ice age. Right. But the point is not of the story of the flood as recorded in Genesis, is not to say here is exactly what happened. Everybody knew what happened. Everybody knew there were these earth changes.

But that's not what, like, the Bible story is. You know, sorry, philologists, it's not. It's not a philological textbook, you know, that's not its point. It's about the spiritual reality behind it. It's about human beings attempting to sort of control God and the. What. The fragmentation that happens as a result of that. And then worse still, that the various tribes and nations become subject to. Initially. Well, initially it's good God puts them in the hands of angelic powers, but then it becomes bad when those angelic powers fall by accepting worship from those nations. It's about the rise of paganism and the rise of idolatry."}

We quoted in a previous episode from anthropologists and sociologists talking about this. This is a thing that happened in human history, right. And what the Scriptures is revealing is what was going on there, the spiritual reality that laid behind those events. Same thing is true with the Exodus. We talked about the Exodus in the Pascha episode, right? There were these locks connected to the Red Sea that the Israelites had to cross to get out of Egypt."}

And it's the same reason why, like, again, that. That approach, you know, it's. It's like like when I was an undergrad, one of my favorite poets was John Keats, and he's got this amazing poem called To Autumn, which I read every year at Autumn. You know, but a physics textbook cannot explain why. That's beautiful. That can only really be understood in spiritual terms. Like, it only makes sense that way. Right. So. So, yeah, I mean, you know, this. This problem gets repeated over and over again as people are trying to read scripture. We have to understand it's all apocalyptic. You know, another example is the conquest of Canaan. Right. Where you've got. There's a material thing happening, this migration of these Hebrew tribes, but there's also a spiritual side, which is the gigantomachy, the defeat of the giant clans. That's also happening. That's. And that's what the scripture is revealing to us. You know, it's passing on this apocalypse."}

And then you get into the other historical books. You get into the books of kingdoms, or 1st and 2nd Samuel 1, 2nd kings, the parallel in 1st and 2nd chronicles. And 1st of all, it's sort of like it's chronicling the kings of. Of Israel and Judah. But then also it just zags for a whole bunch of chapters. It talks about Elijah and Elisha, who aren't kings."}

But you go outside to the archaeological record, and all of Israel's neighbors referred to Israel as the house of Omri Beit Omri long after his dynasty was even gone. He was one of the most powerful and successful kings in the Northern kingdom's history, if not the most and influential in terms of Israel's neighbors at the global scale. Bible just set six verses. He's wicked. Right, that's it. And you see this refrain all the time in those books where it says, you know, as for everything else, this wicked guy did Is it not recorded in the annals of the kings of Israel? Right. So yeah, you could go there and get the material history. Right. It's there in their official annals. All the battles they fought, the territory they, they took, the taxes they raised, the, the things building projects. You can read all that there scriptures are here to reveal to you the spiritual reality behind that."}

So then, you know, perhaps in a more obvious section of the Old Testament in the prophets, that this is apocalyptic as well. Right. And you, so you, then you start getting prophets like Isaiah who sees God on his throne, Right. And, and reveals that kind of thing. Like this is, this is apocalypse in a way that makes, that's a little bit more obvious to us, I think. Right. So, so what are some more examples of, of that from those prophets?"}

So there's more subtle examples. I mean, what Isaiah, Jeremiah and Ezekiel are essentially doing is Isaiah, you know, before the fall of the northern kingdom or at the fall of the northern kingdom, Jeremiah at the fall of Judah to the Babylonians and Ezekiel in exile is, you know, the people know either, hey, the Assyrians are coming to kill everybody or the Babylonians are coming to kill everybody and enslave the rest, or we're in exile. They know that. Right. The prophet doesn't have to come and reveal that to them the dates where they were living. Right. The prophet comes to reveal to them, here's why, here's why the Assyrians are coming, here's why the Babylonians are coming, here's why you're in exile, and here's how God is going to bring you out of this. Here's how we ended up here. Here's what you need to do now in terms of repentance. And then here's how God is going to deliver us from this, from the consequences of our own, of our own sins and wickedness. And then you get the really obvious ones like Daniel and Zechariah, where they're actually apocalyptic texts, right?"}

Because in these more expansive apocalyptics. And the Book of Enoch is, is this too. Right? The Book of Enoch is actually several of these put together and other Enoch literature is mostly apocalypses, but it has this vast sweep of history. It covers from the beginning, all the way through the history of God's people, all the way to the end. Right. And as modern people, I guess we're more fascinated by trying to figure out what's ahead, what's in the future for us, which is the end, rather than trying to actually understand our past and our heritage and how we got here, which to me is backwards. Right, right. But yeah, so that it's. It's the whole sweep. Right. Not just. Not just here's a bunch of stuff that's going to happen in the future so that you can figure out when the end is coming. Exactly. And so when we say this is everywhere in the Bible, Right. Probably the place where people would think this exists the least might be the Epistles of St. Paul. Because modern Western Christians, we've been taught that, you know, St. Paul's writing theology. Right. Which of course isn't true either. He's writing letters to churches and to people, but he's sitting there, right. He's writing theology. This is discursive reasoning. You know, we're going to go and analyze his grammar and his logical arguments. Right? Da, da, da, da, da, da, da. But if you read St. Paul closely and you look at the actual structure of his epistles, he will make a series of theological points. And these aren't just any theological points. These aren't sort of premise one. Right. Premise two. Right, right. These are theological points like the first chapter of Ephesians. Right. We've been adopted as sons of God. We're already seated with Christ in the heavenly places. Right. This is. This is visionary type stuff. Right. This is revealing spiritual reality type stuff. This is. This is the spiritual reality. And then at some point in the Epistle, it's almost always translated into English as therefore."}

He shows us that God meets us where we are in the pain and heartache of the present moment. Instead of looking for way to escape from hardship, we can cultivate an attitude of gratitude, peace and self acceptance that will transform our experience of suffering. Drawing on his own experiences and his work as a consultant in the behavioral health industry, as well as stories of saints and sufferers, teachings of the fathers, and recent discoveries in neuroscience, Phillips shows us that the journey to personal well being is one we can all travel, regardless of the hardships we may face.

{"episode_id":"LOS - #024 - 2021-07-22 - Apocalypse Now and Then","start":6771.91,"end":6870.29,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Yes. Right. So how does that. Yeah, you might be thinking, well, in what way or how does that work? And that would be a very rational thing to wonder. Right? I mean, we could do like whole episodes on this, and we actually do plan to do some episodes on stuff that specifically in the liturgy. There are a lot of things revealed in the liturgy, but I would say that among the foremost would be the presence of God to his people. Like when we say Christ is in our midst, you know, remember that the liturgy is fundamentally a sacrificial meal that we share with our God, and He offers himself for us to us. Right. And so we, we feed upon him and he is revealed to us. He becomes known to us. You know, just like happens in the breaking of the bread at Emmaus, he becomes known to us in the breaking of the bread. Right. So fundamentally, the Divine Liturgy reveals Christ. There's a lot of other things we could say about, about that revelation of Christ, but that's the most fundamental part of it. It is, it is an unveiling. It is a pulling back of the veil. And certainly there's liturgical bits that kind of indicate that, like, for instance, the opening of the, the holy doors and the kunastasis, you know, that's an indication of part of what's happening there. So, Father, you got anything to add?"}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #024 - 2021-07-22 - Apocalypse Now and Then","start":6871.33,"end":6943.31,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Well, yeah, there's the very literal, right. The opening and closing of the doors, the opening and closing of the curtain, the Veiling and removal of the veils from the gifts. But, yeah, this idea of noetic revelation is deeply built into the words of the liturgy. And I think exhibit A of that is actually in the epiclesis of the liturgy of St. Basil the Great. The epiclesis of St. John Chrysostom. It's make this bread, right, to be the body. Make that which is in this cup to be the blood of Christ making the change by the Holy Spirit. The Epiclesis of St. Basil the Great, it is show this bread to be and show this cup to be. So the idea of showing, revealing, seeing the spiritual reality of Christ's body and blood that permeates the gifts is sort of right there in the language."}

I don't know why this didn't occur to me earlier, but, you know, after we receive Holy Communion, then we sing what we have seen the true light. We have received the heavenly spirit. Right. We're basically saying we've received this apocalypse. Right. That's what's happening right after you commune, you know, so, yeah, I mean, it's everywhere. It is an apocalypse. Yeah, yeah.

So again, like we said at the beginning of the last act, right. The question we get all the time is, how do we actually. I guess it's the end of Act 1. What's the way back into the ground of, you know, the ancient world? Right. In terms of their way of seeing the world. And so what we were talking about at the end of Act 1, in terms of language and music and art and ritual, talked about how we in the modern world, due to what modernity has done to us, tend to try to reduce everything to language. Part of the way back is to sort of follow that path back the other way. Right. Moving out of that kind of linguistic rationalism that has so come to Cat. To. To categorize and describe Western theology, but to try to move from reducing everything to language to going back to iconography. And we have the. We have the tools to do this in the Orthodox Church. Yeah, you get. You can make yourself, even if you have to make yourself at first, right. Stand before or sit before an icon. You can make yourself put away the lyric sheet and just listen to the liturgical hymns. Right. And be in and listen to the liturgy. And you can come and participate in the sacraments and the mysteries in the liturgy. You can actually do this and fight that desire to try to boil it down to language and try to deal with it in that way. If you're not in an Orthodox church, this becomes much more difficult."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #024 - 2021-07-22 - Apocalypse Now and Then","start":7122.86,"end":7158.19,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Yeah. Because of the heritage of four bare walls and discernment. Right. You know, the, like iconoclasm leads to this reduction to language. Because when you pull those things out, then what do you have left? You just have that. And now, mind you, we're not in any way knocking language. Right. But language is one. One of the ways that human beings interact with the world. I mean, how could I knock language?"}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #024 - 2021-07-22 - Apocalypse Now and Then","start":7169.83,"end":7324.72,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Yeah, yeah. So, you know, the thing about the forebear. So this is something that hits home. Okay? So, you know, again, this is. I guess this is our scandal episode. But when that's your heritage, when that's the core of what church is, even when you then do have, say, music, which is another way that human beings interact with reality. The way that music is ultimately evaluated within that context is in terms of the lyrics, you know, and that's why, for instance, then you can change the genre, can sound however you like. And there's no. Within that particular context, there is no argument against death metal in church if the lyrics are good. Right. Because all that matters is the language. Now, almost every Christian would sort of viscerally understand that death metal doesn't work work in church. I'm sure there's some of you out there that probably don't agree with that. But, you know, and the reason why I would say that they viscerally understand this is because that's super rare in churches. Most would like, no, we will not put that in there. The problem is that there's no good argument against it. When four bare walls in a sermon is the core of what your religion does, there's no good argument against it. So, you know, that's the difficulty when you make church essentially a kind of lesson. I mean, I'm in favor of lessons and lectures and language and, you know, all that kind of stuff, but that's. When that's all that you've got, it's going to be much harder, much, much harder to get back to. I mean, if we could put it this way, why not this enchanted experience of the world, you know, the noetic apprehension of what's going on, the full panoply of human knowledge of who God is and what he's doing in the world. And I mean, not to do too much, you know, follow civilization kind of stuff of this, but I would say that, you know, that a religion that emphasizes language to the exclusion of this other stuff, or at least to the detriment of it, tends to help people become secular, frankly. You know, that's. That's what I think anyway, so. Yeah, yeah, yeah."}

That's just talking about, like, we have this sense that there's something deeper and more authentic than language. Now, language becomes vivified when it's filled with authentic life. Right. When it has the whole. When it's within the context of all the rest of this, then it becomes what it should be. So, like, liturgy itself has a lot of language. Right. Has a lot of language, but it's only able to do what it does within the context of the ritual of the liturgy."}

And that's why in the Orthodox Church, we understand that the liturgy, worship, ritual has to be completely inflexible. Right? Because to mold something, the mold has to be completely firm. You can't mold Jello with Jell O. Right. If you try to mold something with Jello, the Jello will be shaped to the thing. The thing will not be shaped to the mold. And so if. If liturgy and worship and ritual aren't inflexible, then that is exactly what happens. We shape our worship to ourselves rather than the worship shaping us to it and the worship given by God shaping us to Christ, to God himself."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #024 - 2021-07-22 - Apocalypse Now and Then","start":7523.15,"end":7648.44,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Yeah, yeah, yeah. And I mean, we can't state this strongly enough because there are a lot of kinds of worship out there that within particular traditions that have this idea, the tradition has this idea that it needs to be constantly changed to sort of keep up with the times, for instance. But if worship is supposed to shape you, but you're constantly shaping it, then all you get is worship that's shaped like you. That's what you get. It's not then going to do the work of cleansing your noose so you can apprehend spiritual reality. And worship should not be altered to the times because then it doesn't do the work. And also, frankly, you know, it can't just be changed by issuing a decree. Let's just radically revamp it or, you know, cut this off or whatever it might be. That's not the way that. That's not the way that the worship that actually does this work works. Right. Because again, then it's. Then it's being. Then it's subject to a human will, right? Now, that's not to say, I mean, we could get this as a long rabbit trail potentially. But that's not to say that, like, for instance, I'm not claiming that the way that we worship in all its exact details on Sunday morning in our church here in Emmaus is the exact way that the apostles worship. That's not what I'm saying. You know, the liturgics have changed over time, but not in any utterly radical or fundamental way. Right. The kinds of changes that have occurred are not the thing that we're talking about now. You know, when the problem is when someone essentially says, we need to re envision what worship is, that's when you have the problem. Or we need to basically stop doing the tradition we've done for all these centuries and start something else now. That's the kind of problem that we're pointing out."}

The way that the scriptures see what we call morality is not detached from it is the same essentially as the way that they see worship as we were just talking about it, especially in relationship to the noose. This is why you constantly see over and over again and especially emphasized in the New Testament, right, when Christ is asked, what is the first and greatest commandment? Right. He gives two that sum up all of them. One of them from Deuteronomy and one from Leviticus. Love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, mind and strength that we referred to earlier. And the second is, like it, love your neighbor as yourself. Those go together. And St. John in first John says, he who says he loves God and hates his brother is a liar."}

Well, why? Well, we've talked about worship. Worship is hospitality, right? And this showing of hospitality to God, especially in the form of food, especially in the form of sacrifice, the showing of hospitality to God, this worship we're talking about, this is part of what noetically shapes us in the image of God and allows us to image God. And because we understand that not just me, but every human person, every human person who's ever lived is the imager of God. Right. Then the hospitality that I show to that image is the hospitality I'm showing to God."}

Yeah, every single one of them. And so this is why you see over and over again in the Fathers, giving alms, giving money to a poor person to help them is an act of worship of God. And though it's too big of a rabbit hole to go into here, we'll do this in a future episode at some point. The Fathers are all very clear, and they're getting it from the New Testament. The giving of alms, giving aid to the poor, atones for sin. How about that? There's a bombshell to drop."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #024 - 2021-07-22 - Apocalypse Now and Then","start":7913.17,"end":8096.24,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Right? Because it cleanses, you know, it cleanses that place, that person, and cleanses you, you know. Right, yeah. And the reason why all of these things are ultimately acts of worship, right? Like, I know one of the big conversations surrounding our podcast is like, what exactly counts as worship? You know, but the reason why all these things are acts of worship, as you said, it's this hospitality frame. But it's because everything that you do fundamentally is a ritual in the sense that you're in interacting with reality, right? So when you do the works of God, when you behave the way that God behaves, when you do, you know, his works in creation, especially towards other people, that cleanses your noose. It allows you to have the apocalyptic experience, seeing God, seeing spiritual reality more clearly. Now, it's not gonna be like an instant thing like, well, I gave alms yesterday. How Come, I can't see that. Heavenly hosts, you know, like, that's not the way that it works, right? But, but, you know, because the people who have those kinds of experiences, it tends to be something that, that is formed in them over a lifetime or in some cases, God chooses certain people to work through, right. In a way that we can't quite understand why, or whatever. But, but, but that's, that's what happens. And, and doing the opposite of that, like, you know, not loving your neighbor as yourself, that darkens your news because you're not behaving like God. You're not doing his works. And so then your ability to see spiritual reality is, is going to be more limited. You know, there's, there's some things that you can only understand after, you know, a life of all of these things. Worship, almsgiving, prayer, sacrificing your own time, yourself, your preferences. Like, all of these things, that kind of knowledge only comes through that kind of experience is not something you can get from simply hearing a lesson or reading a book. And that's why, frankly, if someone's going to be like a teacher of three theology and they don't have this experience of struggling in the Christian life, then while the words that they might use might be true, they're also transmitting a darkness alongside it because they're functioning with a darkened news, because they have not done the work. And that's something that everyone. I mean, this is a warning to me, right? I'm a teacher. Like, this is my task. So I need to be always struggling to do that. And I need to make sure I'm constantly being prepared, and I need to make sure that I have that blessing for my bishop. And I need to not check out of the spiritual life, not check out of doing good works and provoking other people to do good works, as St."}

That's why you could call that day the Apocalypse. That's when everything is revealed. And what Christ reveals those people is when you met that man in the street and you told him he smelled bad and he should get a job and he was a drunk and to get away from you, you were saying that to Christ. And when you met that man, and you bought him some food to eat, and you tried to help him, and you were kind to him. You were being kind to Christ. And you can't tell Christ to get away from you and call him names and be disgusted by him in the street, then walk into a church and share a meal with him in The Eucharist."}

{"episode_id":"LOS - #024 - 2021-07-22 - Apocalypse Now and Then","start":8174.27,"end":8198.9,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"And so the keeping of the commandments, all of them, both our worship and our lives. Right. This is what corporate cleanses the noose and allows us to see and understand spiritual reality. And in the same way, when we fall into sin, our noose is darkened and we become less able to see what is happening and understand the spiritual reality that underlies our life."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #024 - 2021-07-22 - Apocalypse Now and Then","start":8199.54,"end":8522.69,"speaker":"Fr Andrew Stephen Damick","text":"Yeah, yeah, yeah. So to wrap up, you know, one of the things that this conversation has really helped to underline for me is how really everything is ritual. And I don't just mean that it's. Everything is like ritual. Right. It's not just a metaphor for. But it actually is like everything that you do, you're interacting with reality. You're interacting. And because all of the material interaction that you do has a spiritual aspect to it, that means everything that you do is interacting with spiritual reality. We talk about re. Enchantment, and sometimes people think of that just in terms of what you see. And certainly that's one of the elements. And we've been talking about that because episodes about Apocalypse. But there's also this sense of participation, the question of participation in the spiritual world. Right. And it can be tempting to want to have a greater awareness of the spiritual world or interaction with the spiritual world in. In a quick and easy way. Right. So we've talked, for instance, about people who get into the occult or into psychedelic drugs, this kind of thing. And it's true that takes you there very quickly. Right. But you're heading into it without having put on the whole armor of God. You know, you're leaping off the cliff without a parachute, without wings, or whatever metaphor you want to use. And there's a reason that the scripture does not ever provide a quick and easy way to open the eye of the soul, the noose. Right. To apprehend spirituality. There's no quick and easy way because it requires cleansing. Requires cleansing. So if you go with a darkened noose, you Might receive some kind of spiritual reality you might perceive or whatever, but it's going to do something very bad to you. And we talked last time about what that does. Right? You know, just as scripture says, the, the eye is a lamp of the soul. If you're full of light, then you're going to be light. If you're full of darkness, then you can be darkness. But where this comes down for every person is that this should lead us to understand that the Christian life is a holistic life. It's not a life that has some spiritual things in it. It's a holistic life that everything that you do, every single thing you do is a spiritual act. Everything that you do is a ritualistic act. A lot of our problem is that we don't understand that that's true. We think that there are sort of neutral acts or sort of non religious things that we do, but there is no such thing. And the question is not am I going to do spiritual things today? The question is how am I going to do the spiritual things that I'm going to do today? So you know, we're all going to eat a, eat food, right? Am I going to eat food that is blessed by God because I asked him to, or am I going to eat food that I did not ask for God's blessing? And so it is a different kind of spiritual act. It's a spiritual act, but it becomes a different kind of spiritual act. Right. Again, there's no neutral ground. No neutral ground. So the way that you wake up in the morning, the way that you clean yourself, the way that you talk to your family, the way that you go to work, the way that you do your work, the things that you look at, I mean on and on and on. It's not just a list of sort of moral things. Your moral or immoral, like you have plus or minus points on a moral scale. It's that you are interacting constantly with spiritual reality. And you can do it in a way that is going to make you more like God, or you can do it in a way that's going to make you more like this, demons. I mean this is, this is, these are one of our great themes. You know, everything is a, is everything is about everything. We've emphasized apocalypse particularly. And what I want people to walk away from this episode with is a sense of the apocalypse of the ordinary. What that actually does when we understand that every ordinary moment is an apocalyptic moment, is the ordinary then becomes for us extraordinary. And by that I don't mean supernatural. I mean that we begin to understand and to interact with the whole of what reality is in a way that we can do it much more intentionally. Because like I said, you're always interacting spiritually. You cannot escape that because you are a being that has a spiritual element and the world is creation that has spiritual elements. So everything that you do is spiritual. So the question is simply, am I doing it in a way that's like God or am I turning away from him and becoming like the evil one? So that's my encouragement for everyone is to seek the apocalypse of the ordinary Father."}
{"episode_id":"LOS - #024 - 2021-07-22 - Apocalypse Now and Then","start":8525.81,"end":8812.27,"speaker":"Fr Stephen De Young","text":"Yeah. So we gave earlier in the episode in Act 1, sort of a very brief and very oversimplified history of philosophy related to this. Yeah. And the reason for that wasn't just to nerd out about it, but it was because we need to understand how we got to where we are. Right. Sometimes I worry that the way I in particular talk about these things, including on this show, may come off, especially in our current climate, political and cultural climate, as trying to identify the bad guys, right? Like 19th century Germans, bad guys. Some people might even, hopefully they don't. But some people might even think, you know, non orthodox Christians somehow bad guys, Anybody, low church bad guy. I'm saying these are bad guys. It's got nothing to do with that, Right. It's about the actual history, right? We're in a place, how did we get here, right? Doesn't matter who's to blame. We're all to blame. Plenty of blame to go around. I'm to blame as much as anybody. But now we're here and we've lost something. To be honest, we had it. We had it taken from us historically. Right? When the altars were stripped in Britain, that was top down. The English Reformation was not a move of the common people. It came top down. It was taken away. And what you see after that, in the whole, and continuing in the whole Anglophone world, what you see is an awareness at some level of what's been lost, that we've been reduced to language, that that some element of noetic side of the spiritual has been stripped away. And it comes out in all these weird ways. You have somebody like Sir Isaac Newton getting obsessed with alchemy and finding bizarre symbolism and structures. In the book of Revelation you have weird folk remedies and cures and what are essentially remnants of paganism and superstition cropping up in Puritan communities in the US who fled to have their totally pure English Calvinist religion. Right? Have all of these things going on and relatively accepted just because they're part of life. We are aware even when we want to deny it, no matter how fiercely we want to deny it, we're aware that the spiritual is there. We experience it all the time. And so it's going to come out in those unhealthy ways if we don't come up with a healthy approach. Right. And so Father Andrew just talked about the idea that these things have spiritual resonance, all the things we do in our life. I'm going to come at it from the other angle. Right. We tend to try to pursue the spiritual as spiritual. That's what Sir Isaac Newton's alchemy is. We want visions, we want experiences. We go out and we. Because we've still got this bifurcation, we realize, I have all this. I'm a materialist, I have this mindset. I, I need to get this spiritual back. And so we start just pursuing purely spiritual experience in this sort of purely spiritual way. And there are folks out there who bounce around from mysticism to mysticism and from, you know, meditative practice to meditative practice. It's trying to. To chase after that experience. But since the reality is that the spiritual underlies the material, the only way to get to the spiritual is through the material. These always go together. This is why St. Paul says, you know, I can have all visions, I can speak in the tongues of men and angels, I can have all gifts and prophesy, I could do all these things, and if I don't have love, I'm nothing, I'm worthless, I'm garbage. It's pointless. Right? Love is the way we approach these things. So if you want to get the spiritual back in your life and you want to really get it, the real thing, not the counterfeit, you want to get the real deal, then the next time you see it, you won't have to wait long."}

The next time you see someone who needs someone to talk to them, or more importantly, listen to them, listen to them. The next time you see someone who needs help, help them. And you'll be amazed at how as you start doing those things, the spiritual starts to come alive for you. You start to understand the world more. You're not going to go and find the spiritual on its own and add it to the material you already have. But through love, you're going to draw close to God and your noose will begin to be cleansed. You'll get your mind right and you'll start to see what it is that that's been going on around you this whole time, and you'll start to understand. And that's also why St. Paul tells us in Hebrews that faith, which should be translated faithfulness, is the substance of things hoped for. When we're faithful, all of a sudden all of those hopes and dreams, all these things that we're just sort of believing by faith or intuition, suddenly have substance, suddenly become real to us. So that's my closing thought. There's a very practical way to try to get back to where ancient people were. And it's not through esotericism or even mysticism. It's through loving your neighbor in very real and very practical ways that every single one of us can start doing right now if we really want to."}
