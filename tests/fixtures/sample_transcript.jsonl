They don't think like humans do, but they can recognize patterns in ways that sometimes surpass human capabilities. This raises fundamental questions about the nature of intelligence itself."}

{"episode_id": "TEST - #001 - 2024-01-15 - Sample Test Episode", "start": 48.3, "end": 67.9, "speaker": "Charlie", "text": "Sure. Intelligence is about problem-solving and pattern recognition. It's computational in nature. Consciousness, on the other hand, involves subjective experience - the feeling of what it's like to be something. A chess computer is intelligent but probably not conscious in any meaningful sense."}
